1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,480
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,980
Joining me in the studio today:
He reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,740
I can see that I'm destined to be permanently surprised
by us starting over and over again today.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,040
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,680
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,860
Hello YouTube.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,800
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,680
Every fact they get right gets a point and a ding [DING],

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,120
and the special prize for particularly good answers,
which is...

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
[Sings]  Hitting the taaable!

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,080
[Laughter]
Oh no!

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,940
Forgot my buzzer.
Completely forgot to bring my buzzer.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,300
Today's article is...
The coffin ray.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,280
[Coughing] 'I'm a fish and I killed Steve Irwin.'

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,580
GARY and TOM: Ohhh.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,660
GARY: So R-A-Y.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,860
Yes, R-A-Y.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,860
MATT: ...Charles?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
First of all, you're getting a point for 'fish'. [DING]

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,400
Heyyy!

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,960
But it's not the one that killed Steve Irwin.

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,600
No, that one's already been sent to the electric chair.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,280
That was also a sting ray, which...

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
["Stingray" riff]
Da da laa dup daaa dup!

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,460
["Stingray" bassline]
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom!

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,340
[Steve Irwin voice]
'Crikey! I've got hold of it!'

27
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,220
'But anything could happen in the next half hour!'

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,300
No... he was killed by a stinger.

29
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,320
This is a coffin ray, so it kills with...?

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,760
Coffins!

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,940
Just chucking boxes at folk.

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,680
Shark... 'Come on! I'll 'ave yer!'

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,600
Yaaagh!

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,560
Scuba diver... Boom!

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,100
What you don't realize is,
he's actually a skilled carpenter as well.

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,040
Is it some new version of like, Donkey Kong?

37
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,920
GARY: Yeah! Totally!

38
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,020
You know, for the Wii,
now you've got 3-D graphics, and...

39
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,080
Monkey and barrels, done to death.

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,500
Right... boom!

41
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,900
Lob a coffin...

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,120
The thing is: beautiful brass handles,
all done out inside...

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,380
Bonus points if you can get the door to open,

44
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,860
and close on what you're throwing it at...

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,900
and then it lands in the hole.

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,400
Let's face it: that's the undertaker's dream, isn't it.

47
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,460
It's got the diver going, 'Dat da da da...'

48
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,820
'What the... ooof!'
Boom! Doors closing — sea bed.

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,100
I like Gary's idea. You've got some sort of
Rube Goldberg machine...

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,480
So on the one hand, you've got your stiff laid out here,
your coffin here,

51
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,680
And just differently weighted catapults:
Badoong...

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,240
Whoosh — boomf!
[Laughter]

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,940
The coffin ray kills with something that isn't a stinger.

54
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Kindness.

55
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,680
Withering put-downs.

56
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,640
'I've seen better.'

57
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,440
Actually, he's got his tail,
that's in the shape of a pipe there.

58
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,680
Yeah, just swept round.
Well, if it's not a stinger...!

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,460
Is it electrocution?

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,320
TOM: Yes it is. Have a point. [DING]
CHRIS: Heyyy!

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Why the coffin ray, then?
I have never seen an electric coffin.

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,720
Though I do want neon round mine, I've said that.

63
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,620
[Laughter]
Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,660
CHRIS: That'd be cool.

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,100
GARY: That's just a car battery
you'd need in there, isn't it?

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,940
Bzzt... bzzt.
'Occupied'.

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,800
'No Rooms'.

68
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,620
That is a good question, actually:
Why would it be called the coffin ray?

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,740
Given in mind it's a ray, so it's a flat fish.

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,980
Does it kill you?

71
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,520
Probably because it's got that distinctive shape.

72
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,360
That's a coffin shape.

73
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,280
*You* get a point... [DING]
*You're* wrong — it doesn't.

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,920
Normally it gives you a nasty shock,
but it doesn't generally kill people.

75
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,820
But you're right, it gets bloated after...

76
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah. It's in your wardrobe at night when you get home...

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,780
GARY: Boo!
CHRIS: Aagh!

78
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,740
Wouldn't be so bad,
but it's filled the damn thing with water to survive!

79
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,780
TOM: Bloosh!
GARY: Actually no, it's...

80
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,920
It's in your bog system, isn't it?
[Laughter]

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,340
Bzzt! Bzzt!

82
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,340
'Occupied'.

83
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,580
It's also called the crampfish.

84
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,980
GARY: The crampfish?
TOM: Crampfish.

85
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,320
Is it because the electric shock merely inspires cramp?

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,840
No, it's because whoever it's with is made to look s***.

87
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,340
[Laughter]
Cramps your style, man.

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,260
Yes. The electric ray kills you with an electric shock,
or attempts to kill you with an electric shock.

89
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,040
How does it generate that?

90
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,620
Friction!

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,740
It's got a piece of carpet on the bottom of the river...
[Laughter]

92
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,000
Goes back and forth and then sits there,

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,380
going, 'F***ing Steve Irwin!'

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
I was going to say, pedal-powered dynamo behind it.
[Laughter]

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Ah, that's brilliant!
What does it pedal with? It's got no feet.

96
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Little wings, it's got.

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,820
No, it's peddling things. It's selling them.

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,780
Yeah!

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,200
Ahh! Just buys batteries.

100
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
TOM: Ah. Ah.

101
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,980
CHRIS: Oh. Ah.
GARY: He's got a battery? F*** off.

102
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,360
Er, point! [DING]

103
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,280
CHRIS: Duracell!

104
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,560
What, double A? What?

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,320
Surely it's a capacitor.

106
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,720
It was essentially one of the inspirations for batteries,

107
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,060
when Alessandro Volta and Galvani...

108
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,060
...stuck one in the back of his radio
and noticed it worked briefly.

109
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
MATT: It's got a lead-acid gland.
TOM: They were using it as...

110
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,620
Replace the steam engine with a fish!

111
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,680
'A bank of a thousand of these
could light an entire factory, Ichabod!'

112
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,040
'We've thrown one in the boiler. It's water...'

113
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,540
'Maybe we could *extract* the electricity.'

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,900
'And store it in a jar, or jug, or other piece.'

115
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,600
...a jug of electricity!

116
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,540
'Oh no, iPod's gone flat.'

117
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,840
Bloop-bloop-bloop!
'Crackin'!'

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,020
'Get the ray out...'

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,320
It is essentially what's called a voltaic pile.

120
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,380
I've had them. I've got an ointment.
[Laughter]

121
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,820
Yeah. Okay.
I realized the moment that came out of my mouth...

122
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,100
Surely just something that's not properly earthed,
so you can just discharge them.

123
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,700
'Get that copper pipe away or it'll arc.'

124
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,740
Ba-boom!

125
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,340
Shortest route to ground!

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,140
Where do we find it? If you want to go and find a...

127
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,000
Water!

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,380
TOM: Okay. Yes. Not giving you a point for that.
GARY: The seas.

129
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,580
CHRIS: Not the seas. Rivers.

130
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,740
MATT: Hot seas.
CHRIS: Big rivers.

131
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,680
Er... you're closer. It's essentially...

132
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,740
The Deep Hole.

133
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,660
Hull?

134
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,200
It's an ugly-looking fish that wants to kill you.
Where's it going to live?

135
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,400
— Australia.
— Point. [DING]

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
It's one of the few things that isn't poisonous.

137
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,520
It can actually generate up to about two hundred volts.

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
At what current?

139
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes, I was going to say,
'It's the volts that jolts; it's the mills that kills.'

140
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,780
TOM: It doesn't actually say that but, er...

141
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,080
Ooo...

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,120
It also spends most of the day buried in sediment,
with only a little...

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
Building up friction.

144
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,200
GARY: Yep.

145
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,940
'Don't you come near me, or so help you,
I'll stick you to the wall!'

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
But that is a...

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,740
It conceals itself on the sea floor,
which is a problem because...?

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
You stand on it.

149
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,320
Point. [DING]

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,280
It turns out that if you just have
the ray sitting there in sand,

151
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,560
and you just pour some seawater on it, what happens?

152
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,500
It goes 'pfffftttt!' and arcs.

153
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,260
CHRIS: Wow!

154
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,860
I thought that was the arcing, but no! First, that's...

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,520
No, that was the flapping of the fish going 'Water!'

156
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Building up the charge. I'm with you, yes.

157
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
You get a shock up it.

158
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,100
Yeah, you do. [DING] It's still strong enough
that you can get enough of a shock

159
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,240
all the way up the seawater you're pouring on it.

160
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,280
Don't piss on it.

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Don't piss on the electric ray!

162
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,200
I am... I have to look up and see if that advice...

163
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,940
I think you just don't piss on anyone called Ray.

164
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,940
That's true.

165
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,280
Men called Raymond have been
campaigning for that for years.

166
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,080
'Stop pissing on me!'

167
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,840
I can tell you that, having searched for that...

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,580
There's a lot of talk about urinating on an electric fence,

169
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,220
and standing on a ray...

170
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,420
But as far as I can tell...

171
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,780
GARY: No one's done the two at the same time.

172
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,780
No one has ever researched peeing on an electric ray.

173
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,840
Nobody's stood on a fence and pissed on a fish.

174
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,440
Australia, it's on you.

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
[Laughter]

176
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,980
If any of you have weed on an electric ray and lived...

177
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, you will have lived to tell the tale, but...

178
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
TOM: Yeah, do tell us in the comments.

179
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,640
GARY: What's it like?
TOM: Yeah.

180
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,480
MATT: Or a video response.

181
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,900
GARY: Oh yeah, film it.

182
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,460
Oh. Don't...!

183
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,760
Do film it... just from a very careful angle.

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What does the coffin ray feed on?

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,220
Normally. I mean, obviously it shocks...

186
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,180
Coffins!

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Plankton.

188
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
Er, no... bigger things than that.

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Big plankton.

190
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,240
Close. No.

191
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,200
Chips.

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,060
TOM: Erm...

193
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,160
MATT: Shrimp.
TOM: Like... you're...

194
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm nowhere near!
Stop trying to manufacture this as a clue.

195
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,000
[Laughter]

196
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,380
Well, it's something that goes with chips...

197
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,040
Fish!

198
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
There we go! [DING]

199
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,180
'Benthic bony fishes'.

200
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,020
Excuse me?

201
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,980
'Benthic bony fishes'.

202
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,940
MATT: Benthic?
GARY: Is that a brand?

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
No, it's a depth in the ocean.

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,080
It's a subset of the sort of strata
that exist in waters of the ocean.

205
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
It is! Have a point. [DING]

206
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,460
CHRIS: Heyyy!
GARY: There you go. Well done.

207
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,180
MATT: Benthic.
CHRIS: Yeah, it's the benthic zone.

208
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,980
I can't remember if it's the top or the middle
or the bottom, but as you go down...

209
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,820
So is that like in The Crystal Maze?

210
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,360
You go through one, then you get to the Benthic zone...

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,880
Yeah! If Richard O'Brien was in scuba gear.

212
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,780
And can we just pause for a second for that image?

213
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,940
...and all enjoy that image.

214
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,280
He would look like a pint of Guinness.

215
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,400
It's a three-quarter one.
They're cut off so you can see his bandy little legs...

216
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,860
Little harmonica attached to it just here.

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
CHRIS: Yeah. Yeah.
GARY: You'd need a little... well, you'd need a belt.

218
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,560
Instead of a knife in his boot: harmonica.

219
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,480
Yeah. And actually the harmonica
is specially adapted to work underwater.

220
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,480
CHRIS: Yeah, absolutely.

221
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,440
I was seeing a belt for weights,
because he's quite a light fellow.

222
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh yeah, yeah. He's a spry lad.
We're going to have to...

223
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,780
But he could have a harmonica clip there...

224
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Yeah, and we're going deep,
so you know he needs a lot of weight.

225
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,060
GARY: Wait, what are we talking about?
CHRIS: Going Deep, with Richard O'Brien.

226
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
[Laughter]
Good name.

227
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,480
You would pass through —
is the benthic zone at the top?

228
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,540
TOM: It's the bottom.
CHRIS: It's at the bottom? Oh, blimey.

229
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,640
So you'd pass through the blah-blah-blah zone...

230
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,220
GARY: Industrial, Aztec...
CHRIS: And as the pressure increases,

231
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,420
there are distinct changes in salinity,
and what can exist there and so on.

232
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,920
And apparently the benthic zone is at the bottom.

233
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,180
Can we now make Richard O'Brien's
Journey to the Bottom of the Sea?

234
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,660
I've just got the thought of it,

235
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,480
instead of being like your traditional
underwater nature documentary, narrated,

236
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,160
I actually want to see it presented by him doing
pieces to camera from the bottom of the ocean...

237
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,860
CHRIS: Yeah.

238
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,080
But all you'd hear is the honking, wheezing...
[Laughter]

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,880
[Honking, wheezing and bubbling]

240
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,760
When I signed the contract,
I assumed a submarine or diving bell.

241
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,800
[Laughter]
Or bluescreen.

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,880
You can't take a bluescreen underwater!

243
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,260
Take a greenscreen down,
and just 'Shop in a desert behind him.

244
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,240
'...the hell?!'

245
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,580
[Bubbling]

246
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,720
So this is Richard O'Brien's Journey to the Sahara
Under the Bottom of the Sea.

247
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,040
Richard O'Brien Drowns in the Sahara, Under the Sea.

248
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
Sorry, Richard.

249
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,220
There are some very large creatures that have been found in the stomachs of these rays...

250
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,240
Not just fishes. Any ideas what those might be?

251
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,160
Sharks!

252
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
Duncan Goodhews.

253
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,280
CHRIS: Max Bygraves.
[Laughter]

254
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,820
Not quite that kind of size.

255
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,300
A truck.

256
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,660
The International Space Station.

257
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,660
Brian Blessed's underwear drawer.

258
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,500
Big underwear drawer.

259
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,260
Salma Hayek.

260
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,840
[Laughter]

261
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,380
The Library of Alexandria.

262
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,620
A Mark IV Cortina.

263
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,700
[Laughter]

264
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
They're normally things on land...

265
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,800
A fridge!

266
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,820
TOM: But they are... they are...

267
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Tigers!

268
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,320
Not quite that big. Erm...

269
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,580
Vladimir Putin.

270
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,120
[Laughter]

271
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
You said, 'big things that live on land'.

272
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,840
We'll get there eventually.

273
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,520
Rats and penguins.

274
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,420
Awww.

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,620
Penguins?!

276
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,620
It's taken penguins. They've found...
penguins in the stomachs of these rays.

277
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm sorry, but I do find the image of...

278
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,500
a penguin poddling across the beach,

279
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,300
and then suddenly going, BZZZZT!

280
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,220
...quite hilarious.

281
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,140
MATT: Awww.

282
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,680
Would all his feathers fly off, and just leave him

283
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,980
kind of that pinky naked colour,
but with smoke coming out of his bill?

284
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,680
I met a penguin the other week.

285
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,860
Was he in a shop?

286
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,700
Did you ask him that question?

287
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,440
'What would happen if you were electrocuted?

288
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,300
'Would your feathers fly off
and smoke come out of your bill?'

289
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,700
It didn't feel feathery.

290
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 'feel'.

291
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,800
Hang on. Rewind. How did you meet a penguin?

292
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,880
Okay, later question: How do you *feel* a penguin?

293
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
But first of all, how can you meet a penguin?

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,460
Well, kind of like this sort of thing...
[Laughter]

295
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,480
'Oh my...'

296
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,860
So I was in the desert...

297
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,560
...of course. With Richard O'Brien.

298
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,200
So you were actually under the sea, yeah?

299
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,020
And in said desert, in Dubai...

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
GARY: Oh, right...
TOM: Dubai, okay.

301
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,840
Where anything happens and usually does...

302
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
Home of ridiculous buildings.

303
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,180
Yes. There is a ski centre in Dubai.

304
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,820
GARY: Naturellement.
CHRIS: Because you can.

305
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,460
Because if you've got the money to live in Dubai,

306
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,480
you can't afford to fly to France and go on real snow.

307
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,140
So outside, it's 45 degrees. Inside, it's minus 4.

308
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,920
Was he greeting you as you entered?
'Wak.'

309
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,420
They sort of wave as they run.

310
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,660
'Aaaa, it's Matt Gray! I seen you on the internet!'

311
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,820
Were you supposed to be in the penguin enclosure?

312
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,600
Yeah, they have sort of a
penguin sanctuary kind of thing in this...

313
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,700
TOM: For all those lost penguins in the desert.
GARY: For those lost desert penguins, yeah.

314
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,940
And yeah, they have a 'Meet the Penguins' experience.

315
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,720
You all sit on the bench, the penguins run in...

316
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,020
'Waheyyy!'

317
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,340
*That's* getting GIFed.

318
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,400
[Laughter]

319
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,220
And then they're like, 'Do you want to touch it?'

320
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
GARY: That's a seedy question to ask, isn't it?

321
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
'I'll touch a penguin.'

322
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,980
And the penguin... they get the penguin
to stand like that in front of you.

323
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
And you can touch its back and it... it feels like a snake.

324
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,120
ALL: Oooo.

325
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,580
Sort of waxy, scaly, rather than feathers.

326
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh, it would be, wouldn't it? Because it's waterproofed.

327
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah. It's got wax on it!
[Spraying noises]

328
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,460
'You can touch this one. We've varnished it.
You'll not do any damage.'

329
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,880
I was thinking sort of... that kind of thing, but no.

330
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,980
You'd just use a wax sprayer at the local car wash.

331
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,380
Come on. We're in Dubai...
are you going to think about that?

332
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,280
TOM: Yeah.

333
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
And then they said...

334
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
'Do you want to hug it?'

335
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,540
Were the actual words
'Would you like to hug with penguin' used?

336
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,420
Yeah! 'Do you want to hug the penguin?'

337
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,140
GARY: Yeah.
TOM: Yes.

338
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,660
'Yes. I would like to hug that penguin.'

339
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,580
What do they smell like?

340
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
Fishy.

341
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, I thought they would.

342
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Well, they're not going to
put some cologne on the penguin...

343
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,920
Honk honk honk!
[Spritzing sounds]

344
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
Ah, come on now.
A cat doesn't smell of lamb, does it? It smells like a cat.

345
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
So I don't know, why would they smell of fish
because that's what they eat?

346
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,300
Because they're a fish... ish thing.

347
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,040
They're not a fish!

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,660
Penguins aren't fish!
...am I wrong?

349
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,680
They're birds.

350
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,180
Exactly. Thank you.

351
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,940
For a minute, you're starting to doubt
your own facts there, you know what I mean?

352
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,400
'Penguins aren't... fish...?'

353
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,620
To be fair, I did actually have Wikipedia up at that point

354
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,180
just to check that a penguin was in fact a bird,

355
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,140
and not some kind of fishy thing.

356
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,140
All right. At the end of the show,
congratulations Matt, you win!

357
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,560
Yaaay!

358
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,440
You win a replica of the singer of 'Livin' On A Prayer'
made of small chocolate sweet candies.

359
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,540
It's a Bonbon Jovi.

360
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,780
TOM: Thank you very much to Chris Joel!
CHRIS: Well, goodbye!

361
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,120
TOM: To Gary Brannan!
GARY: Salutem.

362
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,180
TOM: To Matt Gray!
MATT: Bye-bye.

363
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,280
I've been Tom Scott. That's been the Technical Difficulties. We'll see you next time.

364
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,940
Are we making a series of crematorium gags here?

365
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,400
CHRIS: Yes. To be...
GARY: 'To go where no man has been before!'

366
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,820
Crematorium Thunderbirds jokes, let's be clear.

367
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,040
GARY: Let's be fair! We're not completely
stupid and irresponsible.

368
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,200
TOM: ...So he dropped out at nine miles...
GARY: Yeah.

369
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,680
TOM: Rode the rest of the way,
then the car broke down at mile 19...

370
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
and he just started jogging again!

371
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
ALL: Oooo.

372
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,940
GARY: That sounds highbrow and commemorative.

373
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Oooh, it...

374
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,460
As opposed to lowbrow and commemorative.

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,800
Lowbrow commemoration!

376
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,300
'Dave's dead!'
[Laughter]

377
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
'Back down t' pit!'

378
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,520
'We're commemorating this with a giant brass arse!'
