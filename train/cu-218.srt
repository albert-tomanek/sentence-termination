1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,400
New Documents reveal

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,240
how the WHO botched their coronavirus response.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,840
Plus, you thought American politics was bad?

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,240
Wait till you hear about the purges in China

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to China Uncensored,\h
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
It’s almost flu season. Which\h
means many countries are once\h\h

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
again going into lockdown over the coronavirus.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
Cases in the US are breaking global records\h
and experts say it will only get worse.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,880
1.1 million people have died from the coronavirus.\h
And yet “There is still no transparent,\h\h

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,800
independent investigation\h
into the source of the virus.”

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,880
That’s according to the New York\h
Times. They’ve uncovered internal\h\h

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,080
World Health Organization documents that make\h
the WHO look bad. Not that they needed the help.\h

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,120
“Internal documents and interviews with\h
more than 50 public-health officials,\h\h

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,440
scientists and diplomats provide an inside look\h
at how a disempowered World Health Organization,\h\h

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,200
eager to win access and cooperation from\h
China, has struggled to achieve either.”

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
That’s the understatement of the year.\h
And in 2020, that’s saying something.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,440
The documents say WHO leadership, “quietly\h
negotiated terms [with China] that sidelined\h\h

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,320
its own experts. They would not question China’s\h
initial response or even visit the live-animal\h\h

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
market in the city of Wuhan where the\h
outbreak seemed to have originated.”

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,640
And that’s a big deal because if we can solve\h
the mystery of the origin of the virus, that\h\h

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,480
could help scientists prevent another pandemic\h
and develop vaccines and treatments for this one.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,360
“At the same time, the health organization\h
pushed misleading and contradictory\h\h

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,200
information about the risk of spread from\h
symptomless carriers. Its experts were slow\h\h

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,240
to accept that the virus could be airborne. Top\h
health officials encouraged travel as usual,\h\h

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,640
advice that was based on politics\h
and economics, not science.”

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,920
It’s really hard to listen to the scientists,\h
when the scientists are focused on the politics.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,960
The Vice President of Corporate\h
Communications for Huawei\h\h

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,720
has suddenly died. He was an Irish businessman\h
named Joe Kelly. No details were given as to\h\h

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,280
what caused the 55 year old’s death. Though\h
Chinese social media had plenty of ideas.\h

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,680
“Some Chinese internet users\h
noted how Kelly’s death\h\h

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,120
reminded them of English businessman Neil\h
Heywood, who was murdered with poison.”

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,400
Heywood was killed by the wife of a\h
powerful Communist official Bo Xilai,\h\h

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
because he knew too much.

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,200
Joe Kelly was in charge of spinning Huawei’s\h
global image, and it hasn’t exactly been a\h\h

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,600
great image lately. So some netizens said maybe\h
he knew about too many skeletons in the closet.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,880
And since no cause of death has been given,\h
it’s easy to jump to conspiracy theories.\h\h

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,120
But maybe it was just an accident. Like that time\h
the head of a Chinese conglomerate died after\h\h

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,920
falling from a wall. A totally normal\h
thing that happens to successful people.

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Things are definitely being\h
shaken up inside China right now.

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,240
On my previous episode, I talked about the recent\h
major meeting of the Communist Party, the 5th\h\h

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,480
Plenum of the 19th Central Committee. And General\h
Secretary Xi Jinping is making some changes.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,680
In the lead up to the meeting, he\h
purged a bunch of communist officials.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,040
And following the meeting, two more\h
senior Communist Officials got sacked.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
Both of them had connections\h
to China’s financial industry.

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
And it wasn’t just them. “At least 11\h\h

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,760
executives and officials who worked in finance\h
roles had been placed under investigation.”

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,600
And it’s not a coincidence that a big part of the\h\h

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,040
meeting was about reforming\h
China’s financial sector.\h

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
But Xi Jinping’s purges aren’t just a\h
response to the most recent meeting.\h\h

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,480
He’s already preparing himself for\h
the 20th National People’s Congress\h\h

52
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,760
in 2022. That’s when the next batch\h
of Party leaders will be decided.

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
“Xi is starting to change the senior officials\h
for the upcoming 20th National Congress.\h\h

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Xi will promote more officials who are\h
loyal to him in the coming months.”

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Sometimes you’ve just got to purge the officials\h
who don’t make you look and feel your best.

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,080
The Quad: An alliance of Australia, India,\h
Japan, and the US designed to counter the\h\h

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,760
threat from China. This week, the Quad\h
began war games in the Indian Ocean.

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,920
These are called the Malabar\h
Exercises. They began in 1992,\h\h

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,320
but were just a bilateral exercise between the\h
United States and India. Japan joined in 2017.\h

60
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,880
This year is the first time Australia has joined\h
in. Australians may be a bunch of criminals,\h\h

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,560
but they’re the criminals you want on\h
your side. Plus they do a great barbecue.

62
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,640
Yeah, that’s me in Australia, eating a\h
barbequed possum. That was a fun episode.\h

63
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
And I suspect Australia’s involvement\h
in the war games has something to do\h\h

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,120
with the Chinese Communist Party threatening\h
multibillion dollar trade bans on Australia,\h\h

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,920
which I talked about in a recent episode.\h
Australia has responded by telling China to\h\h

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,440
“play by the rules.” Yeah, good luck with that.

67
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,040
China could impose trade bans on Australian\h
wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, wool,\h\h

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,560
barley and copper. Chinese officials deny this,\h\h

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,560
but they also recently stranded 20 tons of\h
Australian lobsters at a Chinese airport.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,200
That’s tragic. What if the lobsters\h
die while sitting on the tarmac?\h\h

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,560
It would be almost as bad as being boiled alive.

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,200
Anyway, the bad blood between\h
China and Australia began\h\h

73
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,800
when Australia pushed the WHO to look\h
into the origin of the coronavirus.

74
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
And they managed to anger the Chinese regime,\h\h

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,960
while simultaneously getting the\h
WHO to do absolutely nothing.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
And now, it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

77
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,200
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,440
Logan asks, “The last Cold War got us to the\h
Moon and gave us great technology like GPS.\h\h

79
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,600
Chris and crew, willing to make a guess\h
what tech this new Cold War will give us?

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Oh boy, the silver lining to any\h
war—new technology! And I have\h\h

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
a feeling this US-China Cold War will\h
give us marvels we’ve never dreamed of!\h\h

82
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,800
Especially if the cold war\h
turns hot. Like nuclear hot.

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,000
So what kind of new tech might we get from\h
such a war? Perhaps something like...the stick.\h\h

84
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,240
It's a versatile tool that can be used in many\h
ways in the Wasteland: as a walking stick,\h\h

85
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,240
opening up cans of soup you may stumble upon,\h
or as a weapon to fight off the mutants.\h\h

86
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,480
I’m looking forward to the day when\h
I can own one myself. How about you?

87
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,160
Ok, a close second to the stick would be:\h
quantum technology. It’s the new space race.

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
Maybe I should do an episode about that.\h

89
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
