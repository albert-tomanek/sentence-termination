00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,200
On this episode of China Uncensored, nothing
screams "peaceful development" like a gigantic

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,070
military parade.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:19,140
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell. Yesterday, China celebrated

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,849
the 70 year anniversary of its victory in
the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against

5
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:32,079
Japanese Aggression. Oh? What’s that? You
say you’ve never heard of it? Well, you

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,769
Westerners might know it by its less common
name: "World War II."

7
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:42,809
You might also be under the mistaken assumption
that Japan surrendered because it realized

8
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,390
it was no match for the American army. Not
true. For the truest facts, you need to turn

9
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,469
to Chinese state-run media!

10
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,570
Yes, the war in China, apparently, was the
"decisive force in defeating the Japanese

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,609
fascists."

12
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:06,660
That’s right, it was China that defeated
the Japanese! And now it’s time to celebrate!

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,330
That's why people all around China are getting
in on the anti-Japanese fun. From ice creams

14
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,750
in the shape of Japanese war criminals, to
super soaker fights with the Japanese devils,

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,710
to middle aged women dancing in front of a
giant Mao sculpture, or dancing with fake

16
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,240
guns.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,330
And let’s not forget the almost-million-strong
citizen patrol organized by the Beijing government

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,220
to patrol “every street, every alley”
for signs of “security hazards” that might

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,240
jeopardize—are you ready for this?—the
Commemoration of Seventieth Anniversary of

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,560
Victory of Chinese People’s Resistance against
Japanese Aggression and World Anti-Fascist War

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,140
Parade!

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,090
Don’t be fooled by the 12,000 soldiers or
nearly 200 of China’s latest aircraft, or

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,840
these never before revealed missile launchers
capable of delivering a nuclear missile to

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,420
the continental US.

25
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,980
This parade was about peace.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:13,300
The peace we have China to thank for. These
lovely soldierettes are goose stepping down

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,950
Changan Ave, that’s eternal peace avenue,
outside Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, a place

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,780
also known for eternal peace.
I mean peace.

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,590
I mean peace!
Ah, that's better!

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,440
And the amount of preparation for this parade
was staggering. A full rehearsal was held

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,920
in August, and everything had to be perfect.
Everything had to be in place, from the perfect

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,600
alignment of hats, to even…
Well they don’t want the parade to be a

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,620
bust, do they?! And nothing says celebration
over oppression like heavy handed government restrictions.

34
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,160


35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,870
For both the rehearsal and the actual parade,
there were massive shutdowns of roads, railways,

36
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,550
shopping districts, and a ban on hotel reservations
and art events.

37
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,640
And do you think this beautiful blue sky was
a blessing from the heavens? Nope. Authorities

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,709
closed more than 10,000 factories, implemented
a city-wide odd-even license plate rule to

39
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:21,480
cut traffic, and implemented pollution controls
across six Chinese provinces.

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,030
And hey, you know what makes a beautiful parade
super fun? Taking photos and not being able

41
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,470
to post them to Instagram. One, Instagram
is banned in China. But two, the wireless

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,150
internet was shut down. Not that it would
have mattered because orders were given to

43
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,770
censors to closely scrutinize all posts relating
to the parade, and all websites had to “promote

44
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,380
positive, sunny netizen commentaries.”

45
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,450
But who could find anything critical to say
about the Communist Party’s victory over

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,870
Japanese forces?

47
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,390
Historians can.

48
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,959
Yes, the entire thing is a fraud. And not
just because these women are models, and not

49
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,180
actual soldiers.

50
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,040
It turns out that the Chinese Communist Party,
the ones hosting this celebration about how

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,539
great a job they did fighting the Japanese
in World War II, actually did almost nothing

52
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:24,349
to fight the Japanese during World War II.
Almost all of the actual fighting was done

53
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:28,400
by the Nationalist Party, which was governing
China at the time.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,309
When the China front of the war broke out
in 1937, the Nationalists had one-point-seven

55
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:40,840
million armed soldiers. The Chinese Communist
Party--the CCP--had less than one-twentieth

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,930
the number of troops, and they were poorly
trained at that.

57
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:52,139
That's why every single major Chinese battle
except one in the entire eight-year war was

58
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,809
fought by the Nationalist Army.

59
00:04:54,809 --> 00:05:01,020
According to Zhou Enlai, in a secret report
to Joseph Stalin in 1940, over a million Chinese

60
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,699
had died in fighting through the summer of
1939. And only 3 percent were from the CCP.

61
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,539
So by the time Japan finally surrendered in
1945--aboard the American ship the USS Missouri,

62
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,870
by the way--the Nationalists had suffered
heavy losses.

63
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,939
Less than a year later, the CCP re-ignited
the Chinese civil war. And because the CCP

64
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,830
had been using the past decade to build up
its own troops, it was able to defeat the

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,539
Nationalists within three years, forcing them
to retreat to the island of Taiwan.

66
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:44,349
So how did the CCP really feel about World
War II? Well, in 1972, Chairman Mao Zedong

67
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:50,199
gave a personal thank you to the Japanese
prime minister, telling him he “didn’t

68
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,900
have to say sorry” because the Japanese
invasion actually helped the CCP beat the

69
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,699
Nationalists.

70
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,599
Yes, Chairman Mao actually thanked Japan for
invading China.

71
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:09,430
Oh, maybe that's why, according to Xinhua,
the "world community wants Japan to apologize"

72
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,059
for World War II!

73
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:15,710
Because if it weren't for Japan's invasion,
China would never have been ruled by the Communist

74
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,479
Party, and today it might be a democracy like
Taiwan.

75
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,669
But then we also wouldn’t have seen 70,000
doves released over Tiananmen Square. Ah,

76
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,360
peace.

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,610
So what do you think of the CCP’s glorious
history during, um, the War of Resistance

78
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,819
