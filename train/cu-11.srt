00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,960
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,940
how China is using tourism as a weapon.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,639
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,429
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,599
The Chinese Communist Party has a secret weapon

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,039
to use against countries it doesn’t like.

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,689
No, it’s not the new hypersonic waverider
missile.

8
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,609
This weapon involves completely different
kind of wave rider...

9
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,559
Chinese tourists!

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,569
The Communist Party’s weaponization of tourism
means

11
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:32,800
using the massive flow of Chinese tourists...

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,440
...and all the money they spend shopping...

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,940
as a way to punish other countries

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,329
for not following the Party line.

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,359
The most recent country to get walloped?

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,940
The Pacific island nation of Palau.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,969
Palau is here.

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,219
Wait, zoom in.

19
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,739
Palau is here.

20
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,579
Um... keep zooming in.

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,579
There it is.

22
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,940
Palau is here.

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,460
This country is so small,

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,429
that when they were having their flag designed,

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,520
they could only afford the basic package.

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,249
Not to say Palau isn’t a beautiful tropical
paradise.

27
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:03,329
It is!

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,620
It’s also one of only 17 countries in the
world

29
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,410
that still have diplomatic relations with
Taiwan.

30
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,759
That is, they recognize Taiwan’s Republic
of China government

31
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,750
as the legitimate government of all of China.

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,490
Obviously, the Chinese Communist Party does
not like this.

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,530
So they’ve hit Palau with what amounts to
a partial travel ban.

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,060
They’re doing this by refusing to give Palau

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,750
“Approved Destination Status,” or ADS.

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,930
I know, ADS doesn’t sound like something
you necessarily

37
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,140
want someone to give you.

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,649
But it’s actually a seal of approval that
allows mainland

39
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,320
Chinese travel agencies to book group tours
there.

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Without ADS, tourists can still visit,

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,210
but only if they book travel on their own.

42
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,900
And among Chinese travelers,

43
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,539
big group tours are still way more popular.

44
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,740
Palau actually never had ADS,

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,549
but Chinese travel agencies were booking tours
to Palau anyway.

46
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,520
You know, because laws in China...eh…

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,360
That is, until last year, when the Chinese
regime cracked down—

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,470
by sending a letter to all Chinese travel
agencies,

49
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,830
reminding them specifically that it’s against
the law

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,360
to book tour groups to Palau.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,950
And then the number of Chinese tourists in
Palau plummeted—

52
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,680
from 87,000 in 2015, to 58,000 in 2017.

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,250
While those figures may not sound like much,

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,440
about half of Palau’s tourists come from
Mainland China,

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,000
and about half the country’s GDP comes from
tourism.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So those falling numbers

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,030
are actually a pretty big deal for Palau.

58
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,580
Palau Pacific Airways, which once claimed
to be

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,690
“the best choice to get from Hong Kong to
Palau,”

60
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,260
announced that it was shutting down—for
good.

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,470
Manipulating tourism is one of many tactics
of statecraft

62
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,470
used by the Chinese Communist Party,

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,290
according to this recent report called

64
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,090
“China’s Use of Coercive Economic Measures.”

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,200
The report says that over the past few years,

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
the Party has perfected the art of weaponizing
tourism,

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,920
cutting off the flow of tourist dollars

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,000
as a tactic to punish countries

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,340
that refuse to do its bidding.

70
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,290
And the authors of the report warn: Y

71
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,610
ou ain’t seen nothin yet.

72
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,850
You see, Chinese tourists spend more than
tourists

73
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,150
from any other country in the world,

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,650
and those expenditures are growing.

75
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,890
According to a study by Nielsen, in 2016,

76
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,990
Chinese tourists traveled overseas 120 million
times,

77
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,550
and spent more than 260 billion dollars during
those trips.

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,000
And most of what they spent those billions
on, is shopping.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,910
Obviously for countries that host Chinese
tourists,

80
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,340
that kind of cash is nice to have.

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
I mean, even Newark,

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,070
New Jersey is getting in on the action.

83
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,810
So the Chinese Communist Party has learned

84
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,430
to exploit that tourism.

85
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,100
Back in 2012, when Chinese and Filipino ships

86
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,170
first clashed over disputed waters in the
South China Sea,

87
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,920
China retaliated by issuing travel warnings
to discourage

88
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,130
Chinese tourists from visiting the Philippines.

89
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,070
And it had a huge impact in some parts of
the country.

90
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,940
But lately, the new president Rodrigo Duterte

91
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,739
has decided to get all buddy-buddy with China...

92
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,280
...and the tourism floodgates have opened
again.

93
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,349
Duterte has achieved this partly by backing
down

94
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:25,530
over claims in the South China Sea,

95
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,900
and making *hilarious* jokes like,

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,320
the Philippines ought to just be a province
of China.

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Ha.

98
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Ha.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,449
And presto!

100
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:35,449
Within a few months,

101
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,169
the number of Chinese tourists grew by 40
percent!

102
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,599
And it could double by the end of the year.

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,729
Then there’s the troublesome

104
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,979
totally-not-a-country of Taiwan.

105
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,300
Under Taiwan’s previous president,

106
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,550
China-Taiwan ties got warmer and warmer—

107
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,099
culminating in a historic,

108
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,009
but also super awkward-looking,

109
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,020
meeting between the two leaders.

110
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,120
And tourism from China skyrocketed.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,319
But the new president of Taiwan since 2016
has been

112
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,139
a real Negative Nancy towards the Communist
Party.

113
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,830
She’s repeatedly referred to Taiwan as a
country—

114
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,569
which the Chinese Communist Party considers

115
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,999
just a stone’s throw from declaring independence.

116
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,760
And within seven months of her election,

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,909
tourism from mainland China was down 36 percent—

118
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,939
mostly because of pressure on travel agencies
from,

119
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:27,940
you guessed it,

120
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,069
the Chinese Communist Party.

121
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,879
Then there’s South Korea.

122
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,419
In 2017, South Korea deployed

123
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,909
an American-made anti-missile defence system

124
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,129
known as THAAD.

125
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,440
It’s officially designed to intercept

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,159
missiles from North Korea,

127
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,719
but it could also stop missiles from, really,

128
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,150
any aggressive communist neighbor.

129
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,069
And this was not lost on Chinese leaders,

130
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,979
who’ve hated THAAD from the get-go.

131
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,849
Within a month of deployment,

132
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,879
tour groups from China to Korea dropped to
nearly zero,

133
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,879
as this graph shows.

134
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,539
And individual tourism from China fell by
about half.

135
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,460
Cuts to tourism cost South Korea more than

136
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,030
15 billion dollars and four hundred thousand
jobs.

137
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,759
So for countries like the Philippines,

138
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,189
Taiwan, and South Korea,

139
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,689
tourism manipulation is a hard thing to fight
against.

140
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:19,629
You either play by the Communist Party’s
rules,

141
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,960
or suffer the consequences.

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,740
But then again, maybe fewer group tours—

143
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,880
and the trampling masses they bring—

144
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,180
isn’t always bad.

145
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,590
Back to the Pacific paradise of Palau.

146
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,849
It already had to close down its iconic Jellyfish
Lake…

147
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,960
…because of too many careless tourists.

148
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
And recently,

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,050
Palau has decided to shift from mass tourism

150
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,090
to what it calls “high yield, low impact”
tourism:

151
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,040
That is, higher spending tourists who

152
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,639
are more environmentally conscious.

153
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,620
I guess they want tourists from Northern California.

154
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,389
Meanwhile, the president of Palau

155
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,030
is showing no signs of caving to the Chinese
Communist Party—

156
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,479
no matter what happens with tourism.

157
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,370
Perhaps other countries might consider

158
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,050
taking a page from Palau’s playbook.

159
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,639
So what do you think about China’s weaponization
of tourism

160
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,719
as a foreign policy tool?

161
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,939
Leave your comments below.

162
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,029
And before you go,

163
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,719
it’s that time when I answer a question
from a supporter

164
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,590
who contributes to China Uncensored through
Patreon,

165
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,059
our crowdfunding website.

166
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,990
“Where do you see the future of Taiwan?

167
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,680
Reunification with mainland China,

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,909
or an UN-recognized sovereign nation?”

169
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:28,909
Wow, Gorden.

170
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,590
That’s a tough question.

171
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,750
I think that—so long as the Communist Party
rules China—

172
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,659
we won’t see either unification with China

173
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,180
or UN recognition of Taiwan.

174
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,849
The more the Chinese regime threatens Taiwan,

175
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,520
and the more the Chinese regime takes away

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,319
the rights of the citizens in its supposedly
independent regions

177
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,020
of Hong Kong and Macau,

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,229
the less Taiwanese people want to be unified
under that system.

179
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,349
So even if economic ties deepen,

180
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,129
Taiwan will resist actual unification.

181
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,129
At the same time,

182
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,000
if Taiwan were to officially declare independence,

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,860
it could push the Chinese regime to invade,

184
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,710
thus starting start World War III.

185
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,349
Or China’s threats could all be a big bluff,

186
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,469
and they won’t do anything.

187
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:14,570
The key here is: NOBODY KNOWS!

188
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,530
That’s why I think the most likely scenario
is:

189
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,080
Taiwan will stay in its current,

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,860
awkward limbo indefinitely.

191
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,120
The other possibility—and this is small—

192
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,710
is that the United States will change half
a century

193
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,150
of China policy and decide to recognize

194
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,190
both China and Taiwan as separate countries.

195
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,560
Because if the US does it,

196
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,400
the rest of the world will follow suit.

197
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,600
Now that’s not very likely,

198
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,630
but we do have a president who might just
do it.

199
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,660
With Trump, you never know.

200
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,300
Thanks for your question, Gorden.

201
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,780
And to everyone else,

202

00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,410
