1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored…

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,500
No!

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,380
No!

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,300
Don’t let YouTube shut us down!!!!

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
Whew!

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,890
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,730
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,250
At least for now.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,840
Because the way things are going...

10
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:22,019
Let’s just say YouTube isn’t making it
easy for us.

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,439
As if dealing the Chinese Communist Party
wasn’t enough!

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,220
I told you a few months ago that YouTube has
been

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,050
demonetizing some of my videos because they
contain “controversial content.”

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,770
In other words, they stop rolling those ads
at the beginning.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,750
And that ad revenue is a big part of how we
fund our China Uncensored team.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,300
It’s crucial to keep the show going,

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,540
so we can continue to bring you great content.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,140
Like, when I flew to the Philippines,

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,600
hired a fishing boat,

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,040
spent 57 hours on the open ocean,

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,100
enduring 18-foot tall waves to get to the
Scarborough Shoal,

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,460
a flashpoint of what some thought

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,320
could be a war between China and the Philippines.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,420
And plant your favorite flag on it.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Guess which video YouTube decided to demonetize?

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,280
They didn’t even notify us.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,740
Eventually my producer discovered it and appealed.

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,990
A week later—

29
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,670
after we’d already lost most of the ad revenue
we’ll ever make from it—

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,940
YouTube finally assigned a human to review
our appeal

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,760
and was like, oh, yeah,

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,220
that shouldn’t have been automatically demonetized.

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,490
Oops.

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,659
Yeah.

35
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,579
And that wasn’t the first time.

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,990
When it came out at the end of August

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,280
that YouTube was demonetizing people’s videos,
YouTube was all like,

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,100
“We haven’t changed our policy,

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,600
we’ve just started notifying you when we’ve
done it.”

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,510
To which most people were like,

41
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,360
you’ve been demonizing our videos without
telling us?

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,120
Well, guess what?

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,060
YouTube was lying about the notification thing.

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,310
Because for the Scarborough Shoal episode,

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,680
as well as many others, we received zero notification.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,920
We only happened to stumble on the fact that

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,500
several of our videos were demonetized.

48
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,800
Now YouTube would tell you that this isn’t
censorship,

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
they’re just making sure advertisers don’t
get stuck

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,120
with content they wouldn’t want to be associated
with.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Well, first of all—this is a type of censorship.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,920
If a show like China Uncensored doesn’t
make money,

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,900
it has to lay off its staff and shut down.

54
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,840
So YouTube is effectively incentivizing people

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,190
to only cover only non-controversial subjects,

56
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,620
and avoid topics that, you know, might be considered ACTUAL NEWS,

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,780
like war, political conflicts, natural disasters
and tragedies.

58
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,480
For example, the news channel I 
share this studio with, NTDTV,

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,190
told me they’ve had more than a hundred
of their videos demonetized.

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,020
In other words, YouTube is incentivizing everyone
to self-censor.

61
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,510
Which is eerily similar to what the Chinese
regime does,

62
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,930
though YouTube is doing it for different reasons.

63
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,260
And second of all,

64
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,960
advertisers already are able to choose what
kind of videos

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,080
and search words their ads get paired with,

66
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,020
as well as choose keywords they don’t want
to be associated with,

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,120
like war, political conflict, etc.

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,080
So YouTube’s argument for blanket demonetization is pretty thin.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
But it gets worse.

70
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,410
Shortly after the censorship controversy in
August,

71
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,600
YouTube rolled out a new program—YouTube
Heroes.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,940
That resulted in another censorship controversy.

73
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,260
Because it encourages people to mass flag
videos they feel are inappropriate.

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,260
And guess which country is already paying
people to do just that sort of thing?

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
So that’s a bit scary for China Uncensored,
too.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,350
And even if the heroes/trolls don’t come
after us,

77
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,280
there’s another problem with YouTube.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,769
A lot of users are reporting that YouTube

79
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,129
is automatically unsubscribing them from their
favorite channels.

80
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,880
Some of you have already told me you’ve
experienced this problem.

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,220
Maybe, check to make sure you’re still subscribed.

82
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,060
Fortunately, there is a way

83
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,299
you can help China Uncensored break through
the interference—

84
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,799
so we can continue to cover the most controversial
topics as we see fit:

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Support us directly on Patreon.

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,640
Patreon is a website that lets you directly
contribute

87
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,600
by pledging a certain amount per episode we
publish.

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,389
We started our Patreon campaign in 2015.

89
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,949
So far, the extra income has allowed us to
do things like:

90
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,409
Hire two new people;

91
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,309
hold fan events around the world,

92
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,160
and, most recently, travel to disputed Chinese
territories

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,250
like the Scarborough Shoal

94
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,570
and Taiwan.

95
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,480
And if we can raise more money,

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,310
we’re going to start working towards additional
distribution channels,

97
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,740
like building our own website,

98
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,140
and developing apps on streaming devices like
Amazon Fire TV.

99
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,200
We’ll still be on YouTube, but we won’t
be beholden to it.

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,880
That’s why your Patreon support is more
crucial than ever.

101
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,040
If you’re already one of our Patreon supporters,
thank you!

102
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,840
You’ve made so many things possible, and
I hope you’ll continue.

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,180
And if you can afford it,

104
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,439
please consider expanding your monthly limit,
even by a dollar or two—

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,930
because monthly limits are why contributions
plummet by the end of each month.

106
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,099
And if you aren’t a Patreon supporter yet,

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,141
please become a supporter now.

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,600

then click the orange button to become a patron.

111

Choose which reward level works best for you,

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,940
or enter your own amount manually, and Continue.

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
Then you can sign up through Facebook or create
your own user account.

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,870
Once you do that, you’ll have the option
of setting a monthly limit.

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,090
Keep in mind we usually publish 12 to 14 episodes
a month.

116
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,950
Then “Confirm and Pledge,” enter your
payment details, and ta-da!

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,120
You’re an official member of my China Uncensored
50-Cent Army—

118
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,729
the team that helps us combat the Communist
Party’s 50-Cent Army—

119
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,249
the people they pay to post propaganda and
negative comments online.

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,140
Everyone who supports us will get rewards,
too,

121
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,590
including China Uncensored digital wallpaper,

122
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,380
the original music from the show, and,

123
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,200
depending on your support level,

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,989
monthly live Google Hangouts with me.

125
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,139
And most importantly,

126
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,240
your support will help keep China Uncensored
uncensored.

127
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,980
So please, share this video.

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,180
Get the word out that YouTube is censoring
creators

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,180
by not placing ads on controversial videos.

130
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,740
And possibly unsubscribing people.

131
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,880
And again, please support this show on Patreon.

132
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,419
The link is below.

133
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,800
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,320
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
