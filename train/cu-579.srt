00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,140
the real reason the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,960
silences discussion of Tiananmen Square.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,680
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,560
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,920
Yesterday was the 28th anniversary

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,830
of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in Beijing.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,820
In Chinese,

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,180
they call it the June 4th Incident.

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,590
Which is like calling Mao's Great Famine

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,140
the time that everyone skipped dinner.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,130
The massacre was the Chinese Communist Party's

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,140
final, crushing response

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,780
to 6 weeks of protests

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,920
led by students demanding change

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,120
from the Party:

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,230
political reform,

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,370
less corruption,

19
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,200
freedom of speech and the press,

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
and eventually, even the D-word.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,010
Democracy.

22
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,680
Within the benevolent one-party rule

23
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,520
of the communist state of course.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,800
Those students weren't crazy.

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,010
The Tiananmen Square massacre

26
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,260
is still commemorated today by Chinese

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,420
outside mainland China.

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,030
Like with an annual candlelight vigil

29
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,030
in Hong Kong,

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,600
the only part of China

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,420
where people are allowed to acknowledge

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,460
that the massacre happened at all.

33
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,270
Inside mainland China, well,

34
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,020
the Communist Party called the protests

35
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,610
a "counterrevolutionary riot."

36
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,040
And they said that if anyone,

37
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
you know,

38
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,150
inadvertently stepped into the path

39
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,260
of a stray bullet,

40
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,660
it was only because the poor soldiers

41
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,330
were forced to defend themselves

42
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,400
against these criminal elements

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,810
who were viciously attacking them.

44
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,780
With their protest signs.

45
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,220
And bicycles.

46
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,560
What's a guy in a tank to do? And then after shutting down or destroying

47
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,890
anything that could poke holes

48
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,380
in the official narrative,

49
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,100
over the next 28 years,

50
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,450
the Party implemented a top-down,

51
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,740
state-sponsored amnesia.

52
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,970
Kind of like if Neo managed to wake everyone
up

53
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,270
from the Matrix,

54
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,590
but then the Matrix put everyone back to sleep.

55
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,630
Don't worry, everyone.

56
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,420
Zion was just a bad dream.

57
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Here to talk about

58
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,180
how the Tiananmen Square protests are remembered

59
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,090
is China Uncensored's resident Chinese person,

60
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,090
Shelley Zhang.

61
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,090
Chris.

62
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,150
Shelley, why do we still remember

63
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,240
the Tiananmen Square massacre so well?

64
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,430
At least, outside \hmainland China?

65
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
Well Chris,

66
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,430
there was a lot of media coverage

67
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,890
of the protests.

68
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,650
Partly because of a big coincidence.

69
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,130
There was an unusually large number

70
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,570
of foreign reporters in Beijing

71
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,850
to cover a historic summit

72
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,410
between China and the Soviet Union,

73
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,450
and the protests broke out

74
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,050
just before it happened.

75
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,020
Which is why you have a BBC reporter

76
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,570
experiencing this on the night of the massacre:

77
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,110
"The young man in front of me

78
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,330
fell dead.

79
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,500
I fell over him.

80
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,520
Two others were killed yards away.

81
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,790
Two more people lay wounded

82
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,690
on the ground near me."

83
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,250
Wow, that is intense.

84
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,000
So you're saying it's well remembered now

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,530
because it was well documented then?

86
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,260
Pretty well documented, yes.

87
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,260
As for well remembered...

88
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
we went to Times Square

89
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,680
to see if people would recognize

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,110
any of the iconic images

91
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,890
from the Tiananmen protests.

92
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,100
We showed them these photos

93
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,540
of people marching down Chang'an Avenue.

94
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,860
The Goddess of Democracy.

95
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,020
Tank Man.

96
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,420
And this Time Magazine cover.

97
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Oh no.

98
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Oh yes.

99
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
"It looks like 5th ave."

100
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,180
"That looks like the statue of liberty."

101
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,280
"I would say like maybe Chinatown."

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,690
“Okay, I just taught this.

103
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,690
Hold on.

104
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,480
Hold on.

105
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,460
I used to know this.”

106
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,180
"Asia somewhere."

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,380
"It's either Korea or Russia."

108
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,740
"How is this comedy?"

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,260
What?

110
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,540
Fifth avenue?

111
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,600
The Statue of Liberty?

112
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
New Yorkers think everything

113
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,910
is about them.

114
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,010
I like the Fifth Avenue guy.

115
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,650
If you can look at a photo of Chinese people

116
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,680
marching down a street holding Chinese signs

117
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,430
and think that's Fifth Avenue,

118
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,060
that says something great about America.

119
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,190
Did people at least recognize Tank Man?

120
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,630
Well, about half the people

121
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,000
recognized the photo.

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,459
They weren't all able to connect him

123
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,780
to the Tiananmen Square massacre, though.

124
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,090
But in general, people responded

125
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,670
more to the photos of the massacre

126
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,319
than the photos of the protest.

127
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,319
And I think that's because

128
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,319
we remember the massacre

129
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,890
more than the protests.

130
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,790
We're not remembering the whole story.

131
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,680
Take these protest photos.

132
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Are those the ones published by the New York
Times

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,390
that haven't been seen for 28 years?

134
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,319
Actually, they're my uncle's photos

135
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,260
that hadn't been seen for 25 years.

136
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,359
I found them in a shoebox

137
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,669
three years ago.

138
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,340
I don't get the joke.

139
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,810
I'm not kidding.

140
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,710
My uncle was a student in Beijing in 1989.

141
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,040
He took these black-and-white photos of the
protests,

142
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,430
and somehow smuggled the negatives

143
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,860
out to my parents.

144
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,060
And then I found them in a shoebox.

145
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
What?

146
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,770
And your parents never told you about them?

147
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,820
I don't know why, Chris.

148
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,380
But don't underestimate the lengths

149
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,560
the Communist Party went to

150
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,980
in order to erase the memory of Tiananmen.

151
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,750
When my mother went to China in 1993,

152
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,389
relatives in Beijing took her aside

153
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,300
and whispered that what the Party was saying

154
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,670
about Tiananmen Square wasn't true.

155
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,670
She had to tell them

156
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,820
that the rest of the world already knew that.

157
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,180
Imagine if there hadn't been foreign media

158
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,490
in Beijing.

159
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,300
In her book about the Tiananmen protests,

160
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,150
The People's Republic of Amnesia,

161
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,810
journalist Louisa Lim uncovered another massacre

162
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,250
that happened in Chengdu,

163
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,139
in the days after June 4th.

164
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,850
Wait, another massacre?!

165
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,850
Yes!

166
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,750
But almost no one had reported on it

167
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,410
in over 20 years.

168
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,590
When she was writing her book,

169
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,910
she used a computer that was never

170
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,530
connected to the internet,

171
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,680
and did not tell anyone

172
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
what she was writing about,

173
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,650
because she was pretty sure her apartment

174
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,880
was bugged.

175
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,110
That's how dangerous Tiananmen still is.

176
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,110
Wow.

177
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,620
We've talked before about how the protests

178
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,350
weren't just in Beijing,

179
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,340
that happened all over the country,

180
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,740
but it's crazy that the Party

181
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,360
was able to cover up a whole other massacre.

182
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,680
So is that why Communist Party

183
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,560
is still so intent on silencing

184
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,270
the memory of the protests?

185
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,340
They don't want to remind people

186
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,050
of their brutality?

187
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,750
That's definitely part of it.

188
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,570
In the aftermath of the crackdown,

189
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,850
China was seen by other countries

190
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,860
kind of the way we see North Korea today.

191
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,400
And overseas Chinese were also

192
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,290
hugely critical of the Party.

193
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,180
They protested in front of Chinese embassies

194
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,680
around the world.

195
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
My father,

196
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,350
a very nonpolitical grad student,

197
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,490
took me to march with other Chinese students

198
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,189
and their families.

199
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,760
But it wasn't just that.

200
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,580
You know, finding my uncle's photos

201
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,190
really changed the way I thought of

202
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,930
the Tiananmen protests.

203
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,610
Look at this girl's face.

204
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,610
We forget that there was

205
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,150
this hope and optimism.

206
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,180
That the protesters thought

207
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,200
they were going to make a difference.

208
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,300
That they could make the Party change.

209
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,760
People making the Party change?

210
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,270
That is dangerous.

211
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,270
Right?

212
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,270
In a way,

213
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,090
these protest photos are even more powerful

214
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,610
than the photos of the massacre.

215
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,820
When the protests reached their peak,

216
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,010
it wasn't just students marching.

217
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,010
Look at this sign;

218
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,060
it's from the police.

219
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,480
And there are so many kids in these photos.

220
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,790
These parents are taking their daughter

221
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,800
in her best dress

222
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,070
to see the Goddess of Democracy.

223
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,330
People were dancing and singing

224
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,360
in Tiananmen Square.

225
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,590
This is what the Communist Party

226
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,020
wants people to forget.

227
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
That Chinese people once believed

228
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,750
they could change the government,

229
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,960
convince the Party to reform.

230
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,800
That so many people across the country

231
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,860
supported something like that.

232
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,010
That they had that kind of hope.

233
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,330
That's what the Party killed in Tiananmen
Square.

234
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,889
Yeah, that goes back to the unspoken bargain

235
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,060
they made with people after Tiananmen.

236
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,360
Never question our authority,

237
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,389
and you can have a better life.

238
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,389
And by doing that,

239
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,810
they turned remembering

240
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,660
into an act of defiance against the Party.

241
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,020
Look at this photo.

242
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,160
That big sign on the Monument to the People’s
Heroes says,

243
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,650
"The people will not forget 1989."

244
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,970
Well, maybe we can help them remember.

245
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,970
Thanks, Shelley.

246
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,120
And thank you for watching

247
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,100
this episode of China Uncensored.

248
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,449
If you want to help people remember,

249
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,030
share this episode with the hastag,

250
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,240
#IRememberTiananmen.
