1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,840
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,420
I’m back from vacation—

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,620
and just in time for China

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,380
to make a threatening military action

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,800
against Taiwan!

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,960
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,679
I’m your relaxed and tan host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,460
You know what I like about Taiwan?

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,419
Well, it’s like the parallel dimension China

10
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:26,990
that has democracy

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,480
and didn’t destroy their traditional culture.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,090
And they have anthropomorphized food mascots

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,520
that serve you smaller versions of themselves.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Adorable and creepy at the same time.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,730
The mascot, I mean.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,850
Oh, and Taiwan's government officials know
how to play it cool.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,340
I want to emphasize our government has sufficient
capability

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,640
to protect our national security.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,590
It's not necessary to overly panic.

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,030
Not overly panic?

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,170
What’s there to not-overly panic about?

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,510
Military jets and navy ships

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,230
scrambled off the coast of Taiwan on Wednesday.

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,170
The latest sign of heightened tensions across
the water

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,990
as a group of Chinese warships

26
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,230
sailed too close for comfort.

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,100
Ah, Chinese warships sailing close to Taiwan.

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,900
That...might be cause for panic.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,770
Especially since the Chinese military reportedly
has 1,600 missiles

30
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,570
pointed at Taiwan at all times.

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,100
Anyway, on Wednesday,

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,350
the Chinese military sailed its only aircraft
carrier, the Liaoning,

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,430
through Taiwan’s Air Defense Zone.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,370
If only it had been a Sea Defense Zone as
well.

35
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,590
Even though the Liaoning did not enter Taiwan’s
actual territorial waters,

36
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,440
it was enough for the Taiwan military to scramble
F-16 fighter jets

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560
and other aircraft,

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,260
in a move that absolutely was not panicking.

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,130
That makes the third time in just three days

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,409
China has caused another country to “not
panic.”

41
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,409
Earlier this week,

42
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,240
China sent eight warplanes over the waters

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,930
between Japan and South Korea.

44
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,930
And over the weekend,

45
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,310
China sent a nuclear-capable bomber plane
over disputed waters

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,080
in the South China Sea,

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,259
where some say World War III could start.

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,260
But hey, why is everyone getting so upset?

49
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,969
I mean, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry,

50
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,209
this is totally normal.

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,300
It is normal for the Liaoning to go back and
forth

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,349
through the Taiwan Strait in the course of
training,

53
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,359
and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait
relations.

54
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,310
And he has a point.

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,340
Sending warships close to a country/region

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,029
you’ve repeatedly said you plan to conquer

57
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,989
is totally normal.

58
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,529
Which is why they tried it once before in
2013.

59
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:42,640
And it was totally normal back then too.

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,260
It's so incredibly reassuring

61
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,760
when you keep emphasizing how normal something
is.

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,299
Like when I used to wake up to find my roommate
Carl

63
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,439
standing over me with a knife.

64
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,730
Sure, it was scary at first.

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,389
But then Carl explained how it was a totally
normal

66
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,440
part of his sleepwalking.

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,220
Made me feel so much better.

68
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,049
Anyway, the Liaoning was normally passing
through

69
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,049
the Taiwan strait

70
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,769
on its way back from training drills

71
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,340
that it had started in the region on December
24,

72
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,950
Christmas Eve.

73
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,890
Of course it didn't have to sail through Taiwan’s
Air Defense Zone.

74
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,379
So was China trying to send a message to Taiwan?

75
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,800
Well, they may have actually been sending
it

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
to the Donald Trump administration.

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Frankly,

78
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,260
I would suggest maybe using

79
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,629
diplomatic channels next time.

80
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,620
Like having state-run media send him a tweet.

81
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,790
At the end of last year,

82
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,510
Trump enraged the Chinese regime

83
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,319
by calling into question the One China Policy.

84
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,769
That’s where everyone agrees there’s one
China,

85
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,840
without having to specify whether it’s the
Communist Party-run

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,400
China in the mainland,

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,340
or the democratically-run one in Taiwan.

88
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,650
Chinese state-run media even vowed revenge.

89
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,249
And earlier this week, Taiwanese president
Tsai Ing-wen

90
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:58,499
visited the US and met with Texas Senator
Ted Cruz

91
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,810
and Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

92
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Presumably,

93
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,019
they talked about all the things Taiwan and
Texas

94
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,540
have in common.

95
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,419
Like a deep-seated love of barbecue

96
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,809
and fried food on sticks.

97
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,209
And also how they both want to split off

98
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,559
and be their own countries.

99
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:17,060
All this is making the the Chinese regime
pretty angry,

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,680
since the US isn’t supposed to have official
diplomatic relations

101
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,590
with Taiwan.

102
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,350
Because Taiwan is part of China.

103
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,919
Even though America has vowed to protect this
part of China

104
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,030
from the other part of China.

105
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,070
Like by selling them weapons.

106
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,210
Well, the new year is off to a good start.

107
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,220
Happy year of the rooster, everyone!

108
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,919
So what do you think about China sending its
aircraft carrier

109
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,090
near Taiwan?

110
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,139
And how do you think the US should respond?

111
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,620

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,750
