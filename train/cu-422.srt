1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,640
North Korea is messing around again.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,120
And China is sending over the troops.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,639
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,469
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,460
If you haven’t heard, one of these Koreas

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,560
has a crazy cult running the show.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,920
Uh, okay, I guess it’s both Koreas.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,230
But unlike South Korea,

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,230
those in North Korea can’t so easily oust
their leader,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,800
Kim Jong-un.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Not that they would!

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,300
They love him!

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,390
They’re required to.

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,870
The Kim dynasty began when Kim Il-Sung

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,690
seized control in 1948.

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,690
And ever since,

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,750
the Kim family have been seen as gods.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,980
North Korea has no religious holidays.

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,550
But make no mistake,

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,940
this is a time of worship.

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,670
Last week, there was a fantastic celebration

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,300
marking the 75th birth anniversary of his son,

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,860
Kim Jong-il.

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,360
And yeah, the celebration was... ill.

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,870
They have really good taste in music.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,980
And of course nothing says celebrating your
father’s birth

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,240
like launching a missile.

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,260
Here’s the current leader paying his respects.

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,960
Aww, he was the good son.

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,860
Not at all like his no-good older half brother,

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,290
Kim Jong-nam—

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,930
the one with crazy ideas

34
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,600
like reform and market-opening.

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Kim Jong-nam completely ruined the celebrations
last week

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,930
by accidentally getting injected with poison

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,430
at a Malaysian airport,

38
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,360
and then dying on his way to the hospital.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,460
I’m kidding of course.

40
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,390
The celebrations weren't ruined.

41
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,870
South Korea on Wednesday,

42
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,260
saying it suspects a pair of female agents
from Pyongyang

43
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,440
were behind the murder of Kim Jong-un’s
half-brother,

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,180
and that they used poison to kill him.

45
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Over in China,

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,050
the current leadership actually liked Kim
Jong-nam,

47
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,210
especially his ideas about Chinese-style market
reform.

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,490
Reforms like those could have made North Korea
less crazy

49
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,610
and also less dependent on China for aid.

50
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,250
That may be why Kim Jong-nam

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,300
was under de facto Chinese protection.

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,410
Fun fact: So were his wives, plural.

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,230
Kim Jong-nam apparently had two separate wives
and families

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,990
in different parts of China.

55
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,190
Anyway, rotund North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,880
didn’t like his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam.

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,000
Daddy gives little brother a country for his
birthday,

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,230
older brother gets jealous

59
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,700
and says it’s being run badly,

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,850
little brother sees him as a threat and assassinates
him.

61
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,220
It’s your classic sibling rivalry.

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,600
So the combination of North Korea’s missile
test

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,950
and the high-profile assassination

64
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,620
is causing a bit of stress for China’s leaders.

65
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,760
Now, the Chinese military has sent 1,000 additional
troops

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,640
to the border with North Korea,

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,460
according to the Hong Kong newspaper,

68
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,600
Oriental Daily News.

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200
That’s very worrisome...

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,740
I didn’t think you could use the term, Oriental.

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,790
What’s that Shelley?

72
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,790
Ah.

73
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,920
I can’t.

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,830
Anyway, China-North Korea relations aren’t
going well.

75
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,220
I’ve mentioned before that Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,380
has been moving China away from decades of
historical closeness

77
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,670
with North Korea.

78
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,760
And this has been a bad week for Xi Jinping.

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,780
First, the missile launch.

80
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,320
Basically, if North Korea can launch a missile

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,010
into the Sea of Japan,

82
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,569
they’re just as capable of launching one
at Beijing.

83
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,080
Then there’s the loss of face.

84
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,390
China had status as the go between—

85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,330
the country that still had ties with North
Korea,

86
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
but could also help the rest of the world

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,520
put pressure on it.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,200
Well, it’s clear now that the Chinese regime

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,099
has pretty much no sway

90
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,670
over the North Korean regime.

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,760
And then there’s something called THAAD.

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,040
It’s a missile defense system

93
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,330
the US wants to build in South Korea.

94
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,230
The Chinese regime doesn’t want the US military

95
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,450
so close by building a missile defense system,

96
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,420
especially one that could also be used

97
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,000
to track Chinese missiles.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,180
But now it’s increasingly clear that China
can’t be relied on

99
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,180
to reign in North Korean missile tests.

100
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,200
So it’s all the more excuse for the US and
South Korea

101
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,740
to go ahead with THAAD.

102
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,900
And so when you’re the leader of China,

103
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,310
and all this happens,

104
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,600
you send troops to the border with North Korea.

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,560
This is not a first.

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Last year,

107
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,080
a South Korean news service reported

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,820
that 2,000 additional troops had been sent
to the border

109
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,450
ahead of a possible 5th nuclear test.

110
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,240
Which happened.

111
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,970
And there was no war.

112
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,090
But just like Kim Jong-un’s belly,

113
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,250
this can’t go on forever.

114
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,480
So what do you think of the deteriorating
relationship

115
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,290
between China and North Korea?

116
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,150
Leave your comments below.

117
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,440
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

118
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,200
Be sure to share it with your friends and family.

119
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Especially your older half-brother.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,880
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

121
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
see you next time.
