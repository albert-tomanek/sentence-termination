1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,420
It’s not just the NBA

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,660
It seems everyone is kowtowing to China.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,660
Blizzard.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,660
Apple.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,959
Even Vans.

6
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,470
The only one standing up to China seems to
be...

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,860
South Park?

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,740
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,180
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,880
The Chinese Communist Party spent the week
being very offended.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,710
Their public enemy number 1?

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,710
The NBA.

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,860
But don’t worry,

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,460
the Party has a much longer list of public
enemies.

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,100
Starting with public enemy number 2, South
Park.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,150
On October 2nd,

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,790
South Park aired an episode called Band in
China.

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,579
It was clearly creators Trey Parker and Matt
Stone

19
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,560
venting all their frustrations about Hollywood
and commercial

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,780
self-censorship to appease the Chinese Communist
Party.

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,870
Who here thought that they had permission

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,380
to say anything critical of Chinese politics?

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,560
Well, it is true, sir.

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,280
The Chinese seem to exploit their own people
with forced labor and…

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,200
Shut the [censored] up, Thor!

26
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,420
And obviously,

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,839
the show that mocked censorship in China,

28
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,979
got censored in China this week.

29
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,130
So the South Park wrote this:

30
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,780
“Like the NBA,

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,020
we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,729
and into our hearts.

33
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,659
We too love money more than freedom and democracy.”

34
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,640
Savage.

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,380
Almost as savage as the NBA and South Park

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,520
doing more to raise Americans’ awareness

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,060
about China in a week than China Uncensored

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,030
has managed to do in 7 years.

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,310
I’m not bitter.

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,850
But now it’s time for China’s public enemy
Number 3.

41
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,899
The video game company behind World of Warcraft

42
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,189
and the reason my college roommate failed
out of school,

43
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,899
Activision Blizzard.

44
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,409
The company banned “a professional Hearthstone
player in Hong Kong,

45
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,490
for a year,

46
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,259
while forcing him to forfeit a reported $10,000
in prize money.”

47
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,659
So that was at first a confusing statement
to me

48
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,279
because I didn’t know what a Hearthstone
is

49
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,130
or how much money you could make playing video
games professionally.

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,780
I obviously wasted my life doing some stupid
show

51
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,609
that educates people about China.

52
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,080
And Hearthstone is a free-to-play

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,850
online digital collectible card game.

54
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,470
Which judging from this image from

55
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,020
the Free China memes instagram page,

56
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,470
looks fun.

57
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,150
Think about it.

58
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,410
The Hearthstone player was banned for shouting

59
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,640
“Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.”

60
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,780
And Blizzard bars any players for

61
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,810
“Engaging in any act that,

62
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,810
in Blizzard’s sole discretion,

63
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,360
brings you into public disrepute,

64
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,280
offends a portion or group of the public,

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,730
or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”

66
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,780
Clearly, the player needed to be banned

67
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,790
for supporting the people of Hong Kong,

68
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,410
because that offended a group of the public—

69
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,360
namely, China’s Communist authorities.

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,560
On the other hand, Blizzard may also have
to ban itself

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,760
because their move offended all the members
of the public

72
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,060
who support freedom in Hong Kong.

73
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,100
There’s talk of a global boycott against
Blizzard.

74
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,790
And more unity from Democrats and Republicans.

75
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,180
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said Blizzard
showed

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,640
“it is willing to humiliate itself

77
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,070
to please the Chinese Communist Party.”

78
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,990
Republican Senator Marco Rubio said

79
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,650
“Recognize what’s happening here.

80
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,510
People who don’t live in #China must either
self censor

81
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,570
or face dismissal & suspensions.

82
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,450
China using access to market as leverage

83
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,410
to crush free speech globally.”

84
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,760
Wow, reminds me of how YouTube

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,069
demonetizes our Hong Kong episodes

86
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,790
because they’re “not advertiser friendly.”

87
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay, so Blizzard might be the most hated
video game company

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,730
in the world right now.

89
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,460
Even more than EA.

90
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,260
But at least Activision Blizzard

91
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,350
successfully got out in front of this and
avoided

92
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,569
becoming public enemy number one in China,
right?

93
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,460
Well, unfortunately for Activision Blizzard,

94
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,459
karma is...a very nasty lady.

95
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,730
Someone suggested on Reddit that it would
be a shame

96
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,970
if a character from the popular Blizzard game
Overwatch

97
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,030
became the new symbol of the Hong Kong protests.

98
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,820
Yeah, that would be a real shame if that happened.

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,840
And now on to China’s public enemy number
4.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Apple.

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,210
Hong Kong protesters came up with

102
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,810
a crowd sourced app called HK Map Live

103
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,599
that shows in real time the location of Hong
Kong police.

104
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:20,900
It also lets people know where

105
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,919
there’s case of live fire and tear gas.

106
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,830
The Chinese regime demanded that Apple

107
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,229
remove what they call “toxic software”—

108
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,229
Makes sense.

109
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,259
For the Chinese regime,

110
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,520
factual information is very toxic.

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,820
What did Apple do?

112
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,979
They removed the app.

113
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,789
As well as the app of online media Quartz,

114
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,060
which has been reporting a lot on the Hong
Kong protests.

115
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,199
And..the latest update to the iPhone censored

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,780
the Taiwan flag emoji in Hong Kong and Macau.

117
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,830
Yeah, that’ll stop dissent!

118
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,770
Not like China’s public enemy number 5,
though: Vans!

119
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,430
No, Vans the shoe company.

120
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,271
What, do you think the Chinese Communist Party

121
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:06,530
just goes around getting offended at everything?

122
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,530
Every year,

123
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,150
Vans holds what they call the Custom Culture
competition.

124
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,110
People get to submit their own shoes designs

125
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,029
and the winner of an online vote gets $25,000

126
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,740
and their design manufactured by the brand.

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,800
Well, this year, this was one of the top designs,

128
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,569
with tens of thousands of votes.

129
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,150
A Hong Kong protest shoe.

130
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,360
I would buy that.

131
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,190
Except before the contest was over,

132
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,190
Vans announced,

133
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,349
in a Chinese and English statement on facebook,

134
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,110
That “a small number of artistic submissions
have been removed.”

135
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,400
Bet you can’t guess which!

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,999
Honestly, it seems like Vans will let China...walk
all over them.

137
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,979
And once again, in an attempt to appease the
China market,

138
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,919
Vans ends up risking their entire market from
angry fans

139
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,789
who want to boycott them.

140
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,479
But now on to China’ real public enemy—

141
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,400
the Trump Administration.

142
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,800
The Trump Administration has blacklisted 28
Chinese entities

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,949
over abuses in Xinjiang.

144
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,370
Those includes Hikvision and Dahua Technology,

145
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,250
two of the world’s biggest makers of video
surveillance products.

146
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,180
Bet they saw saw that coming.

147
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,629
A day after the blacklist was announced,

148
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,729
the Trump administration put

149
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,309
visa restrictions on Chinese officials

150
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:24,960
involved in abuse of Muslim minorities in
Xinjiang.

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,550
“The State Department said the visa restrictions

152
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,979
will apply to designated Chinese government

153
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,479
and Communist Party officials,

154
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,969
along with their families.”

155
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,139
Yes, the Trump Administration:

156
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,479
Defender of China’s Muslims.

157
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,800
We are in the strangest timeline.

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,180
Obviously, these new punishments by the Trump
Administration

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,050
caused Chinese officials to realize the error
of their ways.

160
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,740
The error being they should retaliate by restricting
visas

161
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,909
for US citizens with anti-China links.

162
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,279
A source speaking to Reuters pointed out that
Beijing

163
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,469
accuses the US and other governments

164
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,870
of inciting “anti-government protests

165
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,249
in both mainland China and Hong Kong.”

166
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,909
A 2 million person protest in Hong Kong?

167
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,900
Totally the CIA’s doing.

168
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,960
So with these new visa restrictions,

169
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,930
China is taking a hard stance against a problem...

170
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,099
they created themselves.

171
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,939
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

172
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,281
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

173
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:21,629
a fan who support China Uncensored

174
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,610
with a dollar or more per episode,

175
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,279
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

176
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,819
James Wallberg asks,

177
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,831
“Do the protesters know about the South
Park episode

178
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,960
denouncing companies following China's lead
on the protests?”

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes they do.

180
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,610
In fact, they’ve held neighborhood screenings

181
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,360
of the South Park episode.

182
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,289
By the way, we just got back to New York

183
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,699
from covering the protests in Hong Kong.

184
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,610
And running away from police shooting tear
gas at us.

185
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,689
So we were not exactly up on the new season
of South Park.

186
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,289
But we heard from you China Uncensored

187
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,479
fans that we needed to watch it.

188
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,740
So when we had some downtime, we did.

189
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,749
Matt, Shelley and I did have a good laugh.

190
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:00,849
Check out the episode if you haven’t already.

191
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,849
It says so many things we’ve been saying
for years.

192
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,440
Only...they got way more attention for it.

193
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,729
Thanks for your question, James.

194
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,729
And if you have a question for me

195
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,550
you want to hear answered on the show,

196
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,619
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,259
by supporting the show with a dollar or more

198
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,550
per episode on Patreon.

199
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,729
YouTube is demonetizing us so much

200
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,509
we would have to shut down the show

201
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,509
if it weren’t for your support.

202
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,419
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

203
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,900
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

204
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,880
See you next time.
