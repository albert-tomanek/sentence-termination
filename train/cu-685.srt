1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,439
China strikes back against the US

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,549
No Trade Deal till 2020?

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,440
And the Chinese Communist Party’s new nemesis
is...

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,140
Batman?!

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,380
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,880
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,150
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,480
...has been sponsored by Surfshark.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,600
Because if you’re interested in the kind
of subversive news we cover,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,529
you’ll want to protect your identity online.

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,989
The United States is really angering Beijing

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,770
with its new approach to China—

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,749
actually standing up for American principles.

15
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:42,469
I know, I never thought our politicians could
do it either.

16
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,600
“The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a bill

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,159
aimed at China's crackdown on its Muslim minority.

18
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,799
The Uighur Act of 2019 calls for the closure
of mass detention camps

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,549
in the province of Xinjiang.

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,469
It would see sanctions imposed on a member

21
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,780
of China's Politburo for the first time.”

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,909
Sanctioning a member of the Politburo is huge.

23
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:04,909
Unprecedented.

24
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,710
“We are sending a message to Beijing.

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,909
America is watching and we will not stand
silent.”

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,049
The Uighurs are an ethnic group that lives
here,

27
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,560
in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,539
For more on how “autonomous” the Chinese
Communist Party

29
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,399
lets the Uighurs be,

30
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,810
here’s Republican Congressman Chris Smith.

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,640
“Children ripped from the warm embrace of
their families

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,850
to be indoctrinated in Communist ideology

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,299
and forced to renounce their religious culture
and language.

34
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,100
Rape, sexual abuse and forced abortions of
women

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,130
being held in internment camps.

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,329
Forced labor on a scale that allows Chinese
companies

37
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,060
to profit from modern-day slavery.”

38
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,479
You know, that’s almost heartwarming.

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,859
Not the rape and modern-day slavery.

40
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:53,979
That’s terrible.

41
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,890
I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans
working together.

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,900
The Chinese Communist Party:

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,780
It brings America together.

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,119
The US Senate has passed a similar bill,

45
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,630
but now they have to vote again on the House
version,

46
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,320
before it goes to President Trump to sign.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,940
This Uighur Human Rights Policy Act comes
shortly

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,350
after Congress pretty much unanimously passed

49
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,040
the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,450
and the PROTECT Hong Kong Act.

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,200
And President Trump signed those into law
last week,

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,580
in spite of Beijing’s objections.

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,980
After the media freaked out that he might
not sign the bills.

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,510
And then freaked out when he did sign the
bills.

55
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,030
But even if the media coverage is a bit haywire,

56
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,070
the important thing is that the House of Representatives,

57
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,050
the Senate, and the White House all agree
on standing up

58
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,940
for freedom and democracy

59
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,200
and calling out China’s human rights issues.

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,790
As you can imagine, the Chinese Communist
Party

61
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,230
is not happy about all this unity

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,530
and talk of freedom and democracy.

63
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,720
They’ve worked so hard for years

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,580
to keep other countries from criticizing them!

65
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,900
Why isn’t it working anymore?!

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,950
And so the empire strikes back.

67
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,680
The Chinese empire strikes back.

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,860
“Beijing on Wednesday furiously condemned

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,840
a piece of American legislation calling for
a tougher U.S. response

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,590
to China's treatment of Muslim minorities.

71
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,550
A foreign ministry spokeswoman warned the
bill could impact

72
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,070
prospects for a deal ending a grueling trade
war.”

73
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,900
“Do you believe that if the U.S. takes measures
to hurt China's interests,

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,020
we will just sit back and let it happen?

75
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,160
I think for every erroneous action,

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
an appropriate price must be paid.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,110
An appropriate price must be paid.”

78
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,650
Oh my gosh!

79
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,330
What are they going to do?!?!

80
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,500
“Several sources familiar with Beijing's
stance told Reuters

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,630
that the bill could jeopardize the so-called
phase one deal

82
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,460
already fraught with disagreements and complications.”

83
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,720
Ohhh, noooo.

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,990
It could jeopardize the trade deal.

85
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,340
How could things possibly get worse?

86
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,330
Oh geez, they suspended US port calls?

87
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,230
What a nightmare!

88
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,500
Anything else?

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
What?

90
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,860
They’re sanctioning American nonprofit groups?

91
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Nooooo!

92
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,400
I’m sorry folks, but the US can’t stand
up

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,760
for human rights and democracy anymore.

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,160
The price is just too high.

95
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
“But the trade war,” you say.

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,260
Well, let’s see what’s going on there.

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,140
It hasn’t been great for China’s economy.

98
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,120
Capital investment by Chinese firms

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,380
saw its lowest growth in three years.

100
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,960
According to a Reuters analysis,

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,160
that’s because “a weakening economy,

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
tight credit and prolonged trade war with
the United States

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,440
dent sales growth and cash reserves.”

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,260
So the longer the trade war goes on,

105
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,910
the more it hurts the Chinese economy.

106
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,820
And now, Trump says he may have to

107
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,600
keep it going till after the US presidential
election next year.

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,470
Meanwhile, more mid-sized American companies
are moving out of China.

109
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,820
Now that doesn’t mean they’re coming back
to America.

110
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,510
Some are considering that,

111
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,850
but a lot of other ones are just diversifying

112
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,680
their supply chains to other Asian countries.

113
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,440
So you might be seeing fewer made in China
products

114
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,910
and more made in Vietnam.

115
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,380
Good old freedom loving communist Vietnam.

116
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,340
But there is one business that’s apparently
booming in China.

117
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,730
This is Yiwu city in Zhejiang province.

118
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,350
I’ve talked about the city before,

119
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,850
on a Christmas episode,

120
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,630
The Chinese city that makes your Christmas.

121
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,510
They manufacture everything.

122
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,150
Loads of Christmas items sure,

123
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,820
but also most of the flags in the world.

124
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,630
Not just country flags, but political slogan
flags.

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,370
And they’re predicting Trump will be reelected.

126
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,840
See, in 2016, five months before the last
presidential election,

127
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,310
the people of Yiwu noticed more people were
ordering Trump flags than Clinton flags.

128
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,030
And so they predicted that Trump would win.

129
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,680
Yes, a tiny Chinese manufacturing city was
more accurate

130
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,590
at predicting election results than the New
York Times.

131
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,639
Of course the 2020 election is still a ways
out.

132
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,740
Maybe 5 months before the election,

133
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,500
the good people of Yiwu might notice people

134
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,510
ordering a very different flag.

135
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,060
But while relations between China and the
US may be strained,

136
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,440
relations between China and Russia are doing
great!

137
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,430
They’ve just opened a natural gas pipeline

138
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,040
linking Siberia to northeastern China.

139
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,620
It’s the biggest energy project for Russia

140
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,120
since the fall of the Soviet Union.

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,820
How nice for them.

142
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,480
This is part of what the Chinese Communist
Party

143
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,010
is calling the Polar Silk Road.

144
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,150
China wants a slice of the shipping lanes

145
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,169
and natural resources of the Arctic.

146
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,620
The US Geological Survey estimates the Arctic
holds

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,480
about 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil
reserves

148
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,389
and 30% of the natural gas reserves.

149
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,200
The northernmost part of China

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,860
is still almost 1000 miles from the Arctic
Circle.

151
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,490
But don’t worry, China is still labeling
itself a “near Arctic state.”

152
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,930
And that means our new cold war

153
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,560
can happen in a place that’s actually cold.

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,610
Speaking of frosty relationships,

155
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,150
the Chinese telecom giant Huawei is in trouble.

156
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,560
And for once, not with the US—

157
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,470
but actually inside China.

158
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,840
Apparently, there’s been a huge social media
backlash

159
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,510
inside China against the company.

160
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,449
Which is bad because the Chinese government

161
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,350
has been trying to make Huawei a rallying
point for patriotism.

162
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,540
Except, “New details came to light in the
case of a former employee

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,750
who was arrested and jailed for 251 days

164
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,840
following an unproven accusation of blackmail
from the company.”

165
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,220
Yeah, that’s not a good look.

166
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,340
According to the New York Times,

167
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,600
“Many Chinese proudly abandoned their iPhones
for Huawei phones.

168
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,440
But the backlash to the jailing of a longtime
employee

169
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,050
after a labor dispute has made it clear that
people in China

170
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,820
are starting to sour on the company.”

171
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,930
And Huawei is getting on the wrong side of
the US, too.

172
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,949
According to the US Commerce Secretary,

173
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,750
Huawei is trying to convince its suppliers

174
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,430
to break the law by moving offshore.

175
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,530
Huawei is on a US trade black list over national
security concerns.

176
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,700
But it’s hard to enforce that on overseas
suppliers.

177
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,419
So Huawei is trying to convince American suppliers

178
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,120
to get around US national security concerns
by going overseas.

179
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,330
So, I’m in the market for a new phone.

180
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,520
But there’s no way I’ll do Huawei.

181
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,479
I would just like to remind everyone that
the China-Pakistan friendship is unbreakable.

182
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,399
Also, more than 600 Pakistani girls were sex
trafficked to Chinese men.

183
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,639
But don’t worry, that’s going to stop.

184
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,219
Not the sex trafficking.

185
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,510
That will continue.

186
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,910
The investigation into the sex trafficking,
that will stop.

187
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,040
According to AP, “Officials with knowledge
of the investigations

188
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,339
say that is because of pressure from government
officials

189
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,300
fearful of hurting Pakistan’s lucrative
ties to Beijing.”

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,749
So you see, when the US State Department labeled
China

191
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,329
as one of the worst human trafficking offenders,

192
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,800
they got it all wrong.

193
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,420
China is the best human trafficking offender.

194
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,899
Speaking of unbridled disasters,

195
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,769
remember that Chinese scientist who genetically

196
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,920
engineered actual human babies?

197
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,250
He edited a gene to make the twins immune
to HIV.

198
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,180
Too bad he couldn’t make himself immune
to public backlash and house arrest.

199
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,309
Speaking of not actually being immune, the
twins.

200
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:33,570
Turns out, the twin girls are probably not
immune to HIV.

201
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,759
That was a lie.

202
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,100
But they may have unintended mutations!

203
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,330
And finally, Batman has run afoul of Chinese
censors.

204
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,879
Frank Miller’s new graphic novel The Dark
Knight Returns: The Golden Child

205
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,480
uses this image of a young Batman throwing
a molotov cocktail.

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,970
But my favorite state-run media the Global
Times

207
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,129
helped set off a firestorm of criticism in
China

208
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,819
by saying it was a reference to Hong Kong
protests.

209
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,679
Or riots as they call it.

210
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,010
After the backlash, DC Comics showed

211
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,179
that it knows a thing or two about heroes...

212
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,089
and how not to act like one.

213
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,060
They quickly removed the image.

214
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,319
Which led, I’m happy to say, to more backlash
against DC.

215
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,149
And that does it for this week’s China News
headlines.

216
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,309

220
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,339
When you go online,

221
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,370
everything you do is being tracked and logged—

222
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,759
by the websites you visit and your internet
service provider.

223
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,899
And in many cases, by the government.

224
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,999
Especially if you're in a place like Xinjiang
or Hong Kong,

225
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,720
this kind of tracking can put you at risk
of surveillance and even arrest.

226
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,750
That's why you should use a VPN like Surfshark
to protect your identity.
