1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,440
China has a plan

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,150
To conquer the high seas

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,620
Can the US stop it before itâ€™s too late?

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,139
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,610
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,689
Joining me today is Captain Jim Fanell,

7
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:21,160
the former Director of Intelligence and Information
Operations

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,650
for the U.S. Pacific Fleet,

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,849
that's the U.S. Navy.

10
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,320
Thanks for joining me today.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,830
Thanks Chris, happy to be here.

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,450
So China is talking about these blue economic
passages

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,060
and according to Chinese state run media,

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,860
these are harmless ocean trade routes

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,930
that will connect Oceania and Africa and Europe.

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,310
So is that really true?

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,330
Are they harmless?

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,960
It sounds really benign,

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,040
but I think it's not just economic development
of extension

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,220
into the maritime domain of their belt and
road initiative.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,150
I think it's part of a larger strategy that
China has

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,080
for returning China to what they believe is
their rightful role

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,250
and place in the world,

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,850
their great rejuvenation in the achievement
of the China dream.

25
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,070
So are we talking imperial ambitions here?

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
It kind of...

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,990
To say that it comes across as conspiracy
theory,

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,690
but it certainly seems like that's the seeds

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,330
of what they're sowing today

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,690
and they'd been working on for the last few
years,

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,690
at least in the South Pacific.

32
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,470
Well, I know you were recently in the South
Pacific.

33
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,290
What did you see there?

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,000
What we saw was we went to Kiribati

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,720
and the Solomon Islands and Bougainville,

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,090
and what we saw was in at least those first
two countries,

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,110
their governments had switched recognition
from Taipei to Beijing,

38
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,110
diplomatic recognition.

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,920
These are tiny island nations.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,030
They're atoll nations in the Melanesian

41
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,350
and Polynesian and Micronesian area of the
South Pacific

42
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,450
and they've switched their recognition

43
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,660
right after the Chinese apparently have paid
off

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,320
a few of their members of parliament and bribed
some people

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,380
and attempted to bribe others,

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,380
and so it seemed,

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,720
and then come in with a big infrastructure
packages

48
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,500
and purchases to try to essentially tell the
locals in these areas

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,260
if you align with us, you'll make yourselves
rich.

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,270
So what did you see on the ground in places

51
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,270
like the Solomon Islands or Kiribas,

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,840
how are the people reacting to this

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,510
Uniformly, the people in Kiribas and in the
Solomon Islands,

54
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,290
the sense that we got was that they felt like
they had been

55
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,750
betrayed by their governments, not consulted.

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,740
We talked to one dear lady in Tulagi who,
in that society,

57
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,390
that Metro-lineal ownership of the land.

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,349
So she was a landowner and a very nice woman
and she said,

59
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,030
"We were betrayed.

60
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,450
We weren't consulted.

61
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,250
This is not a decision that we agree with."

62
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,200
And we heard the same things in Guata Canal

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,580
and in some of the parts of care boss Bougainville

64
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,600
hasn't gotten to that quite step yet.

65
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,170
But clearly their sentiments were in terms
of principles

66
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,459
and the things that they believe in,

67
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,489
they're more aligned to our way of thinking

68
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,880
in the Western democracies

69
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,790
than they are with, they said,

70
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,790
"We're not communists.

71
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,100
We don't like communism,

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,000
but if they offered us money,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,910
and nobody else offers us anything,

74
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,500
then that's what we're going to have to do."

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,450
But in terms of Kiribas in the Solomons,

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,650
it was very clear that they felt like these
people

77
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,870
had taken these bags of money in the middle
of the night

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,390
and then changed the vote.

79
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,730
And now I even heard this morning

80
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,180
from a contact in the Solomon's

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,420
that there's a little bit of buyer's remorse
going on.

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
Really?

83
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
Yeah.

84
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
So-

85
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,420
That happened fast.

86
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Yeah.

87
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,870
Because there was talk before these agreements
that,

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,940
"Oh man, once the Chinese come in, we're all
going to,

89
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
check your bank account.

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,260
It's going to, you're going to have

91
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,780
thousands in there in your bank account."

92
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,239
And it really hasn't materialized yet.

93
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,090
Well I see how that's a problem for Taiwan,

94
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,680
but is that really bad?

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
China's giving these places,

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,340
that are very poor, all this economic developments.

97
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,800
How do you argue against that?

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,861
Well, on the face of it,

99
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,470
it wouldn't seem bad and it's actually

100
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,480
for some of the local nations,

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,050
if nobody else is going to help them,

102
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,959
then why not accept these kind of offers?

103
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,359
Because they're some of the places are in
destitute poverty,

104
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,419
but the concern that we should have is that
these islands

105
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,400
in their strategic geographic location present

106
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,939
the same kind of challenge that we saw 80
years ago

107
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:32,430
when Japan took all these islands through
military force.

108
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,570
So China is using a different model right
now,

109
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,039
which is to come in with soft power

110
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,089
and economic power and diplomatic power.

111
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,050
You know, part of it is designed to isolate
Taiwan,

112
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,839
but part of it is to extend this,

113
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,360
essentially what I called an iron bar,

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,539
through the South Pacific and it would essentially

115
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,830
separate Australia and New Zealand from the
rest of the world.

116
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,949
Now, as an American maybe some people would
say,

117
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,449
what do we care if Australia and New Zealand
are isolated?

118
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,160
How would we get our Vegemite?

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Exactly.

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,819
And kangaroos, how will we see kangaroos?

121
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,020
So there's an issue there,

122
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,699
but there's a larger strategic issue which
is to say that

123
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,830
in the event of a crisis or a concern that
America

124
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,970
would have in the region,

125
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,139
we would need to have some kind of basing
for military forces

126
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,770
like we did in World War II, and Australia
and New Zealand

127
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,749
present that as an option for us.

128
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,210
So from a purely military standpoint,

129
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,289
having Australia and New Zealand cut off makes
it much harder for us

130
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,839
to deal with defending Taiwan or defending
Japan from Chinese aggression

131
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,629
in a large scale conflict.

132
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,869
So China is essentially extending its control
of the Pacific region?

133
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:44,580
Yeah this is cementing their position in,

134
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,150
but if they are able to establish these line
of islands

135
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,389
that are aligned to them diplomatically

136
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,860
and then in the future allow them to bring
in military forces.

137
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,810
So you think military is what comes next?

138
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,810
Not the next step.

139
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,539
I mean, I think the next step is you're going
to see

140
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,469
much more presence of their fishing fleet

141
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,360
because China needs to feed their population,

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,219
and this waters of the five degrees North,

143
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:10,740
five degrees South of the equator is called
the tuna belt.

144
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,009
There's a lot of tuna there that helps feed
people,

145
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,379
and these are prime waters.

146
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,509
These small island nations can't control their
exclusive economic zones

147
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,050
because they just don't have large navies,

148
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,649
they don't have satellites and things to know
who's in their water poaching.

149
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,729
So I think the Chinese will,

150
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:28,970
when they come in with their fishing fleets,

151
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,360
they will also bring their state oceanic administration

152
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
and the Chinese Coast Guard

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,460
and the people's armed forces, maritime militia.

154
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,150
This will all be brought in together and part
of the package will be,

155
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,520
we'll help you surveil your EEZ

156
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,149
to make sure that other countries aren't poaching.

157
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,699
Which, it'll be a smooth way they do that,

158
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,800
but that once they start information sharing
with these nations

159
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,839
it will be another layer of entrenchment.

160
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,059
So it seems like in the very near terms,

161
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,749
it's actually going to hurt the people of
these Island nations

162
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:05,460
because they're going to be short of fish.

163
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,650
I think what'll happen is,

164
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,469
is that China will be smart about it

165
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,689
and they'll probably help them build fish
canneries,

166
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,309
ports, and things of that nature,

167
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,460
and they'll probably give them a slice of
the profit,

168
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
or in some sense.

169
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,270
So there'll probably be a boost initially
in money,

170
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,770
but it won't be the full amount of the resources
that these nations,

171
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,690
if they could develop themselves in a free
and open,

172
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,919
and transparent commercial opportunity,

173
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
could reap in the long term.

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,270
So at what point do you think the Chinese
Navy would get involved?

175
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,009
Well, we've already seen reports that Chinese
Naval vessels

176
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,930
making trips down to Australia and New Zealand.

177
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,259
We've had reports in the last couple of years
of Chinese

178
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,860
long range aircraft flying out of the South
of China,

179
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,900
Southern China into the Philippines

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,929
and refueling and then going on down to New
Zealand.

181
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:01,869
So, I'm not saying that there's going to be
military aircraft

182
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:05,289
flying in and out of Guadalcanal and Honiara,

183
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,879
and things of that nature in the next couple
of years,

184
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,789
but the idea is that they're setting the seeds

185
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,039
for these infrastructure projects

186
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,240
that would allow them to build ports.

187
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,129
And if they do like they did in Vanuatu,

188
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,029
they built this 800 a meter long pier for
a small country

189
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,699
that didn't really need it,

190
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,699
well what could go in there?

191
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,969
And as I think 60 Minutes Australia reported
last year, y

192
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,569
ou could put a Chinese aircraft carrier in
there, easily.

193
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,490
So China is trying to develop its own blue
ocean capabilities?

194
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,240
Well they have been developing

195
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,470
their own blue water ocean capabilities

196
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,729
for the last decade,

197
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,919
and this is just another place where it can
be expanded into.

198
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,080
So I know some people would say,

199
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,950
what's the difference between the U.S. Navy
ruling the oceans

200
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,790
versus the Chinese Navy ruling the ocean?

201
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,290
What would you say that?

202
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,860
I would say that our Navy doesn't bully and
harass people

203
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,190
and take their islands,

204
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,950
their territory in their exclusive economic
zone,

205
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,940
like China did with Scarborough Shoal in 2012,

206
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,450
or build seven islands down in the Spratly
Islands

207
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,790
and inside the exclusive economic zone in
Malaysia,

208
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,550
the Philippines and Vietnam.

209
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,200
There's been reports that Chinese actors in
South Luconia Shoal

210
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,830
blowing up things and taking their markers
that say

211
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,130
this is a Malaysian atoll and blowing it up

212
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,580
so then they can put in a Chinese flag.

213
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,090
So those are just random examples,

214
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,510
there's other examples where the Chinese are
challenging people,

215
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,770
military ships, in the Taiwan Strait

216
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,300
saying you can't travel through the Taiwan
Strait.

217
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,940
Everyone in the world knows that's an international
passage,

218
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,150
yet China wants to say that you can't go through
there

219
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,970
unless you ask my permission.

220
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,400
So that kind of attitude in their response
to the international court

221
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,900
or the permanent court of arbitration case
in 2016

222
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,690
where they said this is a farce

223
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,950
and we're not going to follow the court's
ruling.

224
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,750
These are all signals of an attitude that
says,

225
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,450
we get to do whatever we want.

226
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,590
And then let me just add one more,

227
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,910
we also have these cases of U.S. and other
aircraft

228
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,621
being lased out in Djibouti and in the East
and South China sea

229
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:19,200
by Chinese vessels, Chinese forces.

230
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Lased as like-

231
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Shining a laser in a pilot's eyes,

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
there's only one reason you'd do that,

233
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
to blind the guy and then he crashes and dies.

234
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,840
So it's a very serious provocation

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,690
and we kind of haven't held them accountable
for that.

236
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,090
So how much of a concern is this actually

237
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,200
because can the Chinese Navy really rival
the United States?

238
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,780
Well as I've said in other forums,

239
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,660
I think the Chinese Navy does rival the U.S.
Navy

240
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,560
inside the Asia Pacific,

241
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,630
inside the second island chain in terms of
the number of platforms

242
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,110
that they have that can shoot missiles to
sink our fleet,

243
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,200
anti-ship cruise missiles from the surface
ships,

244
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,760
from their submarines, from their aircraft,
land-based cruise missiles,

245
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,910
land-based ballistic missiles that are designed
to kill carriers

246
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,070
like the DF-21 and DF-26.

247
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,550
So, China's built a layered defensive capability

248
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:21,050
to keep the U.S. Military at arms length from
the Taiwan contingency,

249
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,009
the Senkaku's contingency,

250
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,340
and any contingency in the South China Sea.

251
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,160
I think what we're going to see over the next
decade

252
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,850
is them extend that counter intervention strategy

253
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,700
beyond the second island chain,

254
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,840
so to really keep American forces from even

255
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,960
getting from Hawaii into the Guam area.

256
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,100
Also, what would that mean for the world if
the U.S.

257
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,010
is denied access to basically the entire Western
Pacific?

258
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,060
Well, it would be denied in a conflict,

259
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,920
on a daily basis wouldn't mean anything initially.

260
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,150
But in the event of a conflict where China
said,

261
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,500
we're tired of America or we don't like what
they did with Hong Kong,

262
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,900
the Act that the Congress passed and the President
signed

263
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,930
where they say that's unacceptable and we're
going to show you,

264
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,420
they could block off something or they could
isolate something

265
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,790
or they can conduct a quarantine or a blockade
of some place

266
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,540
and essentially starve somebody out if they
wanted to.

267
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,570
And we'd be hard pressed to break that without
escalating the situation,

268
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,350
so they could use it as a ratcheting up technique.

269
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,880
A part of the salami slicing strategy that
we haven't really seen.

270
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,280
We've seen them incrementally inch forward
in geographic areas,

271
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,220
in statements and postures, but we haven't
actually seen them

272
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,950
do it in a more militaristic way.

273
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,140
I know these blue economic passages,

274
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,620
it's not just in the South Pacific,

275
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,071
it's also going up to the Arctic,

276
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,100
it's going to Europe, to Africa.

277
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,330
What's happening in those other branches of
this?

278
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,330
Well we're seeing,

279
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,760
I mean they've really been focused.

280
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,600
The first one was from the South China sea
into the Indian ocean

281
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,690
and then up into the Mediterranean and in
the Baltic.

282
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,610
I was up on a ship in the Baltic,

283
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,990
a Chinese ship that routinely sends ships
up there,

284
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,360
exercise with the Russians up there.

285
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,030
So they've made inroads into Europe,

286
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,190
OCEA has been meeting with the French and
the Italians

287
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,480
and they've signed some agreements for the
belt and road initiative,

288
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,470
ports in Genoa and ports in Trieste.

289
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,450
I expect to see more ports in France

290
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,940
come under some kind of an agreement.

291
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,860
I wouldn't be surprised if that would happen.

292
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,510
You have the base in Djibouti.

293
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,940
Remember for years they said,

294
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,150
we don't have it, we're never going to have

295
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,850
any overseas military bases.

296
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,990
I mean you can pull out,

297
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,730
reams and reams of analysis from think tanks
in this town

298
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,960
that said that would never happen, and yet
there it sits.

299
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,380
So what else are we seeing that they're doing
on the West Coast of Africa,

300
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,430
down on the East Coast of South America,

301
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,500
in Argentina and Brazil.

302
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,790
Where else are they expanding so that they
can have

303
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,200
the presence to be able to operate?

304
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,780
I think it's coming and we've just been reluctant
to predict the future,

305
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,180
even though they tell us what it is.

306
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,450
Yeah, I was thinking that a lot of the things

307
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,000
the Chinese Communist Party is doing in like
the Solomon Islands,

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,620
it sounds very similar to Mauritania in Western
Africa.

309
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,250
Same fishing things, same...

310
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,240
It's a model, they have a model and it seems
to be pretty effective.

311
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,010
So what does all this mean for your average
American?

312
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,529
Well, what it means is that, at the end of
the day,

313
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,700
if you don't address this in another 20 years,
30 years,

314
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,560
by 2049 China will have established a system
of governance

315
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,810
that will allow Beijing and the Chinese Communist
Party

316
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,410
to control the levers of power.

317
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,500
And what it will mean in real terms is instead
of having

318
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,520
the market dictate how many iPhones we make

319
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,320
or how many cars we build or how many jackets
we buy

320
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,250
or how many shoes we have made,

321
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,850
you're going to have some bureaucrat in Beijing

322
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,690
doing a scientific development process on
his abacus telling us,

323
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,470
okay, this is the goal.

324
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,180
We need to produce this many of these and
this many of these

325
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
and this many of these.

326
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,020
And then there's another segment of the government

327
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,180
that's reviewing the people in other places
and saying,

328
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,770
Oh, that guy he forgot to do this, and he
didn't do that.

329
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,690
So we're going to lower his score and he can't
travel anymore.

330
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,070
Or his kid can't get into this university,

331
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,770
or he can't get this kind of goat cheese at
this store

332
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,970
because he's had too much in the last three
months.

333
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,780
So this is the kind of world that, it sounds
crazy,

334
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,600
but this is the way they want to control things.

335
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,020
The social credit system.

336
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,270
The social credit system.

337
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,180
I mean you can just imagine that being exported

338
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,990
even though they deny that they want to export
it.

339
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,960
It seems pretty clear that if you're going
to expand your belt and road

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,770
and have all this control everywhere,

341
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,370
that you're not going to, your system can't
work.

342
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,190
You know, they talk about they're pushing
forward into AI and big data.

343
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,080
They want all of this data to come in.

344
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,170
Well what for?

345
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,670
If it's only for market forces?

346
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,670
No, it's going to be more than that.

347
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,430
So what can the U.S. do about this?

348
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,830
Well, we first have to do,

349
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,080
what I think this administration has done
is recognize

350
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,130
that China is a strategic competitor.

351
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,310
So we've said that the national security strategy

352
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,070
and the national defense strategy

353
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,540
and now we're starting to have our senior
leaders

354
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,230
talk about the difference between the United
States and China

355
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,810
and PRC in terms of their values

356
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,440
and in what we stand for in individual liberty
and freedom.

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party

358
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,940
stands for the Chinese Communist Party.

359
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,630
And so they are the be all end all of everything

360
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,779
and we need to tell the world that there's
a choice there.

361
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,880
Now I know that the administration, some people
have said,

362
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,670
well we're not asking people to make choices
between U.S.

363
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,980
and the PRC.

364
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,720
And that's a fine thing.

365
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,880
I think what we're doing is saying

366
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,050
you have to decide about the values, though.

367
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,110
Who you want to be associated with.

368
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,690
And I think that we have a long track record
in human history

369
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:09,169
that our system of freedom is more attractive

370
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,519
and more appealing to people innately.

371
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,220
And it's gives people a better opportunity

372
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,059
to have a higher quality of life and more
satisfaction.

373
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,209
That message needs to be continued.

374
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,459
On a defense, security standpoint,

375
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,279
we need to retool our military to move it
away from

376
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,529
a focus on the middle East

377
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,980
to a focus on being able to keep the sea lanes
open

378
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,779
and trade in economies going.

379
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:39,039
So as much as people say the administration
is isolationist,

380
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,340
I don't see that because they say they want
to build up the Navy.

381
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,080
In Simi Valley yesterday or the day before,

382
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,240
the new National Security Advisor, O'Brien,

383
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,690
talked about the administration's commitment

384
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,480
to getting to a 350 ship Navy, not in decades,
but sooner than that.

385
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,649
So there's a desire by the administration
to build up the Navy.

386
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,290
And there's only one reason for that.

387
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,249
And the reason that we want a big Navy is
to ensure that

388
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,619
the Chinese or then the Russians and the Soviet
Navy

389
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,399
don't control these things

390
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:14,909
and put a damper on international trade between
these nations.

391
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:16,720
So I think we're on the right track.

392
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
I just think it's really hard to move the
ship of state.

393
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,419
And we have a lot of commitments globally.

394
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,730
And we've had a mindset since Desert Storm,
since 1991,

395
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,730
that has said the Middle East is an existential
threat.

396
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,399
And I think that things in the middle East
are dangerous.

397
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:37,399
But I, I think that after 30 years and the
infrastructure

398
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,529
that we've established with the Homeland Security

399
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,950
and other places that allowed us to say, okay,

400
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,619
we've got, we've got a handle on the Middle
East

401
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,700
and terrorism much better than we did before
9-11,

402
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,380
but what we don't have a handle on right now

403
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,710
is competing and being able to deter Chinese
aggression

404
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,929
in the Indo pay comm arena.

405
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,970
And I'm concerned that if we don't address
it now,

406
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,650
we won't be able to address it when it concerns

407
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,840
the Mediterranean or the South Atlantic.

408
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,970
Well, so what happens in the next five or
10 years

409
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,629
after this administration?

410
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:16,429
Well, this is American domestic politics.

411
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,240
I mean, you need sustainment of this view
of,

412
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,519
if you buy into this,

413
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,380
and I mean I recognize that many people may
not,

414
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,820
but I think a lot of, obviously the administration
does,

415
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,669
and there seems to be, you hear reports about
bipartisan agreement

416
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,820
on things like the Hong Kong act and,

417
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,960
and other things like that-

418
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
The Uyghur Bill.

419
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
The Uyghur Bill.

420
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Yeah, exactly.

421
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,299
So we need to capitalize on this emerging

422
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,869
bi-partisan efforts towards China

423
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,090
and it needs to be sustained.

424
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,929
So you say a lot of these island nations,

425
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:55,289
they share the same values as the United States,

426
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,799
but I mean, as you say, values don't pay the
bills.

427
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,119
What can be done on the ground?

428
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,489
So I think the administration is moving out
in certain areas

429
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:12,090
and trying to incentivize our commercial interests

430
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,990
to help in these areas.

431
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,049
And they've got a number of things that they're
working on.

432
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,510
But from my perspective, this is a big issue.

433
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,129
And all these islands have similar problems

434
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:29,179
in terms of infrastructure and being able
to monitor their EEZ's

435
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,129
and to reap the harvest of the resources that
they have,

436
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:36,840
whether in the water or on their islands and
they need help.

437
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,179
And what the United States should do with,

438
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,739
I think for other nations, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan,

439
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,950
is to band together and develop some kind
of what

440
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,410
I would term a Marshall plan, find some person...

441
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,070
I don't know if it's preferably a military
person,

442
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,519
but maybe you need somebody that's going to
be able

443
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,379
to lead a large group like this,

444
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,580
but to have these nations come together and
do something

445
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,460
outside of their typical bureaucratic morass

446
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,980
and break above that to say,

447
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,820
"Hey, we're in a kind of a crisis like we
were in world war II

448
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,390
where Germany was devastated.

449
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,159
The Soviets were pressing in and these people
needed food,

450
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,239
they needed sustenance, they needed infrastructure."

451
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,610
And George Marshall, the general of the army
developed a plan

452
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,690
to come in and help rescue them.

453
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,610
And some of it was we brought in our own stuff
and our own food

454
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,629
and things of that nature,

455
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,210
but it was also coming in and helping the
German people

456
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,009
just have the ability to rise themselves up
and rebuild Germany.

457
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:39,289
The Germans did that.

458
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:40,289
Okay?

459
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,659
We could do something similar in this area
here,

460
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,460
which would just moving in that direction,

461
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,710
labeling it and moving in that direction

462
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,869
and combining the talents of our five nations.

463
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,640
Maybe the Japanese build harbors,

464
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,600
maybe the Australians take roads,

465
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,629
maybe the U.S. does I.T., Whatever it is.

466
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,970
But something like that where we're all kind
of covering a wedge,

467
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,230
covering an area that then could then show
and demonstrate not only to these,

468
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,899
first to these islands that, Hey, you know,

469
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:15,210
the Western world is really here and they,

470
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,210
they're doing it again.

471
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,299
Like they did 80 years ago,

472
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,100
they're coming to help us and then we need
to train them.

473
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,720
We don't just need to give them fish,

474
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,600
we need to train them to learn how to fish.

475
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,269
And that's nothing new for me.

476
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:28,730
But you've heard that,

477
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,429
and we should be doing that across all these
areas.

478
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,990
And then it also sends a larger signal to
the rest of Asia,

479
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,860
which is to say, Hey, you know,

480
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,190
America said they're committed to the Pacific.

481
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,740
They say they're a Pacific nation,

482
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,289
here they're actually doing something and
it's helping people.

483
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,659
I think this is a way to help answer that
question

484
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,610
about why should I choose the PRC or why should
I choose the U.S.?

485
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,899
Why should I choose the Chinese Communist
Party

486
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,820
or why should I choose freedom?

487
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,080
So, but this is not an easy thing to do.

488
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,239
And the bureaucracies in each of our governments
are very difficult

489
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:06,409
because we have established protocols and
concerns

490
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:08,590
and there's concerns about, well,

491
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,929
we're not going to spend as much money,

492
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,649
dollar for dollar would against China.

493
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:13,350
We're not going to compete in that arena.

494
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,980
And I'm not suggesting that we compete dollar
for dollar.

495
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,580
What I'm suggesting is we compete idea for
idea,

496
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,410
innovation versus some somebody in the Chinese
Communist Party

497
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,690
with a schedule that's figured out, okay,
here's,

498
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,480
here's how we can do this and we're going
to mandate it down to them.

499
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,149
I think we can do this.

500
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,869
We just need to say it's important.

501
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:37,360
So with everything you're saying about China's
global ambitions,

502
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,899
doesn't this come from Xi Jinping?

503
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:41,780
Like he won't be in power forever?

504
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,999
Like maybe after Xi Jinping,

505
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,220
it won't be as much of an issue.

506
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Yeah.

507
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,350
So I think there's a school of thought inside

508
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,700
the China hands community that's focusing
on Xi

509
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,039
and kind of blaming Xi as the cause,

510
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,269
root cause of what's going on right now,

511
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,350
and that the belt and road in this economic
passages

512
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,759
and the militarization of the Chinese

513
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,950
is all because of Xi and what he's doing in
Jin Jiang.

514
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,320
All these things that we track, that you track
and your team.

515
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,080
But my belief is, what I've seen from the
evidence is that,

516
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,549
this blue economic passages, they predate
Xi they go back to...

517
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,720
I saw pictures on Chinese warships from 2012
that depicted

518
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,519
a Dragon's head coming out of the mainland
of China

519
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,869
with three arrows, one to the polar area,

520
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,370
one into the South China Sea into the Indian
Ocean

521
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,369
and one end to the South Pacific.

522
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:40,470
That was on a Chinese worship in Sydney in
2012, okay.

523
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,519
That was to inspire Chinese sailors to be
pumped up about their mission.

524
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,519
Okay.

525
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,890
Well, those pictures were probably developed
in 2011 or 2010 you know,

526
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,720
well before Xi Jinping was in power.

527
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,559
So my belief is that this is part of the long
trajectory

528
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:04,119
that's unbroken since Ziyang, Jiang, Hu, Xi,
and whoever's next,

529
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,840
they're all marching towards to return China

530
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,500
to its rightful place in charge of the world.

531
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,730
So this isn't Xi Jinping.

532
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,419
This is an existential threat of the Chinese
Communist Party?

533
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,419
Correct.

534
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:19,509
Now Xi is chosen to break with past practice

535
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:22,499
of how you expose yourself.

536
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,940
At least the Chinese Communist Party

537
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,360
being exposed for their truer attentions.

538
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,690
So maybe he stepped off too early,

539
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,100
we can debate that,

540
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,909
but clearly he's not the only guy that's doing
this.

541
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,429
And when he goes away,

542
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,230
it's not going to change that trajectory.

543
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,269
There's still going to be intent upon that.

544
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:42,220
So they haven't been deterred is the real
issue.

545
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,160
We've had 40 years of engagement that has
told them, eh,

546
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,259
we're not going to do anything.

547
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,269
So do whatever you want.

548
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:49,239
That's got to change.

549
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,239
All right.

550
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,840
Thank you very much for joining me today.

551
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,080
It's a pleasure to have you on.

552
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,060
Thanks Chris.

553
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,760
Appreciate it.
