00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,970
China, Russia, and Iran

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,040
Are teaming up for Naval Drills

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,190
In the Indian Ocean

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:15,200
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,680
So, President Biden is facing a lot of challenges
in just the first few weeks of his presidency.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,460
The latest—a meeting of the Legion of Doom.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,769
That’s right, Russia, China, and Iran are
holding joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean.

10
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,809
I’m sure India is thrilled.

11
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,679
The naval drills will begin mid-February.

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,679
Wait a minute.

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,679
Mid-February?

14
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,969
I know what this is.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,749
It’s a new holiday.\h

16
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:58,699
Look at the success of Valentines spin-off
holiday Galentine’s Day.\h

17
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,320
So obviously the next step is Villain-tine’s
Day.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,160
When you celebrate with all of your favorite
villains.\h\h

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,690
And their navies.\h

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,040
According to Moscow’s ambassador to Tehran,
“The drills would rehearse search and rescue

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,440
operations and ensuring the safety of shipping.”

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,080
Similar drills were held back in 2019.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,110
Now get this—these new drills were announced
shortly after the only US aircraft carrier

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,210
in the Middle East—the USS Nimitz was ordered
back to the US.

25
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,700
Last year, the Trump Administration had ordered
the Nimitz remain in the area because of heightened

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,070
tensions with Iran.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,110
But according to the New York Times, since
President Biden is looking to renew the Iran

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,570
Nuclear Deal that Trump withdrew from, he
ordered the ship back to its home port in

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,570
Washington.

30
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,050
But the alliance between Russia, Iran, and
China is making the US military pretty nervous.

31
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,690
This week, US Central Command chief Gen. Kenneth
McKenzie gave a keynote speech about the threats

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,050
posed by these powers.

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,220
He said, “The United States faces increasing
competition in the [Middle East] from Russia

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,450
and China both vying for power and influence
through a combination of diplomatic, military

35
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,410
and economic means.”

36
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,990
And China has a particular interest in the
region.

37
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,420
“China is dependent on the region for half
of its crude oil.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,810
China continues to cultivate trade relationships,
economic investment and comprehensive partnerships

39
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,319
among regional states.

40
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,840
China uses its ‘Belt and Road’ initiative
and the China-Pakistan economic corridor to

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,010
expand Chinese influence and presence within
the [region].”

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,080
However, the US is doing its own joint naval
drills, with Australia and Japan, clearly

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,960
aimed at sending a message to China.

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,750
According to a Chinese military analyst, “The
exercise is to ensure the connection between

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,230
the Guam base and other bases, if it comes
under attack from Beijing.”

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,690
That was backed up by a US General, who said,
“China and Russia can increasingly hold

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,630
overseas US bases at risk.

48
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,410
To adapt, the air force must evolve from its
dependence on well-established airfields or

49
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,110
risk building an operational edge.”

50
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,120
But in addition to those drills, it seems
the USS Nimitz (Corner Box) made a little

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,590
detour, and is now joining another US aircraft
carrier for training drills in the South China

52
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,590
Sea.

53
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,160
It’s “the first large-scale "freedom of
navigation" operation aimed at Beijing since

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,940
the start of the Biden presidency.”

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,260
And that “comes just days after the destroyer
USS John S. McCain conducted operations in

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,760
the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, a disputed
archipelago in the region claimed by China,

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,489
Vietnam and Taiwan.”

58
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,000
So things are really heating up in the South
China Sea.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,540
This is going to turn out well.

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,690
And this episode is sponsored by Surfshark.

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,319
When you go online, you should be using a
VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.

62
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,069
Everything you do online is being tracked

63
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,680
your internet service provider.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,100
And in many cases, by the government.

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,090
And if you’re in an authoritarian country
like China, Russia, or Iran—this kind of

66
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,130
tracking can put you at risk of surveillance
and even arrest.

67
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,370
