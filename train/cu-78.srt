1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,920
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,880
everybody's a winner!

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,260
Wait, what's that, Shelley?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,930
Trade Wars.

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,800
That's more than just George Lucas's unproduced
spin-off

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,460
of the Star Wars prequels.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,050
According to the leaked script,

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,780
it follows Jar Jar Binks as he infiltrates
the Trade Federation.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,499
Strange that it never got made.

12
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:28,499


13
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:29,499
Anyway, trade wars.

14
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,730
That's what some experts are afraid might
happen

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,609
if President Trump carries out his promise
to impose a tariff,

16
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,699
or tax, on goods made in China.

17
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:41,059
He blames China’s unfair trade practices

18
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,249
for the loss of American manufacturing jobs.

19
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:45,920
Here today to talk about this issue

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,350
is the only person at China Uncensored

21
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,899
with an economics degree from Trump's own
alma mater,

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,729
University of Pennsylvania, Shelley Zhang.

23
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,850
Thanks, Chris.

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,280
How likely is it that Trump is going to impose
tariffs on China?

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,190
Oh, he's definitely going to do it.

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,190
Really?

27
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,239
100 percent.

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,600
How can you be so sure?

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,740
I'm not sure about anything anymore.

30
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,049
Ok, yes President Trump can be a smidge unpredictable.

31
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,700
But railing against unfair trade practices

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,689
is kind of his jam.

33
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:17,710
In 1987,

34
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,200
he took out this full-page ad in the New York
Times.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
In it,

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,299
he criticized Japan for taking advantage of
the US

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,640
with its weak yen and trade surpluses,

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,320
and suggested that we "tax" Japan and other
countries

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,590
for the services the US provides,

40
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,880
like keeping the world safe.

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Sound familiar?

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,390
I guess China is the new Japan?

43
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,390
Yes.

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,390
Just a quick find and replace,

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,149
and he can still use the same speech

46
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,219
30 years later.

47
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,219
Ok,

48
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,320
so when President Trump imposes tariffs on
China,

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,789
what effect will that have?

50
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,749
Will that start a trade war?

51
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:51,159
That I don't know.

52
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,909
It really depends on how high the tariff is,

53
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,939
and how broadly it's applied.

54
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,139
Trump has talked about wanting to impose a
45% tariff

55
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,229
on all Chinese-made goods.

56
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,509
Something that big would probably trigger
China

57
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,710
to impose its own tariffs on American goods
in retaliation.

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,509
That could lead to a trade war.

59
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,430
Of course, you could argue that China

60
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,349
already started the trade war years ago.

61
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,709
You know, when it did things like

62
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,860
artificially lowering the price of their products

63
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,599
through export subsidies,

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,629
stealing intellectual property,

65
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,540
and setting up ways to keep US companies

66
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,690
from competing in China.

67
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,750
That's definitely how the Trump administration

68
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,750
sees it.

69
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,480
Well, more important than who starts it, is
who finishes it.

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,069
Who wins the US-China trade war?

71
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,980
Experts are divided, Chris.

72
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,150
Some say it will hurt America.

73
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,790
Others say China will lose.

74
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,069
Meanwhile, Chinese state-run media

75
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,140
say that China would totally not get hurt
by a trade war.

76
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,570
And, like, it's not going to happen.

77
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,629
Plus why would the US want a stupid trade
war anyway?

78
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,780
Which means state-run media also think China
will lose.

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,519
So what you're saying is, America wins.

80
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,900
Well, it's complicated.

81
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,659
Americans will lose in that tariffs mean

82
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,840
companies will raise prices on Made in China
stuff.

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,489
So we'll have to pay higher prices on most
stuff at Wal-Mart,

84
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,730
as well as things like appliances and consumer
electronics.

85
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,430
But will tariffs bring American jobs back?

86
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,379
They might bring some jobs back.

87
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,500
But not necessarily the same ones that left.

88
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,959
Jobs might require higher technical skills,
for example.

89
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,550
Low-skill manufacturing jobs

90
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,909
probably aren't going to come back.

91
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,500
Lots of those jobs have been replaced by technology.

92
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,110
And US companies can just move to other Third
World countries

93
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,519
with cheap labor.

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,470
Like the Donald J Trump Signature Collection

95
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,150
has already started moving from China to other
countries.

96
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
Yes.

97
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,660
Although in a recent speech,

98
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,110
Trump said he will incentivize US companies
with tax breaks

99
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,250
and other things to come back to the US.

100
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,560
Tariffs could also create different jobs.

101
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,480
For example, in industries where China has
a virtual monopoly,

102
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,020
like on rare earth minerals,

103
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,480
which are needed to make electronics.

104
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,180
Tariffs could cause a huge shortage in the
short term,

105
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
but in the long term,

106
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,840
it could encourage American companies

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,270
to start mining rare earth minerals.

108
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,830
What about China?

109
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,830
China has more to lose

110
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,549
because they sell us more stuff

111
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:14,969
than we sell them.

112
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,120
And in a trade war,

113
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,230
generally the country with the trade surplus

114
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,940
gets hit the hardest.

115
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,540
China could lose millions of export and manufacturing
jobs.

116
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,610
And at a time when economic growth is slowing,

117
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,130
that could cause not only huge problems with
their economy,

118
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,230
but it could lead to political instability
as well.

119
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,230
After all,

120
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,230
one of the big reasons

121
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,230
people put up with the Communist Party

122
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,700
is economic growth.

123
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,860
Very true.

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,600
And if China loses more,

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,810
does that mean America wins?

126
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,170
It's not so cut and dried.

127
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,470
There are other things that would probably
happen.

128
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,680
Like the cheap manufacturing that's currently
in China

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
would move even faster to places like Southeast
Asia.

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,300
And it might create a gray market

131
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,570
where goods are manufactured in China

132
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,020
but shipped to another country,

133
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,090
where they are officially exported to the
US

134
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,900
to avoid the tariffs.

135
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,700
Are you really saying that people will find
loopholes

136
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,340
to avoid taxes?

137
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,680
Anyway, I guess we'll have to wait and see
what happens.

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,020
Well, we actually have kind of a test case.

139
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,770
What I like to call the Rubber Chicken Skirmish
of 2009.

140
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,240
That's when President Obama set a tariff

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,210
of 35% on Chinese tires.

142
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,770
It did manage to save 1,200 US tire jobs

143
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,940
and increased US tire production.

144
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,530
However, tires also got way more expensive

145
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,280
for US consumers.

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,090
And China raised retaliatory tariffs on chicken
parts

147
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,280
from the US,

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,450
which cost chicken producers about 1 billion
dollars.

149
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,210
I'm glad that wasn't actually about rubber
chickens.

150
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,500
I was starting to worry about you.

151
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,840
Would it help if I told you I didn't sleep
last night?

152
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
No?

153
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
Ok, one thing to note here Chris

154
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,780
is that I have been talking about this tariff
in generalities,

155
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,000
since Trump hasn't talked yet about the specifics

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
of his plan.

157
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,050
However, economist Peter Navarro,

158
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,350
who’s the new director of Trump's National
Trade Council,

159
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,780
has defended the tariff.

160
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,430
He says that it would be applied not on everything,

161
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,520
but with a "flexible case-by-case approach.”

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,990
And that tariffs would be used strategically

163
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,740
to negotiate with China.

164
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Remember,

165
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,580
the Chinese regime is scared to lose manufacturing
jobs—

166
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,690
because it could affect China's political
stability.

167
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,350
That means the threat of a trade war

168
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,220
could be a powerful bargaining chip for the
US.

169
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,240
So, if these tariffs are targeted to give
the US

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,280
greater political leverage over China

171
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,220
and expose the ways the Communist Party

172
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,000
has gamed the system,

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,380
they could maybe get the Party

174
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,800
to change some of their trade practices.

175
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,910
And that would make the tariffs successful,

176
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,380
even if they don't bring back millions of
manufacturing jobs.

177
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,150
So what you're saying is, America wins.

178
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,210
Trade isn't exactly a zero sum game, Chris,
and...

179
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,060
Ok, you know what, yes, America wins.

180
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,460
Thanks, Shelley.

181
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,270
