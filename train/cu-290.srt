1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,880
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,900
It’s time for the blame game.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,740
Hi.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,740
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,639
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,000
The US-China trade conflict has been heating
up in July—

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,840
like a New York City apartment without an
air conditioner.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,890
I would know.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,550
President Trump put tariffs on

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,670
34 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,100
And the Chinese Communist Party retaliated,

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,250
by doing the same to American goods.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,510
Why the tariffs in the first place?

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,739
As US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer
put it,

15
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,280
the tariffs are “proportionate and responsive

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
to forced technology transfer

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,440
and intellectual property theft by the Chinese.”

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
In other words,

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,890
the Chinese regime was cheating,

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,269
and the tariffs aim to balance that out.

21
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,489
It’s like a golf handicap.

22
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,219
Except instead of taking a handicap

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,730
because your opponent is better at golf,

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,159
you do it because your opponent cheats at
golf.

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,159
And anyway,

26
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,539
with the Chinese regime putting its own tariffs
on American goods...

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,090
that kind of defeats the purpose of the US
tariffs, right?

28
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,170
Well don’t worry, because Trump has threatened
even more US tariffs.

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,270
They would tax imports on a whopping 200 billion
dollars of Chinese goods.

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,240
Which is smart when you think about it, because
China doesn’t even buy

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,920
200 billion dollars worth of American goods
in a year.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,890
So in order for China to retaliate with equal
tariffs,

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,719
they’d actually have to buy more American
goods than ever before.

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,820
It’s a foolproof plan.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,859
Of course, there are other ways the Chinese
regime could retaliate.

36
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,469
No, no, no.

37
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,859
They know that can’t win that kind of war.

38
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,240
So they’ve chose a different tactic:

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,390
Blame the US for being a horrible,

40
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,680
no-good bully.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,249
“They are just a trade bully.

42
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,469
They are hurting the global value chain.”

43
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,750
And you wouldn’t hit a guy with glasses,
right?

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,450
Yes, China is a major victim of trade protectionism,

45
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,140
according to Chinese state-run media.

46
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,920
Don’t worry, though.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,860
Because the trade war is going to hurt the
US more than China,

48
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,110
according to Chinese state-run media.

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,790
I know that makes it sound like the US is
going to be the victim,

50
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,549
and that’s true.... as long as you remember
that China

51
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:26,379
is still actually the biggest victim here,
ok?

52
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,500
Actually, that sounds like a great idea for
a reality TV show.

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,129
The US vs. China: Who is the biggest victim?

54
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,319
Again, remember, it’s China.

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,110
And that’s why Chinese officials announced
on Monday

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,720
that they had filed a complaint to the World
Trade Organization

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,510
against the US over the proposed new tariffs.

58
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,650
Meanwhile, Chinese state media have launched
a campaign

59
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,989
to show the world how China is actually the
country

60
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,140
everyone should do business with.

61
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,670
Multinational firms hail China’s global
role as a trade partner,

62
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,840
according to Chinese state-run media.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,790
And China and the EU agree to support free
trade, hint hint.

64
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,590
Also, according to Chinese state-run media.

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,750
So is China really the best trading partner?

66
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,140
And is the US to blame for starting a trade
war?

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,739
Well, to answer those questions,

68
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,250
let’s take a time machine back to 2001.

69
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,329
A simpler time,

70
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,280
when Harry Potter was still innocent...

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,959
...when the coolest phone you could buy looked
like this...

72
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,950
...and when China was admitted to the World
Trade Organization,

73
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,750
or WTO.

74
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
At the time,

75
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,290
hopes were high that China would embrace our
rules-based system

76
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,689
of international trade.

77
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,260
Chinese authorities promised they would play
fair.

78
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,310
And really, how could you not trust a face
like this?

79
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,790
Just because the Chinese dictator

80
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,209
was throwing Chinese dissidents in jail...

81
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,819
without due process...

82
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,250
and torturing them...

83
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,469
that doesn’t mean he wouldn't respect the
laws

84
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,159
of other nations, right?

85
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,159
And anyway,

86
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,530
Chinese officials at the time totally promised

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,129
not to do unfair stuff—

88
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,969
like forcing foreign companies to turn over
key technologies

89
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:15,780
in exchange for market access.

90
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,250
Or artificially blocking Hollywood movies

91
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,690
from screening in the Chinese market.

92
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,430
Or giving subsidies to factories to help them

93
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,270
outcompete foreign companies.

94
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,700
Or... well, the list goes on.

95
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,670
But this report titled “False Promises:

96
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,600
The Yawning Gap Between China’s WTO Commitments
and Practices,”

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,030
says...well, it’s called “False Promises”,

98
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,090
so what do you expect it to show?

99
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,460
Did China live up to its WTO commitments?

100
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:52,590
Looks like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, and...no.

101
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,850
Ok, but things are getting better, right?

102
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,280
According to the report, also no.

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,060
“If anything, [China’s] aggressive innovation
mercantilism

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,500
has grown stronger in recent years.”

105
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,060
Mercantilism is an aggressive trade policy

106
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,040
of intense government meddling in a nation’s
economy,

107
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,740
with the intention of making that country’s
economy stronger

108
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,750
at the expense of other trading partners.

109
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,260
Mercantilism has fallen out of vogue

110
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,190
over the last several hundred years

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,180
because of its nasty tendency to cause not
just trade wars,

112
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,910
but also actual wars.

113
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,510
This study titled “Economic Nationalism:

114
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,540
From Mercantilism to World War II”

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,650
concludes that “economic nationalism tends
to make peace

116
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,870
more precarious and conflict more likely.”

117
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,870
In fact,

118
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,200
one of the reasons the WTO was set up

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,370
was to give countries a forum

120
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,900
to resolve trade disputes peacefully.

121
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,200
But, as the “False Promises” report says,

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,330
“China has simply failed to fully comply
with

123
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,650
its WTO accession commitments

124
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,820
and membership requirements.

125
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,500
But even worse is the fact that Chinese economic

126
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,210
and trade policies increasingly reject

127
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,930
or undermine the foundational tenets

128
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,210
and principles upon which the WTO,

129
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,610
and indeed, globalization is based.”

130
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,790
Not that multinational firms shouldn’t hail
China’s global role,

131
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,870
according to state media...
it’s just that its global role has been

132
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,870
to undermine

133
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,300
the very rules global trade is based on.

134
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,230
For example, China has been manipulating its
currency

135
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,060
and using export subsidies to run up

136
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,250
a massive global trade surplus.

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,280
Its surplus with the US alone

138
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,230
is hundreds of billions of dollars per year.

139
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,710
By the way, when American politicians pitched
the idea

140
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,280
of China being in the WTO,

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,780
they promised China’s trade surplus would
look

142
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,740
more like this blue line—

143
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,720
where the trade surplus eventually balances
at zero.

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
Boy, did that not happen!

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
The “False Promises” report says that

146
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,230
“China continues to develop a robust set
of mercantilist policies,

147
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,640
virtually all of which violate the spirit,

148
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,860
if not the letter, of the World Trade Organization’s
laws.”

149
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,810
Now if you think that report is just making
things up to criticize China,

150
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,030
well, it turns out, the Chinese regime’s
policy is actually outlined

151
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,820
in its own strategic plans.

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,630
Like this 2006 plan by China’s State Council.

153
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,750
It reveals that Chinese policymakers intentionally
violated WTO rules

154
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,140
by restricting Chinese markets for advanced
technology,

155
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,380
limiting it to Chinese companies.

156
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,510
But, they also exploited the same WTO rules

157
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,570
to get Chinese technology companies

158
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,730
unfettered access to global markets.

159
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,590
The US has filed 22 WTO complaints

160
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,800
against China since 2001.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,340
Of course, the US isn’t perfect.

162
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,420
China has filed a dozen cases against the
US,

163
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,780
and, well,

164
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,160
everyone complains about each other in the
WTO.

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,340
That’s kind of what it’s for.

166
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,970
But China is definitely the winner.

167
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,430
Assuming the goal is to commit

168
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,550
as many WTO violations as you can.

169
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,610
But don’t forget,

170
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,920
it’s also the victim.

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,340
Carson Block, who lived in China and co-authored
the book

172
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,210
Doing Business in China for Dummies...

173
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,650
...says it’s not just the US that’s getting
a bum deal

174
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,250
doing business with China.

175
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,709
In his recent article “Yes, China Does Cheat
In Trade -

176
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,010
The Rest Of The World Needs To Wake Up”,

177
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,599
Block says that entire global trading system

178
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,680
is being harmed by China’s cheating.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,110
And that comes from the guy who literally
wrote the book

180
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,720
on how to do business in China.

181
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,810
But that book was published back in 2011.

182
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,170
Clearly his views have changed.

183
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,170
And I get it.

184
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,170
Your views can change

185
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,459
as you learn more and wise up.

186
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,010
Like, five years ago,

187
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,129
I thought this mustache looked amazing.

188
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,449
Anyway, according to the US Trade Representative’s
report

189
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,060
this past January,

190
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,819
over the past several years,

191
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:11,709
China has been using its state power more
and more

192
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,300
to undermine the free market

193
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,600
and hamstring foreign companies,

194
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
and that “it is now clear that the WTO rules

195
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,680
are not sufficient to constrain

196
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,579
China’s market-distorting behavior.”

197
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,009
And that is why that “False Promises”
report we looked at earlier

198
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:31,040
suggests that “only a policy of ‘constructive
confrontation’

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,199
will prove adequate in addressing China’s
increasingly

200
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,230
‘innovation mercantilist’ trade practices.”

201
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,009
And so when you get to the bottom of it,

202
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,260
US tariffs are looking more and more like

203
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,060
standing up to a trade bully than being one.

204
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,079
So when China’s Deputy Trade Minister says
this...

205
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,040
“As a WTO member,

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,519
China needs to do something

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,779
to safeguard the WTO rules.”

208
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,620
I suggest that instead of going around

209
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,550
complaining about the US,

210
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,519
the best thing the Chinese regime can do

211
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,269
to safeguard WTO rules

212
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,820
is to follow them.

213
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,019
I know, it’s so unfair.

214
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,029
And before we go,

215
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,470
it’s time for another question from someone

216
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,939
who contributes a dollar or more per episode

217
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:18,560
on the crowd-funding website Patreon.

218
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,970
Saitama asks:

219
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,300
”Can China withstand the trade war with
the US?"

220
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
That’s a good question.

221
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,430
One of the great things about being ruled

222
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,810
by an authoritarian regime that controls

223
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,160
most major sectors of the economy

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,220
is that China has a lot more ability

225
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,279
to withstand economic hardship than, say,

226
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,300
a democracy does.

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,850
Like in the 2008 financial crisis,

228
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,589
the US suffered an enormous recession.

229
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,879
But the Chinese Communist Party

230
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,999
was able to bail out its economy

231
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,649
with a massive stimulus package.

232
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,079
And that’s largely because it controlled

233
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,199
China’s banking sector, energy, mining,

234
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,759
steel, and really most of the big industries.

235
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,680
Now usually in a trade war,

236
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,740
the net exporter will lose the most.

237
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,340
And China is the net exporter in this case.

238
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,310
But at the same time,

239
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,240
the Chinese Communist Party is highly skilled
at

240
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,029
dealing with financial crises

241
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,220
and it has lots of money to spend.

242
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,990
So it will try to outlast the US as long as
it can.

243
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,029
It’s not going to just give in to Trump’s
arm-twisting

244
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,850
after a few months.

245
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,710
This could be a long war.

246
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,399
What the Chinese Communist Party is most worried
about

247
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,139
is a massive economic downturn.

248
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,790
That could easily lead to unemployment,

249
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,459
unemployment to riots,

250
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,319
and riots could bring down the Communist Party—

251
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,899
since its legitimacy is based on its promise

252
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,230
to deliver economic prosperity.

253
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,630
In America, angry citizens can vote new people
into office.

254
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,029
But in China, angry citizens can bring down
the entire system.

255
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,290
Thanks for your question, Saitama.

256
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,249
And what do all of you think about the reasons

257
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,720
behind the US-China trade dispute?
