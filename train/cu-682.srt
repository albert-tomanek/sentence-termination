00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,790
live election coverage from Beijing...

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,400
sort of.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,299
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:12,869
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,910
As a member of the media,

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,620
I have to say that nothing gets us more excited

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,900
than an election.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,960
It’s like sports for news!

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,070
Winners and losers,

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
ridiculous 3D graphics,

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,810
and 30 people yelling over each other

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,170
on live television.

14
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,699
Plus, who doesn’t love a surprise ending!

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,699
“He’s won the 2016 US presidential election.

16
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,550
One of the most extraordinary elections

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,950
any of us have ever seen.”

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,290
Well, since China Uncensored is about China,

19
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,800
I had to watch the US election last year

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,920
from the sidelines.

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,570
But now, it’s my turn.

22
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,100
It’s what I’ve been waiting for the last
five years.

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,200
Yes, it’s time for the 19th National Party
Congress

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,050
of the Communist Party of China!

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,190
Think of it like the Republican

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,739
or Democratic National Conventions.

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,130
Participants travel from across the country,

28
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,680
wearing the colorful native dress of their
regions.

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
It’s a hugely staged event where delegates

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,979
“vote” on predetermined outcomes.

31
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,520
And there are some crazy after-parties.

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,130
I hear former premier Zhu Rongji

33
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,100
throws the best EDM ragers,

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,359
if that’s your thing.

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,310
But there is one tiny little difference.

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,020
Since the Communist Party is the only Party
in China,

37
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,889
the people they chose at their congress

38
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:27,789
will be the ones who rule the country

39
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,880
for the next five years.

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,030
You see, as an organization,

41
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,029
the Chinese Communist Party sits on top of

42
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:37,009
the Chinese government like a giant parasite.

43
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,420
The kind that mind controls its host into
doing

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,840
whatever the parasite wants.

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,369
So while the Party’s top leaders

46
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,100
also hold government positions,

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,049
it’s their Party positions that really count.

48
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,049
For example,

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,219
Xi Jinping holds the title of President,

50
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,899
but he was only appointed President

51
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,789
because he holds the top Communist Party position:

52
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,869
General Secretary.

53
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,979
But most people outside China

54
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,350
don’t understand how this works.

55
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,759
So the 19th Party Congress is a great opportunity

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,639
for state-run media to make up complete lies

57
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,500
about how China has democracy

58
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,450
and meaningful elections.

59
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,730
“During the Party’s National Congress,

60
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,200
elections are also held for the Central Committee,

61
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,540
and the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection.”

62
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,390
Yes, it’s just like an election.

63
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
And that’s why,

64
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,700
even with no ballots cast yet,

65
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,360
we here at China Uncensored are able to project,

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
with 99.9% certainty,

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,670
that Xi Jinping will be “elected” to another
five-year term

68
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,500
as head of the Communist Party.

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,300
It’s a bold prediction,

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,220
but we will stake our reputation on it.

71
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,570
But just because Xi isn’t going anywhere,

72
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,210
doesn’t mean there’s nothing to watch
here.

73
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,790
There’s been huge speculation

74
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,041
about who’s going to be in

75
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,320
the next Politburo Standing Committee,

76
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,970
the seven men in charge of the Communist Party.

77
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,730
There’s even an online game

78
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,530
where you can pick your own Standing Committee.

79
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,350
Just like Fantasy Football.

80
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,820
They wouldn’t take my pick though,

81
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,660
which was Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi, and Xi.

82
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,970
What?

83
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,490
It could happen.

84
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,620
In a show of power,

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,760
Xi Jinping opened the 19th Party Congress
on Wednesday

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,750
by making everyone else sit through

87
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,260
his three and a half hour long speech.

88
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,380
Wow, I guess they don’t teach public speaking

89
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,840
at the Central Party School.

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,600
But everyone thoroughly enjoyed the speech,

91
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,770
as you can see from this thrilling montage

92
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,950
of past and current Party officials

93
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,680
listening attentively.

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,350
Xi Jinping’s speech was called,

95
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,590
“Secure a Decisive Victory in Building

96
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,810
a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects

97
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,810
and Strive for the Great Success

98
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,960
of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics

99
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,650
for a New Era.”

100
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,770
Or to paraphrase,

101
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,030
“Xi Jinping is Large and in Charge.”

102
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,270
But here on China Uncensored,

103
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,390
we’re not going to just tell you what was
in Xi’s speech.

104
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,560
No, we’re taking coverage of the Party Congress

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,630
to a whole new level.

106
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,900
Our very own Shelley Zhang

107
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,670
is reporting live from Beijing.

108
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,840
Shelley, isn’t it great to be back in the
motherland?Yes, Chris, it’s great.

109
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,590
You don’t seem excited.

110
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,549
I’m super excited.

111
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,030
You seem kind of...upset.

112
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,669
Why would I be upset, Chris?

113
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,219
I don’t know why you’d be upset.

114
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,620
This is a great opportunity for some on-the-ground
action.

115
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,659
Mmm, right.

116
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,279
Just one question, Chris.

117
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,139
Why did you send your only Chinese correspondent
to Beijing?

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,940
Isn’t it obvious?

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,080
You speak the language,

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,219
you blend in.

121
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,419
You can go undercover,

122
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,949
get the real story.

123
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,099
If I went,

124
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:48,229
I’d stand out like a sore, white thumb.

125
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,090
Are you kidding me?

126
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,050
First of all, I don’t blend in.

127
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,669
I’ve had to pretend to be Korean three times
today.

128
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,659
And if you were here and you got caught doing
this,

129
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,460
yeah sure, you’d get roughed up a little,

130
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,789
accused of being CIA,

131
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,080
and then deported on the next flight back
to New York.

132
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,740
Me?

133
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,009
I could end up spending the next three years

134
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,749
in a black jail in Hunan,

135
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:19,469
making Christmas lights with only one kidney.

136
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,469


137
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,469
Are you suggesting you want to leave?

138
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:22,860
What do you think?

139
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
No!

140
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,460
You can’t leave now.

141
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,030
China Uncensored is the number one comedy
news show

142
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,159
about China based in New York

143
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,061
and you’re our woman on the ground!

144
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,700
You’re not a quitter, are you?

145
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
I can’t believe you...fine.

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,780
Fine.

147
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,440
Let’s just get this over with.

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,240
That’s great!

149
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,840
I knew you wouldn’t let us down.

150
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,669
Because you’re a team player.

151
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,290
So Shelley, tell us about the color on the
ground.

152
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,290
The atmosphere.

153
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,680
Which faction has the best butter cow?

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,069
No one has a butter...

155
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,069
Wait, I almost forgot.

156
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,069
Put on the hat.

157
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:56,069
No.

158
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,069
Come on.

159
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:58,699
I’m not putting on the hat.

160
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,229
Put it on!

161
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,460
I’m not putting on!

162
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
Look, I’ll put on the hat, too.

163
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,840
Then we’ll both be wearing the hat.

164
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,500
There.

165
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,660
Isn’t this more fun already?

166
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:14,669
So much fun.

167
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,570
So Shelley, let’s get down to it.

168
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,860
What’s the theme of this year’s Congress?

169
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,340
National rejuvenation.

170
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Really?!

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,870
Xi only said it like 50 times in his...oh
no.

172
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,600
So in other words, Xi Jinping wants to make
China great again.

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,380
Yes.

174
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,020
And you didn’t want to wear the hat.

175
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,250
But let’s keep going.

176
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,860
Are there going to be any surprises

177
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,039
during the 19th Party Congress?

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,529
Without a doubt.

179
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,529
Really.

180
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,050
Does it involve who’s going to be “elected”

181
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,210
to the Politburo Standing Committee?

182
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,960
Signs point to yes.

183
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,460
Wow.

184
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,540
Can you elaborate on that?

185
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,500
Reply hazy, try again.

186
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,400
Wait.

187
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,409
Are you...

188
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,419
reading this off a Magic 8 ball?!

189
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,960
You have problems with my sources?

190
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,580
Why don’t you come over here then,

191
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,060
and I’ll go back to New York.

192
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,560
Actually, I’m fine here.

193
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,040
Look, Chris,

194
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,620
there’s a reason Chinese politics is called
a black box.

195
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,240
You can’t tell what’s really happening

196
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,130
because each faction will only leak information

197
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,110
that’s to their own benefit.

198
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,550
The media might have “inside sources”

199
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,870
but that means nothing.

200
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,660
They have no idea what’s going on.

201
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,520
So it’s exactly like the US election.

202
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,930
Except for the part where I’ll get arrested
for being here.

203
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,300
Alright, let’s cut to the chase.

204
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,690
There’s only two things

205
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,330
that we need to know from the Party Congress.

206
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,330
One:

207
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,300
Does Xi Jinping have enough power to reshape

208
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,090
the Politburo Standing Committee in his image.

209
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,389
And Two:

210
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,610
Does Xi Jinping have enough power to get named

211
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,309
Chairman of the Communist Party.

212
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:51,529
Chairman, eh?

213
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:52,800
The big C.

214
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,760
That would be a huge move.

215
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,420
Would Xi really do that?

216
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,120
Don’t underestimate Xi Jinping’s ambition.

217
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,240
Some analysts are like,

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,470
oh there’s no precedent for doing these
things.

219
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,430
But since Xi’s been in power,

220
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,069
he’s completely overhauled the military.

221
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,749
He’s spent five years going after his political
enemies.

222
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:14,899
He’s going to change the Party to what he
wants it to be.

223
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,990
So you’re saying that Xi’s not a precedential
kind of guy.

224
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,749
Did you really just do that?

225
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,169
Pretty good, right?

226
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,169
So what about the Politburo Standing Committee?

227
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,689
How could he change that?

228
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,199
I don’t even want to…

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,360
Come on.

230
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,030
What if I promise not to make any more puns?

231
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,370
Ok deal.

232
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,860
It starts with Wang Qishan,

233
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,830
Xi’s ally and head of the anti-corruption
campaign.

234
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,510
Wang is 69,

235
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,540
so according to the “seven up, eight down”
precedent

236
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,760
started by former leader Jiang Zemin,

237
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,960
Wang is supposed to retire.

238
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,820
But Xi might try to keep him on, anyway.

239
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,740
So we’re looking to see if Xi

240
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,630
can keep him on Wonger than expected?

241
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,770
What did we just talk about?

242
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,810
Sorry, it won’t happen again.

243
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,810
Ok.

244
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,720
If Xi keeps Wang,

245
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,000
it means Xi is powerful enough to shake things
up,

246
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,280
especially since Jiang’s faction is attacking
Wang.

247
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Or Xi could let Wang retire,

248
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,370
but reduce the number of Standing Committee
members

249
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,230
from 7 to 5,

250
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,570
which would also give him more control.

251
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,100
So we’ll have to Xi how Wong this goes on.

252
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,180
I really hate your puns.

253
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,200
Hey, don’t be a Party pooper.

254
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
But seriously, can Xi Jinping become chairman

255
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,540
and change the standing committee?

256
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,980
It’s hard to say.

257
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,300
Xi’s not as powerful

258
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,970
as the Western media makes him look...

259
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,130
not yet.

260
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,080
When the Congress ends next week

261
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,930
and we see the new Standing Committee,

262
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,500
we’ll know how much Xi can change the Party

263
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,310
in the next five years.

264
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,170
So after the Party Congress,

265
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,240
there’s the after Party Congress?

266
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,460
You know the best part about all of this?

267
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,470
What?

268
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,470
What?

269
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,970
I could have told you all of this from New
York.

270
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,970
Speaking of that,

271
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,580
did you get my email about sneaking into

272
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,850
the Great Hall of the People

273
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,400
and getting us some exclusive footage?

274
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,720
Uh, Chris, I gotta go.

275
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,380
Uh, Shelley?

276
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
I’m sure she’s fine.

277
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,020
Thanks Shelley!

278
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,070
And there you have it,

279
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,440
the latest from Beijing.

280
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,690
The 19th Party Congress will go on,

281
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,700
and on, through next Tuesday.

282
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
And by then,

283
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
we’ll know slightly more

284
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
about what’s going to happen

285
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,030
over the next five years.

286
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,720
What are your predictions?

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,830

288
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,350
