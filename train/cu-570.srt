1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,160
On the 70th anniversary of communist rule
in China

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,859
A massive military parade in Beijing

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,410
Showcased some fancy new weapon systems

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,500
But how dangerous do they make the Chinese
military?

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored. I’m Chris
Chappell.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,080
This episode is sponsored by Surfshark...

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,170
because if you’re going to be making fun
of

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,390
the Chinese Communist Party,

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,119
you’re going to want a reliable VPN to hide
your identity.

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,000
Seventy years ago on October 1st, the world's
bloodiest dictator

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,420
took over the world's most populous nation

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,210
with the world’s most murderous ideology.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,070
And from then on, the Communist Party

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,460
has ruled what it called the People's Republic
of China.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,940
And to celebrate seventy uninterrupted years
of communist delight,

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,010
China's leaders threw the country a birthday
party.

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,649
And no birthday party would be complete without

18
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,359
some cutting-edge weapons of mass destruction.

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,360
Get him, Tanya!

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,270
That donkey will never walk again.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,130
Ok, I actually meant these cutting-edge weapons
of mass destruction.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,479
Bigger sticks, but no candy.

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,680
There once was a time that China relied on

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,320
reverse-engineered Soviet military systems,

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,360
or, at best, developed sub-standard weapons
at a snail's pace.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,020
But not anymore!

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,350
Now China relies on reverse-engineered US
military systems,

28
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,910
and uses that to develop not only its own
tanks and planes,

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,540
but also cutting-edge stealth technology,

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
combat drones,

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,430
and hypersonic missiles.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,920
Not to mention the latest in pop-up leadership.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,280
In the past decade, China's defence budget

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,840
has grown by at least 10% every year.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,520
At $168.2 billion dollars,

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,040
China's military spending is now second only
to the United States.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,640
Yeah, there’s still a lot of distance between
first and second place.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,630
China’s October 1 parade saw familiar weapons

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,390
like Wing Long combat drones that were deployed
in Libya,

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,049
or DF-26 missiles dubbed "the Guam Killers"

41
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,659
because they have the range to hit military
installations

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,229
in the US territory of Guam

43
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,869
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

44
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,980
But besides these important staples,

45
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,760
the Chinese military showcased some sophisticated
new systems,

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,629
including a few world-firsts.

47
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,080
So in today's episode,

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,580
let's look at nine military systems that got
the red carpet treatment

49
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,930
on the 70th anniversary of communist rule
in China.

50
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,280
Number 9

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,090
First, what pundits widely called the biggest
surprise of the day—

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,599
the Dongfeng-17.

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,730
It's a known fact that the People’s Liberation
Army Rocket Force,

54
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,730
or PLARF,

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,890
would play a central role in any conflict
involving China.

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,209
Little surprise then that missiles were center
stage.

57
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,720
Specifically, the DF-17—

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,010
ballistic missiles that deploy

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,730
a triangular hypersonic glide vehicle.

60
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,150
They launch like an ordinary ballistic missile.

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,440
But the warhead has small wings,

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,379
and after separating from the booster,

63
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,980
it acts like a maneuverable glider.

64
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,940
Hypersonic, so it can fly at five to ten times
the speed of sound

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,760
and deliver a conventional or nuclear warhead.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,370
The glider lets the DF-17 fly at a flatter
trajectory

67
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,860
and so avoid enemy radar.

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,940
They're harder to detect and can evade

69
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,620
anti-ballistic missile interceptors.

70
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,370
Countries like Russia and the US are said
to be

71
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,019
working on similar designs,

72
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,290
but so far China’s the only one

73
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,700
that's got this in its official arsenal.

74
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,629
Number 8

75
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,830
Another much-anticipated hot-off-the-assembly-line
weapon

76
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,129
making its public debut is the road-mobile
DF-41

77
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,610
intercontinental strategic nuclear missile
system.

78
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,950
One missile can pack a single big wallop

79
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,200
or carry up to 10 independently targetable
warheads.

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,310
Prior to the launch of the DF-41,

81
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,069
China didn’t have a ballistic missile

82
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,850
capable of hitting the U.S. mainland

83
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,409
in the event of a nuclear war.

84
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,409
The best they could do was hit Guam.

85
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,100
But with the DF-41, China looks to have overcome

86
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,599
its biggest weakness in military strategy
against the United States.

87
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,690
Chinese state media say this rollout is for,
quote,

88
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,019
“balancing power and securing victory.”

89
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,910
Um, against no target in particular,

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,040
but just so you know,

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,750
the continental United States is within range.

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,990
Number 7

93
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,440
Another new weapon that was supposed to be
shrouded in mystery

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,810
but got leaked in a promo video ahead of the
parade

95
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,180
was hidden inside these launch canisters.

96
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,060
They say "DF-100" on the side,

97
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,800
but maybe to restore a sense of mystery,

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,990
the CCTV announcer called it the CJ-100 hypersonic
cruise missile.

99
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,550
“Here comes the CJ-100 cruise missile formation…

100
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,290
the latest in the CJ series.

101
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,120
The hypersonic weapon features high precision,

102
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,180
and long-range strike capability, as well
as fast response.”

103
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,410
The CJ stands for Cháng Jiàn or “Long
Sword.”

104
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,190
The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force

105
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,110
“accidentally” posted footage of what
appears to be

106
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,419
a test launch of the CJ or DF-100 a week before
the parade.

107
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,210
An expert told the South China Morning Post

108
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,500
that the missile's slim dorsal fins,

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,050
foldable tail fins and additional propellant

110
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,139
suggests it's a long-distance hypersonic weapon

111
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,680
with "a range of more than 680 miles.”

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Can’t hit the US, but it’s good enough
for the South China Sea.

113
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,810
Number 6

114
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,880
Another debut was the JL-2 submarine-launched
ballistic missile or SLBM.

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,419
“The second generation JL-2 can be launched
from nuclear submarines.”

116
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,630
...launched with just the wave of a hand.

117
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,840
The People's Liberation Army Navy started
testing

118
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,930
the JL-2 from submarines as far back as 2002.

119
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,460
Since 2016, the Chinese military has had 48
launchers and warheads

120
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,419
ready to deploy from nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines.

121
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,650
But until this October 1 parade,

122
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,169
the Chinese military had never officially
acknowledged

123
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,560
the existence of this weapon.

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,900
So this was the official unveiling of the
JL-2,

125
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,650
which is believed to have a range of more
than 5,000 miles

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,690
and the ability to deliver one big nuclear
warhead,

127
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,340
or up to 8 smaller nukes.

128
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,550
It’s like getting one big cupcake,

129
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,229
or 8 mini cupcakes.

130
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,949
Of radioactive destruction.

131
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,440
Number 5

132
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,789
After sleek-looking missiles,

133
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,990
it was time for something that looked a little
more goth—

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,750
the HSU-001 drone submarine.

135
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,650
It looks like the submarine equivalent of
too much black eyeliner.

136
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,620
But like the Smashing Pumpkins,

137
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,009
this Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

138
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,139
"could be a game changer."

139
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,130
Since it’s the world's first openly deployed
fully-robotic submarine

140
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,490
capable of long-range missions,

141
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,220
this submersible drone could really be a sea-change
in naval warfare.

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,550
So far though, only small, short-range drone
subs have been used—

143
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,650
because long-range autonomous subs are too
expensive and complex.

144
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,810
Not much is known about this HSU-001,

145
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,050
but since it doesn't have any torpedo tubes

146
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,630
I assume it’s to be used for spying...

147
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,090
on the mermaids in the South China Sea.

148
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,130
How dare they violate China’s territorial
waters!

149
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,900
Those mermaids better recognize the nine-dash
line.

150
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,470
Number 4

151
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,590
Another drone debut was this blade-like craft

152
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,990
with the designation DR-8 or WZ-8.

153
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,980
A supersonic spy drone.

154
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Designed to soar over the Pacific ocean at
speeds

155
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,820
ranging between three and five times the speed
of sound,

156
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,970
the supersonic spy drone uses a mysterious
propulsion system.

157
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,629
The Chinese military has not disclosed

158
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,900
any information about the propulsion,

159
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,599
but the tech nerds at The Aviationist figure
that

160
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,930
it's probably a liquid or hybrid rocket engine.

161
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,760
The South China Morning Post reported that

162
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,470
“The DR-8 would be expected to play a key
role

163
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,770
should there be a conflict with U.S. aircraft
carrier strike groups

164
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,460
in the South China Sea or Western Pacific.”

165
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,080
The DR-8 spy drone is said to be able

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,970
to launch from the ground or from another
aircraft.

167
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,370
Though frankly, even in the parade it’s
terrifying.

168
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,020
Number 3

169
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,560
The H-6N Long-Range Bomber is an upgraded
version of the H6 series,

170
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,690
which until now could only carry and drop
gravity nuclear bombs.

171
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,740
But the fuselage of the new H-6N seems to
have a cavity

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,260
that would allow it to carry a huge air-launched
nuclear missile.

173
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,120
And in smog like that, you probably won’t
see it coming.

174
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,990
Another new feature is an in-flight refueling
probe

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,070
for air-to-air top-ups.

176
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,120
That would give the H-6N an estimated range
of 3,700 miles.

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,680
Or from Beijing to...Alaska?

178
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,420
Not really a threat.

179
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,920
Number 2

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,750
Another new reveal was the latest version

181
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,940
of the “Sharp Sword” stealth combat drone,

182
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,850
the Hongdu GJ-11 Lijian.

183
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,430
The drone “now features a completely redesigned
rear aspect

184
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,570
with a stealthier exhaust.”

185
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,709
Because sometimes, you just need a stealthy
exhaust.

186
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,090
The drone can carry two tons of laser-guided
bombs or missiles.

187
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,990
It also happens to look a bit like the U.S.
Navy’s X-47B attack drone.

188
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,510
I’m not saying it was stolen technology,
but...

189
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,480
Anyway, good luck,

190
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,700
because America’s X-47B supposedly performed
well in tests

191
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,269
but was never deployed.

192
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,110
In any case, a non-weaponized version of the
GJ-11

193
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,190
will deploy on Chinese aircraft carriers,

194
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,190
all two of them,

195
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,880
where it will be used for surveillance

196
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,080
and reconnaissance missions.

197
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,010
Number 1

198
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,680
The final debut worth mentioning is one

199
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,160
that looks like you could order the kit from
Taobao

200
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,780
and assemble it in your garage:

201
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,330
A two-man gyrocopter called the Hunting Eagle.

202
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,050
The ‘Hunting Eagle’ gyrocopter is basically
a smaller,

203
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,350
cheaper and slower version of a helicopter.

204
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,310
So...it would be terrible in combat.

205
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,730
But don’t worry, this eagle won’t be in
combat.

206
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,910
The “hunting” part means “search and
rescue, border control,

207
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,149
reconnaissance, anti-riot, and other roles.

208
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,640
It will also be used to self-deploy Chinese
special forces

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,490
on missions into enemy territory.”

210
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,850
So...not as fierce as those other weapons,

211
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,110
but I still wouldn’t want that landing in
my back yard.

212
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,670
Or in Hong Kong.

213
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,610
So why did the Chinese Communist Party

214
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,790
choose to show off all these advanced weapons?

215
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,450
For the same reason my friend Damien

216
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,790
always takes his shirt off at the gym in front
of the ladies.

217
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,870
Sure, he gets a lot of attention.

218
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,870
But deep down inside, he’s insecure.

219
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,300
And he wants America to know that

220
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,460
if they mess with him in the South China Sea,

221
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,050
he can stand up for himself.

222
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,839
Wait, I’m not talking about Damien anymore.

223
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,300
But it’s basically the same thing.

224
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,140
Think of this month’s giant military parade

225
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,610
like Xi Jinping with his shirt off.

226
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,390
Wait, don’t think about that.

227
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,040
But anyway,

228
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,839
just because the Chinese Communist Party is
insecure,

229
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,130
doesn’t mean its military is just a bluff.

230
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,820
They’ve spent decades stealing US technology

231
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,839
and developing their own weapons.

232
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,980
Sure, their troops lack combat experience.

233
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,670
But some of their weapons could still cause

234
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,490
major damage to the US in a war.

235
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,610
And the Chinese Communist Party televised
the whole parade,

236
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,750
and broadcast a version with English voiceover,

237
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,470
to make sure that its frenemy across the Pacific
knows what’s up.

238
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,519
