00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,310
A Pro-Democracy Legislator

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,560
In a city on the brink of totalitarianism

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,680
Is there hope left for Hong Kongâ€™s liberty?

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,060
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,520
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,859
Joining me today is Hong Kong attorney

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,769
and activist Tanya Chen.

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,430
She is a member of Hong Kong's legislative
council.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,620
Thanks for joining me today.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,620
Thank you Chris.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,619
These protests have gone on for over a hundred
days.

12
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,710
Police have said they might have to shoot
a protester

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,570
and then on October 1st,

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,430
they shot a protester point blank in the chest.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,390
How has that changed the situation?

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,430
First of all, I do believe that a lot of Hong
Kong people

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:53,890
found that the brutality and use of force
has escalated

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,390
since the 1st of October.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,990
And especially we have seen a lot of different
occasions

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:09,460
that our police seems to have lost control
and acted

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,299
in a very aggressive way.

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,280
And not only to the protesters,

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,460
but also to the first aiders, the reporters
or journalist

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,400
as well as the bystanders.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,280
So I think this is a very dangerous situation
that our

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,240
supposed to be a professional team of laws
enforcement team

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,909
now acted in such a way and I of course,

28
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,490
I have no idea why there seems to be such
a escalation,

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,530
a very obvious escalation of force,

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,469
but at the same time I really worry that there
may be

31
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,649
some instructions or commands

32
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,429
from the high level of the police force

33
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,209
which encourage the frontline police officers

34
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:09,479
to use force with I would say with lesser
control.

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,770
Do you think the more aggressive tactics

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,530
of some of the frontline protesters

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,629
are also responsible for escalating the situation?

38
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,379
Well of course you can see that there

39
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,939
is a kind of escalation on both sides,

40
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:28,900
but still you can see our police officers

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,790
got a lot of different weapons.

42
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,560
Though sometimes we will call it less lethal
weapons,

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,110
but still they are quite dangerous.

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,420
For example, tear gas, batons,

45
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,390
especially the use of batons in the past,

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,920
we can see that the police officers use batons.

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,099
I don't think they used batons

48
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,690
according to international standards

49
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,860
or even their instructions.

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,870
So all these are in fact a very powerful and
dangerous weapons

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,560
that the police force are using.

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
And there's been some accusation that they're
even

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,110
using their rubber bullet guns and their tear
gas

54
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,659
in improper way aiming for the head.

55
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,659
Yes, exactly.

56
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,310
I think all these incidents and different
scenes

57
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,489
make people really worried about the escalation
of force,

58
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,180
and it seems that they are now kind of

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,770
a taking a revenge on this protesters.

60
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,370
So this is absolutely another level,

61
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,060
and it's very difficult to turn away from
the hatred

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,870
or these kinds of revenge or these kinds of
emotions.

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,590
So it's very important for the government,

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,140
for Mrs. Carrie Lam to understand the situation,
the danger,

65
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,090
and the situation is so critical,

66
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,840
that I would say she is just three centimeter
away

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,909
from a point of no return.

68
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,780
And that's why I really hope that she will
positively answer

69
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,370
or at least responds to our five demands.

70
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,120
Do you think there's any way the Hong Kong
government

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,569
or Carrie Lam can deescalate the situation
now

72
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,350
if they're that close to the edge?

73
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,350
Absolutely.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,350
She has the power,

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,490
she is our chief executive and if she really
understand

76
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,310
or at least she has some reflections or inspiration

77
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,770
after having dialogue with the citizens

78
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,680
in the last dialogue sections last week,

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,490
I really think that she would now really appreciate
that the five,

80
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,110
the importance of these five demands to the
future of Hong Kong;

81
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,740
for example, like an independent commission
of inquiry.

82
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:07,480
I think at least more 
than half of the citizens

83
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,680
that have a chance to speak, raised this point.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,229
So this is a very clear demands

85
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,080
and of course with the support of polls,

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,030
all these very important information that

87
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,870
she can refer to and she can of course

88
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,300
give a positive answer to our society.

89
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,940
And of course the five demands,

90
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,960
it's a universal suffrage.

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,979
I think that's clear.

92
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,280
Without universal suffrage,

93
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,669
we can't even hold her accountable to Hong
Kong people.

94
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:47,520
So I think this is the only way forward if
she

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,080
positively responds to our five demands.

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,280
Speaking of the investigation into police
brutality,

97
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,970
I know recently you spoke at the UN asking

98
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,270
for their help to investigate that.

99
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,110
What role do you think the international community

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,050
has in the Hong Kong protest?

101
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,710
After these more than 110 days of protest,

102
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,740
it seems that we have a great difficulty

103
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,319
in getting this independent commission of
inquiry.

104
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:27,360
And you can see very clearly that the biggest
obstructions

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,250
or objections is from the pro establishment
camp.

106
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:41,160
But still, we really hope that the UN, the
United Nation,

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,750
the human rights committee will appreciate
our situation

108
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,599
and will set up this independent inquiry.

109
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,830
I think this is the fairest way to look into
the matters

110
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,289
of not only police brutality,

111
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,710
but if they want to investigate the course
of this whole protest,

112
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,710
please do.

113
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,979
I think that's the way to go forward.

114
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,419
And this is the only way that we can understand
the situation

115
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,639
and to improve in the future.

116
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,720
Now there's been talk of passing an anti mask
law

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,690
or invoking emergency ordinances to stop the
protests.

118
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,080
Do you think that would work?

119
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,020
Frankly speaking, I don't think that will
work,

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,800
they will only make people even angrier.

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,590
And after using all these very brutal force
unnecessarily

122
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,639
and disproportionately,

123
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,860
you can see that people still took to the
street,

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,080
even without the notification from the police.

125
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,930
And it seems that the people, well actually,

126
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:55,699
people are quite determined to fight this
battle.

127
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:02,039
And so with all these anti mask law or even
a curfew,

128
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,419
I'm afraid that they won't turn people away.

129
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,139
They would just make people again take to
the street,

130
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,270
and join any assembly or walk or march they
can.

131
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,099
Don't the people who are pushing the anti
mask law

132
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,379
and the emergency powers ordinances,

133
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,889
don't they know that people will just ignore
those?

134
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,050
Those who are pushing these laws,

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,050
are those who encourage.

136
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,240
I believe they are those who encouraged

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,510
Mrs. Kerry Lam to put forward,

138
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,320
or at least to push the extra edition bill

139
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,810
four to five months ago.

140
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,260
So I don't think these people

141
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,720
understand the present situation in Hong Kong.

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,250
Or they understand it,

143
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:53,660
but they just turn a blind eye to the critical
situation.

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,890
Or maybe it's something that the Chinese government
wants to do

145
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:05,430
because after pausing, or actually after the
1st of October,

146
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,430
the National Day, they can do anything they
want, they think.

147
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,190
And probably they will use even more high
handed method

148
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,920
to suppress or to press Hong Kong people.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,450
So this is a part of their strategy.

150
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,149
What do you think legislators like yourself

151
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,450
can do to challenge Beijing's will in Hong
Kong?

152
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,750
Unfortunately we are the minority

153
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,180
under the present political situation.

154
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,500
It might be very difficult for us

155
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,019
to get all these motions or even these motions
to be passed.

156
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,079
But if the government,

157
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,080
or if Mrs. Carrie Lam,

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,740
once you pass this very powerful law, for
example,

159
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:05,310
like the anti mask law, based on emergency
regulations ordinance,

160
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,560
I think this will have a very longterm

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,250
and negative effect on Hong Kong.

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,350
And it will definitely affect Hong Kong's
economy

163
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,980
and international reputation.

164
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,300
So I really want to remind her

165
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:36,320
that though it may have some short term effect,

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,209
it will definitely adversely affect Hong Kong
in long run.

167
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,920
What would these emergency regulation ordinances,

168
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,970
what would they do?

169
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,970
What kind of powers

170
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,480
would they give Carrie Lam?

171
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,410
First of all, these emergency regulation ordinance

172
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,720
is a very powerful ordinance because the name,

173
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,660
you can tell from name,

174
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,639
and Mrs. Carrie Lam can avoid to take the
bill

175
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,029
to the legislature for legislature's scrutiny.

176
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:11,220
So she together with the executive council
can pass a law,

177
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,110
which is even inconsistent with the present
ordinances in Hong Kong.

178
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,170
For example, like the Bill of Rights.

179
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,230
So it's very easy for her to take away our
freedoms,

180
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,339
our civil rights without any scrutiny of legislature.

181
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,209
So it's a very, very dangerous,

182
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,290
but at the same time a very powerful law.

183
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,730
So it seems like there's some kind of shady
things

184
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,120
being done with basic law.

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,269
Yes, yes.

186
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,760
And at the same time,

187
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,279
it's very difficult for legislators to voice

188
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:54,339
or even to interrupt the only value left probably,

189
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,680
it's our courts.

190
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,430
But is it again for court to resolve political
problems?

191
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:12,360
I don't think that's the appropriate venue
for courts to do so.

192
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,740
So more than 2,000 people have been arrested

193
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,930
since the start of these protests.

194
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,670
You yourself were arrested

195
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,579
for participating in the 2014 umbrella movement

196
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,389
and given a suspended prison sentence.

197
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,970
What are these protesters facing after arrest?

198
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,339
First of all, of course is the pressure.

199
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,899
If they got arrested, and they've got bail,

200
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,720
of course they need to follow the bail terms,

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,490
no matter it is a court bail, or a police
bail.

202
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,510
Secondly, they may be charged.

203
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,720
The prosecution may lay charges against them
anytime,

204
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:59,050
and whether this situation will affect their
decision in the future,

205
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,310
I don't know.

206
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,589
But obviously for example, like for me,

207
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,389
I've been arrested for three times and they
charged me

208
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:16,079
at the very last occasion, with two very,
very unusual charges.

209
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,390
One is incite people to commit a public nuisance.

210
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,160
And the second one is incite others to incite
public nuisance.

211
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,410
Exactly.

212
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,649
Exactly.

213
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,899
Exactly.

214
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,829
That's the reason why I need to name my two
counts of charges

215
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,410
because it's not usual.

216
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,871
And in fact, at that moment you can see that
in Hong Kong

217
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:46,519
we have other charges that is more normal
and usual

218
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,110
that can be used by the prosecution.

219
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,980
But by charging us with, we call it a [inaudible]
offenses.

220
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,449
That means aiding and abetting or inciting.

221
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:01,630
This kind we call it [inaudible] offenses.

222
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,830
The maximum penalty of these offenses is seven
years,

223
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,430
so they can immediately escalate the maximum
penalty of our charges.

224
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,400
So they make sure that we are going to face

225
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,360
the most serious charges that they can handle,

226
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,540
or at least they can try to prove.

227
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,130
So that's our situation.

228
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,120
And of course from 2014 until now,

229
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,690
we have only gone through the first level
of the court.

230
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,490
So we have our case,

231
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,089
it has been handled by the district court

232
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,959
and now we are waiting for a court of appeal,

233
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,079
and probably will go to the court of final
appeal.

234
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,120
So the whole process may take three to four
years to finish.

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,970
And so, I can only tell those who are being
arrested,

236
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,579
please do seek your legal advice.

237
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:05,470
But at the same time, as a legislator with
a legal background,

238
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:12,240
I would tell them that think twice before
they act.

239
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,470
Because I think most of them are prepared

240
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,420
or at least prepared in a sense that they
understand

241
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,430
the possibility of being charged.

242
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,980
But still you may need to face them

243
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,550
and you may need to face them for a very long
time.

244
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,949
So I still believe that people should think
twice before they act.

245
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,370
So when you say that, should they not be protesting?

246
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,839
Or how can they balance this fight

247
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,050
that the protestors believe was staying safe?

248
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:49,230
As far as I understand, some or most of the
protesters

249
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,900
do understand that they are participating

250
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,300
in different kinds of activities.

251
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,040
And all these activities, some of them may
lead to

252
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,870
various potential legal charges or criminal
charges

253
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:14,930
that may affect their future.

254
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,370
The only thing that I really want to tell
them is to think twice

255
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,690
because that is something that not only will
be faced by yourself,

256
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,170
your own self, but maybe faced by your whole
family.

257
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,300
But I respect that decision.

258
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,360
But still this is a decision

259
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,500
needed to be made with sufficient information.

260
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,560
For example, like legal information,

261
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,720
as well as an understanding of the potential
consequences,

262
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,860
legal consequences and the consequences on
their future.

263
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,819
So is the Hong Kong judiciary system,

264
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,759
is it still impartial or are these politically
motivated arrests?

265
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,690
Well 40 arrests, of course,

266
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,200
because it's all handled by the police,

267
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:13,340
I still believe that the police can do a better
job.

268
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
For example,

269
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,980
You can see the difference between

270
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,710
the umbrella movement versus now.

271
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:24,080
For example, normally during the Umbrella
Movement

272
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,910
for those who are arrested,

273
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:36,270
the police normally would only detain them
for 10 to 16 hours.

274
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,610
And then they finished their investigation,

275
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,490
and they would release them on bail

276
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,270
or just detain them until conditional release.

277
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,250
But now, normally they would just detain them
for 40 hours

278
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,100
with a house search.

279
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,740
And with two, three, four statements, and
those irregularities

280
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,540
that I've heard from the lawyers,

281
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,180
and even worse, it's really worse.

282
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,040
It's really horrible.

283
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,130
During this protest.

284
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,620
For example, the lawyers wait outside

285
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,650
to meet their clients for hours.

286
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,420
Even more than 10 hours without seeing them.

287
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,100
And though the are clients requested to see
their lawyers.

288
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,880
But without seeing their lawyers, the caution
statement

289
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,120
were taken without legal advice.

290
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,530
Without meeting their lawyers beforehand,

291
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:43,810
despite request has been pleased or made to
the police officers.

292
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,870
So these are absolutely taking away their
civil rights

293
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,760
and it's against the practices and against
law,

294
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,990
but the police just ignore it.

295
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,050
And I think lot of malpractices

296
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,810
happened during these four months.

297
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,810
And because I'm lawyer,

298
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,380
I went to North Point police station,

299
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,150
I think on Monday.

300
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,880
And the first thing we do is to file a complaint

301
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,580
with the duty officer at that police station,

302
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,920
because the lawyers have been waiting

303
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,960
for more than 10 hours to meet their first
client.

304
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,980
And they have a whole list provided to the
police

305
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,850
more than 10 hours.

306
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,860
So that's the situation.

307
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,560
And those malpractice, I can't say limited,

308
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,910
but at least it's kind of under control

309
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,480
during the umbrella movement.

310
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,420
So I think this is something that is unfair,

311
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,280
impartial and definitely is affected by

312
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,890
their political affiliation or political views.

313
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,100
So I think this is absolutely unacceptable.

314
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,770
It doesn't seem like the protestors are going
to give up,

315
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,370
but it also seems like the Chinese communist
party

316
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,220
is not going to give ground.

317
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,600
How does this end?

318
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,550
I'm afraid that the Chinese government

319
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:07,970
is going to use a even more harsher or stronger,
harder attitude.

320
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,400
They were just having harder and tougher attitude
to us.

321
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,510
Hong Kong, so now Carrie Lam is just a puppet.

322
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,890
I'm afraid that the Chinese government will
just

323
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:29,020
interfere in all kinds of matters,

324
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,120
which supposed to be under our local jurisdictions.

325
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,780
For example, like the extradition bill.

326
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,770
I understand there is rumors saying that,

327
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,100
or there is news saying that our chief executive,

328
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:49,870
Mrs. Carrie Lam, Lee needs to get the approval

329
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,990
in order to withdraw the bill.

330
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,750
So I'm afraid that Chinese intervention in
our local matters

331
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,220
will become more and more often.

332
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
All right.

333
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,890
Thank you so much for joining me today.

334
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,890
Thanks.

335
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,890
Thank you very much.

336
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,890
Thank you Chris.

337
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:04,892
Thank you.
