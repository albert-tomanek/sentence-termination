1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,190
A viral ad

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,780
has Chinese censors going bonkers.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,919
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,480
This video went viral on Chinese social media.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,279
It’s an ad for the German camera company
Leica.

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,929
It’s basically a collage of all the insane
stuff

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,380
photographers have endured

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,250
to tell the world’s important stories.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,109
Presumably using Leica cameras.

11
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:32,369
And one of those insane stories involves a
photographer

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,120
covering the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,780
We proudly whisper to ourselves, “I’m
a hunter.”

14
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,420
Yeah, Tank Man was never going to get past
Chinese censors.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,420
Now maybe you don’t know the story.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,359
Possibly because you’re watching from inside
China,

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,199
and this is your first time using a VPN

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,870
to jump over the Great Firewall,

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,640
and the first thing you did for some reason

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,790
was to watch China Uncensored.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,340
But anyway, in June 1989,

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,850
the Chinese Communist Party sent troops into
Beijing

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,890
to crush a nonviolent student-led protest.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,250
According to the latest research, 10,000 civilians
were killed.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,180
In fact, June 4, 2019 will mark the 30th anniversary.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,570
And the Party has spent the last 30 years

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,370
making sure no one talks about it,

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,140
so a lot of Chinese kids today have no idea
it happened.

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,899
You can read more about the 30-year propaganda
campaign

30
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,130
in the book the People’s Republic of Amnesia
by Louisa Lim.

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,970
So you can see why the Party would be upset
about the Leica ad.

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,130
They spent so much time trying to get people

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,560
to forget the Tiananmen Square massacre,

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,370
and then Leica comes in like a wrecking ball.

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,189
The catchy kind that gets stuck in your head

36
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,180
and you can never unsee that video.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,770
I’m talking about the Leica ad.

38
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,590
Now sure, the Leica ad wasn’t meant for
the China market.

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,390
But it quickly spread on the Chinese internet.

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,899
And just as quickly,

41
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,960
Chinese authorities sent out this censorship
directive,

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,450
instructing websites to delete it.

43
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,450
Chinese censors even blocked the word Leica
from social media.

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,990
The theory was, if people can’t talk about
it,

45
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,830
everyone will just lose interest.

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,550
But they did not.

47
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,130
Reactions to the video on the Chinese Internet
were mixed though.

48
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,720
Some were very angry.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,380
But not for the reason you’d think.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,090
They weren’t mad because they discovered

51
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,690
their government massacred 10,000 people

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,630
and spent the last 30 years covering up.

53
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,440
They were mad because Leica has a partnership
with Huawei,

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,190
the Chinese telecom company with questionable
links

55
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,390
to the Chinese Communist Party.

56
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,390
One user wrote,

57
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,050
“Do you even deserve to collaborate with
our patriotic Huawei?”

58
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,730
Others were quite happy about it.

59
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,730
Zhou Fengsuo,

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,670
a Tiananmen survivor I’ve had on the show,

61
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,890
said “It captured the spirit of 30 years
ago.

62
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,850
I was in tears watching it.”

63
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,090
But you know, I got to hand it to Leica.

64
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,250
They understood that China’s heavy-handed
authoritarianism

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,850
is exactly the kind of thing those brave journalists

66
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,790
risk their own lives to expose,

67
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,100
and they stood up to…

68
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,240
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,220
Leica is trying to cover their butts?

70
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,490
They’re saying they had nothing to do with
the ad?

71
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,490
It turns out,

72
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,520
Leica did what any responsible company does

73
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,180
when being threatened by the Chinese Communist
Party.

74
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,620
They denied all personal responsibility,

75
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,300
and blamed the ad agency.

76
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,420
Leica said they made the ad without their
approval.

77
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,700
I know, it’s hard to believe that an ad
agency

78
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,790
just decided on its own to produce an expensive,

79
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,110
high production video for Leica

80
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,430
without getting Leica’s approval first.

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,390
Well, they didn’t.

82
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,640
“Leica’s Brazilian ad agency claims it
developed the film

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,740
with Leica representatives in Brazil.”

84
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
So really,

85
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,980
Leica can just throw its own Brazilian representatives

86
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,590
under the bus.

87
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,810
Because it’s one thing to stand up to

88
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,500
warlords who threaten your life...

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,030
...but you can’t expect Leica to stand up

90
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,640
to the thugs who threaten their profits!

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
So what do you think of the ad?

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,340
Let me know in the comments below.

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,870
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

94
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,730
a fan who support China Uncensored

95
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,540
with a dollar or more per episode,

96
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,840
by contributing through Patreon.

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,260
Benjamin Jull asks,

98
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,450
“With all this extra stimulus in the Chinese
banking system,

99
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,980
what is stopping local governments

100
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,570
and ordinary people from exploiting it?

101
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,380
Like taking out large loans they can’t pay
back,

102
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,100
then defaulting on the government to bail
them out?”

103
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,470
Excellent question.

104
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,000
The answer is...people *are* exploiting it.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,430
When people can borrow money easily and cheaply,

106
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,550
they’re often going to take out loans for
projects that are...

107
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,320
how shall I put it?

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Stupid.

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
Really stupid investments.

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,970
Like building homes that no one wants to live
in.

111
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,010
On the plus side,

112
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,850
even building stupid things contributes to
GDP!

113
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,660
And when GDP goes up,

114
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,440
local officials get promotions.

115
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Last year,

116
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,720
there were defaults on almost 18 billion dollars
of debt.

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,730
Defaults cause big problems.

118
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,150
But typically what happens is the central
government

119
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,350
just pumps more money into the system

120
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,350
to keep everything afloat.

121
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,120
It basically kicks the can down the line

122
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,620
to some time in the future.

123
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,710
The problem is,

124
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,150
sooner or later,

125
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,640
you lose control of the can.

126
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Or something.

127
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,100
Thanks for your question, Benjamin.

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,380
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

129
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,800
who support China Uncensored.

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,510
It’s only because of your support

131
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,120
that we’ve been able to cover topics

132
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,080
that most other media don’t want to,

133
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,740
because standing up to the Chinese Communist
Party

134
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,190
is really hard.

135
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,270
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

136
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,500
See you next time.
