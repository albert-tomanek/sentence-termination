1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,240
No, guys, it's a silent invasion.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,720
It's one of the most controversial books of
the year:

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,370
Silent Invasion by Professor Clive Hamilton.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,141
It details how the Chinese Communist Party

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,500
is infiltrating Australian society and politics.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,590
I sat down with Mr. Hamilton to discuss why

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,399
he refuses to be silent.

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,010
About this invasion.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,660
Thank you for joining us today, Professor
Hamilton.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,820
It's a pleasure to be here.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,890
So, In Silent Invasion,

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,010
you talk about dark money, spies,

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,370
and gullible politicians.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,410
Which should we be most terrified of?

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,489
Well, it's a constellation.

18
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,489
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,739
I wish I could pick out one,

20
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,480
but this is the thing about the CCP's influence

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,679
operations in Australia.

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,270
As one intelligence official described it
to me,

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,910
they call it a "Full Court Press."

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,270
I'm sure your American listeners will understand

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,350
that basketball term.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,570
I had to look it up.

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,980
It means an all-out offensive

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,010
and so what I describe in my book

29
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,300
is the whole series of operations whereby

30
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,380
the CCP and its agents have influence in Australia

31
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,500
and, from China, have attempted to influence

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,230
at times with great success all of Australia's

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,930
major institutions, from politics

34
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,480
to media to business nd of course,

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
into universities.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Yeah.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Well, I really appreciate

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,490
the basketball reference.

39
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,490
It sounds like the communist party really

40
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,600
scored a touchdown.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,200
So, when you're doing

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,410
the research for the book,

43
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,580
was there anything that surprised you?

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,310
I was constantly surprised...

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
No.

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,780
Nothing is sacred.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,560
No area of Australian society, politics

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
or culture is free from influence

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,270
if there is an opportunity there.

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,890
So, as you say, that was one of the

51
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,010
shocking elements that I came across,

52
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,600
the way in which ...

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
And I don't want to exaggerate this.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,190
My understanding is that this has only happened

55
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,810
in a small way so far, but the way in which
agents

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,520
of the CCP have made themselves present in
the

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,850
congregations of Chinese Christian churches
in

58
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,450
Australia and of course, the CCP is officially
an

59
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,459
atheist organization, so the infiltration

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,770
is certainly not because the CCP feels as
though

61
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,890
it needs to inject a spiritual element into
its ideology.

62
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,630
Is the Communist Party's infiltration targeting
any particular political party?

63
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,670
They're quite eclectic in their political
tastes.

64
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,540
They'll infiltrate anything that they can.

65
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,630
What impact do you hope Silent Invasion will
have?

66
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,849
I wrote the book in order to wake up Australians

67
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,410
to what is happening, to give them the full
picture

68
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,180
of the nature of these operations

69
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,850
and more particularly why.

70
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,780
Why is the CCP targeting Australia in this
way?

71
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,540
So, really, it's to bring about social change,

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,330
political change, in response to what I see,

73
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,800
as many others do, as a really big problem
in Australia.

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,160
How does this affect your average Australian

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,180
who might be more concerned about Rugby

76
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,510
or Vegemite or whatever the average Australian

77
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,410
is into these days?

78
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,390
when I've been going around the country giving
talks,

79
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,910
chatting to people about the book,

80
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,370
is that it seems to me that a very large

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,340
number of Australians had a kind of sense

82
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,900
that there was something wrong,

83
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,950
that they'd picked up something in the newspapers

84
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,099
or in the local community about some kind
of

85
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,900
intrusion from the CCP or a major Chinese
corporation

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,452
and it worried them.

87
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,510
There's a kind of unease about what's been

88
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,959
happening and therefore,

89
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,709
many non-Chinese-Australians and many

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,590
Chinese-Australians have seized upon the book

91
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,620
as a way of explaining more broadly

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,310
what has been happening,

93
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,740
this kind of niggling sense that they've had
that

94
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,060
there's something odd going on

95
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,500
that's made them feel uneasy.

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,130
What was your reaction when your

97
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,250
publisher told you they weren't going to publish

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,280
Silent Invasion?

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Were you like,

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
"Wow.

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,550
This is a great story for my book"?

102
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,800
I was deeply shocked.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,030
I've worked with for many, many years.

104
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,520
They have been extremely enthusiastic

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,750
about the book right up to the day before

106
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,400
I got the phone call and said,

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,099
"We're pulling the plug."

108
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,800
And they said subsequently in the phone call

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,180
and then in writing subsequently that they
did

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,240
because they were afraid of retaliation

111
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,940
from Beijing and I thought,

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,030
"It's a kind of brilliant but unwelcome

113
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,470
vindication of the essential argument of my
book."

114
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,940
So, it really worked out for you.

115
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,880
it certainly drew a huge amount of publicity

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,470
to the book and suddenly,

117
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,669
publication of my book became a free speech
issue.

118
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,470
Mind you, it's not a pleasant thing

119
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,760
to spend weeks and weeks feeling,

120
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,979
with good reason,

121
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,840
that the state security apparatus in Beijing

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,790
is keeping a very close eye on you.

123
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,760
I mean, am I at any risk,

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,580
being here with you right now?

125
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,900
Well, we did have a spy sitting outside of
this building

126
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,210
who was carrying with her what,

127
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,509
I was subsequently told,

128
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,860
was probably a sniffer,

129
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,970
which is a device that looked like a mobile
phone,

130
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,820
but in fact is a quite sophisticated electronic
device

131
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,921
that can pick up all wifi and mobile telephone
communication inside a building.

132
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:15,400
That sounds fun, to be getting that kind of
attention.

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,210
Well, it does unsettle one and after a while,

134
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,340
you do start to take notice of things around
you

135
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,009
that normally you wouldn't bother about...

136
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,560
There's no doubt, based on a vast and from
security

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,660
experts and the Australian Federal Police,

138
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,720
that the Chinese authorities in Australia
are

139
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,650
collecting a dossier on me.

140
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,080
I've been the subject of cyber intrusions.

141
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:53,410
I've been subjected to a really intense campaign
of vilification

142
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,820
Were you surprised by the controversy the
book generated?

143
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,009
You know, I anticipated it,

144
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,289
but in the abstract.

145
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,259
You know, you anticipate something.

146
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,520
I think this is going to be very controversial.

147
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,490
I think I'm going to be accused of racism

148
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,960
and anti-China xenophobia,

149
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,110
but when it actually happened,

150
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,320
it kind of comes on you with an intensity
and an

151
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,550
emotional place that is really quite hard
to take.

152
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,889
You need to have the skin of a rhino

153
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,590
to not want to crawl into a hole and stay
there.

154
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,860
The Chinese Embassy has said,

155
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,490
"Critics of the Chinese Communist Party

156
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,310
are filled with a Cold-War mentality

157
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,259
and anti-China hysteria and paranoia.

158
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,401
Which of those best describes you?"

159
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,900
Well, you know, I grew up in the cold war,

160
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,240
so may some of it's still hanging around me
somewhere,

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,620
but you know, the key point which many of
your

162
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,430
listeners understand is that whenever there's
any

163
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,080
criticism of the communist party, the communist
propaganda efforts work very hard to persuade

164
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,720
the
public that, in fact, it's the Chinese people

165
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,150
who are
under attack.

166
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,660
It's the only way it can really defend
itself from this kind of criticisms.

167
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,100
Is racism a real, potential problem?

168
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,830
On the question of whether the book will stimulate
racist elements in our society, anti-China

169
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,819
feeling ...
That was my concern from Day One

170
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,740
I took every measure I could as I researched

171
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,120
and wrote the book to avoid the possibility

172
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,690
that the book could lend any credibility

173
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,380
to those anti-China, racist elements

174
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,260
on the fringe of our society.

175
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,010
I consulted with people in the Chinese-Australian

176
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,760
community and reflected their views in the
book

177
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,050
and I think I do that quite effectively.

178
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,490
So, you really have to work quite hard to
draw

179
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,320
out of the book anything that can be used
to defend

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,810
the idea that the book is racist or stimulates
racism.

181
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,760
Some people have worked very hard at drawing

182
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,540
that conclusion from the book.

183
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,120
Some of them, I've been quite surprised.

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,280
I thought, "Why are you doing that?"

185
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,130
So, one of the fascinating things that

186
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,160
I've learned in the last four weeks

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,670
is how deeply entrenched in some segments

188
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,980
of the political left is the idea that any
criticism

189
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,500
of the communist party is a criticism of Chinese
people

190
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,750
and therefore, we must defend this oppressed
minority.

191
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,700
Give me a break.

192
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,300
I mean, Chinese-Australians that I spoke to,

193
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,050
many of them, don't feel that way.

194
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,300
You, defenders of multiculturalism,

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,770
should go and talk to them,

196
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,550
rather than community leaders who actually

197
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,040
represented United Front organizations

198
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,220
that dance to the Communist Party's tune.

199
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,170
You obviously have a lot of connections

200
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,270
in the Chinese-Australian community.

201
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,040
What was their reaction to your book?

202
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
Well, they welcomed it when I made contact

203
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,070
with them initially and started to talk to
them.

204
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,830
We found that last week that a group of Chinese-Australians

205
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,830
was very, very eager to have a launch

206
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,459
in Sydney for the book and I was really

207
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,040
blown away by the number of Chinese-Australians

208
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,769
that were packed in that room in Parliament
House in Sydney

209
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,890
and gave the book such an extraordinary,

210
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,750
enthusiastic launch off into the world.

211
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,779
Why do you think that was?

212
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,899
Well, I think that for the last ten to twenty
years,

213
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,990
many Chinese-Australians who are critical

214
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,270
of the Communist Party and say,

215
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,209
"We came to Australia to escape from

216
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,701
the clutches of the Communist party,

217
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,410
and now they're following me,"

218
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,040
Their voices have been silenced.

219
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,140
They've been marginalized.

220
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,420
They've been kicked out of the public debate

221
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,870
and the mainstream media and politicians

222
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,320
have been talking to community leaders,

223
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,149
who are, generally,

224
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,420
one United Front organizations.

225
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,480
So, many Chinese-Australians have been extremely
grateful

226
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
that finally someone in the mainstream

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,290
has been taking their complaints seriously

228
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,959
and has written a book about it.

229
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,600
And most important question:

230
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
how does this affect America?

231
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,279
Well, it has a huge implication for the United
States

232
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,660
and that is because the authorities in the
United States

233
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,100
from Congress to the CIA, FBI,

234
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,120
to think tanks inside the Beltway

235
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,650
that take notice of China to a whole lot of
scholars

236
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,970
across the country,

237
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,430
are watching very, very closely

238
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,680
what is happening in the Australian parliament,

239
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,510
to the debate that we've been discussing today,

240
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,660
with a view to copying the ways in which

241
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,410
Australian governments and Australian society

242
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,959
more broadly pushes back against Beijing's
attempts

243
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,250
to interfere with, influence, guide, and ultimately
control what happens in this country.

244
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,670
in your book it says, "The communist party
is using

245
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,930
democracy to destroy democracy."

246
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,769
What can liberal democracies do to protect
ourselves

247
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,769
and our freedoms?

248
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,300
Well, I think liberal democracies

249
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,800
need to muscle up.

250
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,560
I mean, here is a serious threat

251
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,370
to the foundational values of liberal democracy

252
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,350
led by very powerful economic incentives

253
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,670
coming from the Peoples' Republic of China

254
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,590
and I think we in the liberal democracies
need to

255
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,350
make a really fundamental decision,

256
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,960
one that we haven't been forced to do ...

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm about to say, "Ever," but certainly

258
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
for many decades.

259
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,140
And that is to decide: how much is our freedom
worth?

260
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,600
Thank you for joining us today, Professor
Hamilton.

261
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,790
I've enjoyed it.

262
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,790
Great.

263
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,970
And I would highly recommend

264
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,990
picking up a copy of Silent Invasion.

265
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,640
I've read it myself and you can find a link
