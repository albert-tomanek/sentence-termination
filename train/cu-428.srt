00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,740
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,600
it’s time for the UK to finally do something

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,120
about Hong Kong!

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,860
Well, first: tea time.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,360
But then they’ll definitely

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,840
do something about Hong Kong.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,700
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,340
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,660
In October, British citizen

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,230
and human rights advocate Benedict Rogers

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,930
tried to visit Hong Kong—

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,310
where he had lived from 1997 to 2002.

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,350
But this time when he landed at the airport,

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,750
Hong Kong immigration denied him entry.

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,210
My favorite Chinese state-run media,

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,309
The Global Times, called Benedict Rogers

17
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,899
“a threat to China’s sovereignty, safety
and interests.”

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,160
I wish they’d say that about me.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
Anyway, Benedict Rogers has now set up

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,929
an organization called Hong Kong Watch

21
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,309
to monitor the Chinese Communist Party’s

22
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,050
encroachment on Hong Kong’s freedoms

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,010
and rule of law.

24
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,300
Under a treaty with Great Britain

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,100
called the Joint Declaration,

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,559
Hong Kong is supposed to be

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,649
independently governed until the year 2047.

28
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,660
But according to Mr. Rogers,

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,800
that’s not what’s happening.

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,750
So I traveled to Washington DC

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,041
to have a chat with him about

32
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,910
the future of Hong Kong and China.

33
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,050
Benedict, thank-you for joining us

34
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,760
in Washington DC.

35
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm very happy the US government

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,440
let you into the country.

37
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,860
I hear that doesn't always happen for you

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,540
in every country you visit.

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,540
That's right.

40
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,860
A few governments for reasons

41
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,510
I can't begin to imagine

42
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,870
have not let me into their countries.

43
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,450
I know, what you're talking about.

44
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,230
In October 11, 2017,

45
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,130
you were denied entry into Hong Kong.

46
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,420
Tell us a little bit about that.

47
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,540
About three days before I was due

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,180
to fly to Hong Kong from Bangkok

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,110
I received a phone call from a person in Britain.

50
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,930
A British person who I know well who's a friend,

51
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,320
who's sympathetic on these issues.

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,380
He had received a phone call

53
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,030
from the Chinese embassy telling him

54
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,160
that they had become aware of

55
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,500
my intended visit to Hong Kong,

56
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,060
and asking him to ask me not to go.

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,159
There was a to and fro of messages.

58
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,650
I took advice on what to do.

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,930
The advice from everyone I spoke to

60
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,610
was I should go ahead,

61
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,709
because essentially this was an attempt

62
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,459
to intimidate me into not going.

63
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,580
Did you not care at all about

64
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,340
the feelings of the Chinese people?

65
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,109
The Communist Party asked you not to go.

66
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,400
I care very much about the feelings

67
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,459
of the Chinese people.

68
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,540
I don't care so much about the feelings

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,939
of the Chinese Communist Party,

70
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,549
and the two are very different.

71
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,049
It was Chinese people that I was

72
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,629
seeking advice from who said,

73
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,980
"We want you to come.

74
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
We think probably this is an attempt

75
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,360
to intimidate you, and it's bluff.

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,269
Were you surprised when you got to Hong Kong

77
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,560
and they actually stopped you?

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,639
I was surprised.

79
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,329
Obviously I knew it was a possibility

80
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,769
from these warnings.

81
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,340
But I had hoped that in the end,

82
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,910
Hong Kong's autonomy would be intact.

83
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,170
Clearly it wasn't.

84
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,499
It seems like it really backfired on them,

85
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:04,379
because your story made international headlines.

86
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,440
Even Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam,

87
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,319
further dug a hole for herself by saying

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,529
at this point they would even consider banning

89
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:15,499
Hong Kong's former governor, Chris Patten.

90
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:16,499
That's right.

91
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,499
What was extraordinary was,

92
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:19,989
I think in news terms a story like this,

93
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,120
had it just been the denial of entry

94
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,239
to a British human rights activist,

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,239
serious enough.

96
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,599
But that story probably would have run

97
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,980
for a day or two and then the news cycle

98
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,269
would have moved on to other things.

99
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,019
But Carrie Lam kept the story going.

100
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,969
Did you send her a thank-you card, by the
way?

101
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,769
I have written to her.

102
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,159
Not exactly along those lines…

103
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,989
Hong Kong and China are supposed to

104
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,419
have this One Country Two Systems policy

105
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,139
where Hong Kong gets to keep its own freedoms

106
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,040
and rule of law.

107
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,859
Clearly that hasn't been going so well.

108
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,590
How long do you think until it will just be

109
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,180
a “One Country, One System”?

110
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,620
Well I think it's rapidly heading in that
direction…

111
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,290
"How long will it be?",

112
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,999
I think part of the answer is it depends on

113
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,099
the response of the international community,

114
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,409
and particularly my own country, Britain.

115
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,519
If Britain and the international community

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,870
take a stand for the principles set out

117
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,479
in a treaty actually between Britain and China,

118
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,120
the Joint Declaration,

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,090
then maybe we can hold off the day

120
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,360
when it just becomes another Chinese city.

121
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
But if the international community doesn't
act,

122
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,400
then that day will come sooner rather than
later.

123
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
You're British?

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,699
I couldn't tell.

125
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,360
My accent doesn't give it away.

126
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
A few weeks ago,

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,740
British Prime Minister, Theresa May,

128
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,360
made a trip to China.

129
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,199
Before the trip she said she would bring up

130
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,090
human rights issues in Hong Kong.

131
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,960
So, on a scale of 1 to 10,

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
how did she do?

133
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,919
I would say probably about four...

134
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,460
Downing Street did say before she went to
China

135
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,110
or when she was on her way

136
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,949
that she would raise these issues.

137
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,990
Of course, she only raised them privately...

138
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,150
It seems there's a problem

139
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,069
that when these issues are kept private,

140
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,690
it becomes sort of a propaganda boon

141
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,099
for the Communist Party...

142
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,930
It sort of sets a precedent to other people,

143
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,930
do you think?

144
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,139
Other politicians and even businesses,

145
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,500
that it's best to stay quiet if

146
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,979
the leaders of countries are not doing this.

147
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,639
It does set that precedent,

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,110
which I think is very dangerous.

149
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,770
I think that, of course there's also the precedent

150
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,300
of corporations giving in to China,

151
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,970
or even apologizing to China.

152
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,440
Mercedes Benz and Marriott.

153
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,700
Alright.

154
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,540
Name 20 more examples.

155
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Yes, exactly.

156
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,110
Yes, I very strongly favor having these

157
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,159
private discussions where you go into more
detail,

158
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,080
but making public statements as well.

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,770
I think, firstly

160
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,349
I think China needs to be confronted publicly.

161
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:52,349
But secondly,

162
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,389
I think for our own domestic audience at home,

163
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,509
that provides a level of accountability.

164
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,830
Do you think there is any meaningful change

165
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,840
the British government can make in Hong Kong?

166
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Yes.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,979
I think there definitely is.

168
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,480
Britain has both not only moral responsibilities,

169
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,389
but a legal responsibility under the

170
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,819
Sino-British Joint Declaration, which is a
-

171
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,200
Which they have called, I forget their exact
term,

172
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,030
but they called it some archaic historical
document

173
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,150
that has no relevance.

174
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
That's right.

175
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,759
Yes, the Chinese said that.

176
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,740
But I mean, that's wrong.

177
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
It's a living treaty.

178
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,800
It's valid for the first 50 years after the
handover.

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,699
It's lodged at the United Nations.

180
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,080
I think the challenge for the international
community is,

181
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,250
if China takes that view over one particular
treaty,

182
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,069
what does it mean for all its other treaty
obligations?

183
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,900
Tell us a little bit more about your organization,

184
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,540
Hong Kong Watch…

185
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,690
Essentially a group of us came together in
London,

186
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,409
very concerned about the shockingly low level

187
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,979
of awareness in our own parliament,

188
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:59,419
and among our own public,

189
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,300
about what's happening to Hong Kong.

190
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,560
We felt there was a need for an advocacy organization

191
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,030
to speak out for Hong Kong...

192
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,219
We exist to speak out.

193
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,410
To carry out research into the

194
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,669
erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong,

195
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,069
and to provide a voice to inform and educate

196
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,310
and advocate for Hong Kong.

197
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,189
Well considering you're doing this,

198
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,970
do you think you'll ever get back into Hong
Kong?

199
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,069
I hope so.

200
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:33,349
I think it would be a positive sign if that
happens.

201
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,500
But there have been three attempts

202
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,039
to get the Hong Kong government

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,250
to give an answer to this question.

204
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,840
The British government minister, Mark Field,

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,969
wrote to Carrie Lam.

206
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,099
The lawyer Albert Ho

207
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,550
wrote to the director of immigration.

208
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,610
Then I personally wrote to Carrie Lam.

209
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,039
On all three occasions

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,610
the response is ambiguous at best.

211
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,909
I guess more importantly,

212
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,819
do you think I even can go back to Hong Kong.

213
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,169
Well, that's a good question.

214
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,749
Having interviewed me you really might not
be.

215
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,499
You and the master criminal Joshua Wong.

216
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:06,509
Exactly.

217
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,130
Well if we ever are able to go back to Hong
Kong

218
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,139
at the same time,

219
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,389
I know a great place that serves basically

220
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,729
macaroni and cheese with a slice of pig cheek.

221
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,729
Oh.

222
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,379
It's out of this world.

223
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,379
That sounds excellent.

224
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,860
Well thank-you very much for joining us today.

225
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,640
Best of luck with Hong Kong Watch.

226
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,200
Thank-you very much.

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,740

228
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,500
