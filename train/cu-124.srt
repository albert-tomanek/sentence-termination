1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,520
China’s economy is doing great!

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,600
At least, according to China.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
That’s why foreign investors\h

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,920
Should give China their money.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.\h

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,360
Last week Chinese officials released\h
their third quarter GDP figures—measuring\h\h

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,560
how well the Chinese economy has\h
done in the last three months.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,760
Earlier this year, China’s economy\h
shrank for the first time in decades.\h

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,880
That was of course because of the\h
Communist Party’s coronavirus lockdown.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
But while the Chinese economy may\h
have been down in the first quarter,\h\h

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
it is back with a rebound in the third.\h

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
Yes, China’s economy bounces back.\h

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,880
It surges ahead.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
And it’s a slam dunk! I mean,\h
it’s the envy of the world.\h

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,920
Sorry, I got carried away\h
with the sports metaphors.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,840
Anyway, China’s economy looks great. “China\h
posted 4.9% economic growth in its third quarter\h\h

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
compared to the same period last year.”

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,840
If you believe the official numbers.\h

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,040
And there’s the catch. After the Chinese\h
government released their third quarter numbers,\h\h

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,840
analysts began to see signs of\h
“apparent data manipulation.”

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
For example, “China recorded growth of 0.8%\h\h

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,680
in fixed-asset investment for the first three\h
quarters of the year, compared with 2019,\h\h

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,240
but the absolute figures for the same period\h
showed a drop of several trillion yuan.”

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,680
What does that mean? Well, according to\h
the chief executive of China Beige Book,\h\h

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,120
the Chinese government essentially\h
made 2.5 *trillion* yuan in investment\h\h

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,280
disappear from last year’s books to make\h
it look like investment grew this year.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
But would the Chinese Communist\h
Party really manipulate statistics\h\h

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
to get the results they want?\h\h
I know, it’s hard to believe.\h

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
These analysts aren’t saying that the Chinese\h
economy isn’t recovering. It obviously is,\h\h

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,960
since people can actually leave their house\h
and go back to work and travel now. They’re\h\h

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,920
just saying it may not be recovering as fast as\h
Chinese officials would like everyone to believe.\h

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,880
But these Debbie Downers don’t really matter.\h
Because the Chinese Communist Party already\h\h

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,640
got those blockbuster headlines from foreign\h
media about how great China’s economy is doing.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,360
And China wants to make it\h
clear to foreign investors:\h\h

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
We’re open for business. And\h
we’re ready for your money.\h

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
And I’ll tell you how you can make\h
lots of money in China after the break.

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,880
Welcome back. The Chinese Communist\h
Party wants foreign investors to know,\h\h

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,800
China is open for business!

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Last weekend, the Bund Summit was held\h
in Shanghai. It’s billed as “an open,\h\h

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
pragmatic and internationally influential\h
financial high-end communication\h\h

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,320
platform” that promotes “China’s financial\h
opening-up and global economic development”.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,800
And it was part of China’s charm\h
offensive to woo foreign investors.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,920
“One key message China is trying\h
to deliver is that it is committed\h\h

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,960
to deepening its economic and financial\h
ties with the rest of the world even\h\h

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,840
though relations between Beijing and Washington\h
have plunged to their lowest level in decades.”

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Hey, we may not like you, but\h
we still want your money.\h

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,600
And in a sign of how important\h
this Shanghai Bund Summit was,\h\h

48
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,000
Chinese vice president and Xi Jinping’s\h
right-hand man Wang Qishan made an appearance.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,400
Wang told the attendees that “Win-win cooperation\h
is the only right choice for the world.”

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Ah yes, win-win cooperation.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,440
And in case that wasn’t clear enough of a message,\h\h

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,360
the head of China’s central bank Yi Gang\h
said in his speech that “International\h\h

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
investors entering China can share the\h
dividends of China’s growth and reform.”

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,520
Did we mention that we really,\h
really want your money?\h

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
Now this isn’t completely\h
new. Starting two years ago,\h\h

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,920
Chinese officials have been making it easier\h
for foreign investors to invest money in China.\h\h

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Like letting them own financial institutions\h
in China and letting them buy Chinese bonds.\h

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
But the Bund Summit, which\h
is only in its second year,\h\h

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,240
is a sign of how much the Chinese regime\h
wants to turn Shanghai into a financial hub.\h

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
High-profile attendees included\h
a former British prime minister;\h\h

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,520
two former US treasury secretaries; the\h
former head of the European central bank;\h\h

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,480
and the former director general of the WTO.\h

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Big investment banks like Goldman Sachs\h
and HSBC were also there. And they seemed\h\h

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
pretty receptive to the ‘we\h
want your money’ message.\h

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
“Noel Quinn, chief executive of HSBC,\h\h

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,840
said the bank’s commitment to mainland China ‘is\h
unwavering even in today’s challenging time.’”

67
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,160
Meanwhile “John Waldron, president and chief\h
operating officer at Goldman Sachs, told the forum\h\h

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,120
that the US bank was ‘encouraged by the enhanced\h
access China [is] providing foreign firms.’”

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,640
Waldron did have some suggestions though. Like\h\h

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,840
China should make it easier for\h
people to move money out of China.\h\h

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
And “Align Chinese regulation with international\h
norms to bolster investors’ confidence.”

72
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Ok, if you’ve watched our previous episode\h
on why China is running out of dollars,\h\h

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,480
you know that they’re not going to make it\h
easier for people to move money out of China.

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,600
But to be fair, they do want to\h
regulate financial markets better.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,600
In his speech at the Bund Summit, Wang\h
Qishan said that the financial sector\h\h

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
should avoid the “wrong paths” of\h
speculation, bubbles and Ponzi schemes.

77
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Wang also sought to reassure investors about\h
how safe China’s financial industry is.\h\h

78
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
He said, “Of the [financial] industry’s\h
three key principles—security,\h\h

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
liquidity and effectiveness—the\h
most important is always security.”

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,840
We want your money, but don’t\h
worry, it’s safe with us.

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Now, it’s good that China wants to avoid\h
speculation, bubbles, and Ponzi schemes. It’s\h\h

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,760
had a lot of trouble with all three things.\h

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,880
But the second part of Wang’s message,\h
about how safe investing in China is,\h\h

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,400
is actually part of the reason that China has\h
so much speculation, bubbles, and Ponzi schemes.

85
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,880
People assume that when China’s stock market\h
goes crazy, or when the real estate bubble\h\h

86
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,600
gets too big, the Chinese Communist Party will\h
always step in. Because they want stability.

87
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
And they do. That’s why some people have\h
called China the bubble that never pops.

88
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,160
But in some ways, the Chinese Communist\h
Party is actually operating the biggest\h\h

89
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
Ponzi scheme of all on foreign investors.\h

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
And I’ll show you how after the break.

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Welcome back. The Chinese\h
Communist Party is operating a\h\h

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,040
vast Ponzi scheme on foreign investors.\h

93
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,160
It goes like this: The Chinese government always\h
gives the impression that its economy is growing.\h\h

94
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
Even if that takes some fudging of the numbers.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,360
The Chinese Communist Party lures in\h
the first round of foreign investors\h\h

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
by showing them how much money\h
they can make in the China market.

97
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,080
These investors then influence\h
others to invest in China too.\h

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,440
A lot of them are institutions that hold average\h
Americans’ 401(k)s and other investment money.\h\h

99
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,880
Which means a lot of us are invested\h
in China, even if we don’t want to be.

100
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,160
The big investors also convince foreign\h
governments to play nice with China,\h\h

101
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
so they can keep doing business there.

102
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,680
And meanwhile all of this money is\h
pumping up China’s economy and the CCP.

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Which then lures in more\h
investors, and rinse and repeat.\h

104
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Like in any Ponzi scheme, some\h
of the investors will win.

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,760
But eventually, most investors will lose.\h
We just don’t really hear about the losers.

106
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,440
It’s like what happened with foreign companies\h
20 years ago. The Chinese government told them,\h\h

107
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,840
“Come to China, you can sell your\h
products here and make money!”

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,000
Some of these foreign companies\h
won big, like Apple and McDonalds.

109
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,960
Some of them lost everything.

110
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,480
Here’s an example of how China uses\h
investors to bring others in. Last week,\h\h

111
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,200
hedge fund manager Ray Dalio wrote a piece in the\h
Financial Times called “Don’t be blind to China’s\h\h

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,960
rise in a changing world. Anti-Beijing bias has\h
blinded too many for too long to opportunities.”

113
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Dalio, by the way, was a keynote\h
speaker at the Bund Summit in Shanghai.

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,960
He starts off by talking about how well China\h
has succeeded, using official Chinese numbers.

115
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,360
Then he says China succeeded even though people\h
have said China can’t succeed. These people say\h\h

116
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,440
“Communism doesn’t work. Authoritarianism\h
doesn’t work. The Chinese aren’t creative.”

117
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,720
Look, communism doesn’t work. And authoritarianism\h\h

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,480
doesn’t create long-term stability. But I’ve\h
never said Chinese people aren’t creative.\h\h

119
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,600
I would never say that. I’ve seen Chinese\h
farmers make homemade rocket launchers.\h

120
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,800
Anyway, Dalio’s point is that we all need\h
to check our “persistent anti-China bias.”

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
What kind of anti-China bias?

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,200
“[China] produces and collects vastly more\h
data to process with artificial intelligence.\h\h

123
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
For many in the west, this has a dark\h
side in terms of state surveillance.”

124
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,480
But if you take off your anti-China\h
bias glasses, it’s not so bad after all.

125
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,160
Because “For many Chinese it reinforces\h\h

126
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,400
positive social norms while also\h
promising vast efficiencies.”

127
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,280
Wow, when can we get state surveillance!?

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,920
And ok, Americans don’t like what the Chinese\h
Communist Party is doing to the Uyghurs.

129
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,880
But if you take off your anti-China bias glasses,\h\h

130
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,840
“China’s rejoinder is that a strong\h
hand is needed to maintain order,\h\h

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,760
what happens inside its borders is its business,\h
and the US has its own human rights problems.”

132
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,960
No wonder this guy thinks\h
that authoritarianism works.\h

133
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,560
Anyway, the point of this entire article is\h
that Dalio invests in China and you should\h\h

134
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
too. You don’t want to miss out\h
because of your anti-China bias.

135
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,360
“China’s fundamentals are strong, its\h
assets relatively attractively priced,\h\h

136
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,320
and the world is underweight\h
Chinese stocks and bonds.\h\h

137
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
This discrepancy is at least in\h
part due to anti-Chinese bias.”

138
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Dalio’s message aligns pretty\h
well with the Chinese Communist\h\h

139
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,840
Party’s message to foreign investors:\h
Anti-China bias is bad. Greed is good.\h

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,480
So as foreign investment increases in China,\h
it’s not just the bubble that never pops.\h\h

141
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,760
It’s the Ponzi scheme that never collapses.\h\h

142
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,040
As long as the Chinese Communist Party keeps\h
finding more investors to keep it going.

143
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,960
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

144
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,240
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

145

Ringleader asks: hey Chris, what ever happened\h
to the fake gold issue that hit China in June?

146
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:20,640
Oh boy, talk about a crazy Chinese scam. Back\h
in June, Caixin magazine reported that a Chinese\h\h

147
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,480
jewelry company called Kingold had taken out\h
more than 2 billion dollars worth of loans.\h

148
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
And those loans were backed by fake gold.\h

149
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,920
“At least some of 83 tons of\h
gold bars used as loan collateral\h\h

150
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
turned out to be nothing but gilded copper.”

151
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,560
This was a huge deal. “Kingold is the\h
largest privately owned gold processor\h\h

152
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,280
in central China’s Hubei province. Its shares are\h
listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York.”

153
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Kingold’s CEO used to be in the\h
Chinese People’s Liberation Army.

154
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,560
Also, Kingold had borrowed money\h
from more than a dozen companies\h\h

155
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,080
and had taken insurance out on the loans, too.

156
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,560
After this story broke, Chinese\h
authorities started looking into Kingold.

157
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,160
But as far as I can tell,\h
they’re still investigating.

158
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,840
And after their stock fell dramatically,\h\h

159
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Kingold had to delist from the Nasdaq\h
stock exchange back in August.\h

160
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,680
Now after dropping almost 95%,\h
Kingold shares are at 15 cents each.

161
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,800
Sounds like a steal. Heeey foreign investors...

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Thanks for your question, Ringleader.\h

163

your question or comment on the show for\h\h

164
