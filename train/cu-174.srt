1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,100
The Chinese regime has teamed up with international
criminal cartels

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,189
to pump the West full of drugs

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,410
and dirty money.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:18,760
And it’s all happening right under our government’s
nose

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:35,220
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,290
The Chinese Communist Party is at war with
the West.

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,270
This isn’t a 20th century boots on the ground
kind of warfare.

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,530
China has brought war into the 21st century
through a massive, coordinated campaign of

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:54,979
global terror, using links to triads and our
own politicians’ greed to undermine democracy.

10
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,239
Joining me today to talk about this is Sam
Cooper.

11
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,290
He’s an award winning Canadian investigative
journalist and author of the new book Wilful

12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,580
Blindness: How a network of narcos, tycoons
and CCP agents Infiltrated the West.

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,540
Sam, thanks for joining me today.

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,180
Thanks for having me.

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,140
Your book is Willful Blindness: How a Network
of Narcos, Tycoons and CCP agents Infiltrated

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,170
the West.

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:29,140
So tell us, how did a network of narcos, tycoons
and CCP agents infiltrate the West?

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,320
It's a very complex story.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,860
But to simplify it, really, this starts in
Hong Kong.

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,770
My a book gets into a corruption case that
happened in Canada's High Commission.

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,140
Tycoons that are very powerful and tight in
Hong Kong, and connected to drug and casino

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,840
money laundering triads, wanted to immigrate
to Canada.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,130
They were able to allegedly corrupt Canadian
officials and immigrate and invest, especially

24
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,250
in the city of Vancouver.

25
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,300
Their connections were both to the Chinese
Communist Party at a high level, for political

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,720
reasons, and to drug traffickers.

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,160
They used casinos to launder money.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,170
They used British Columbia casinos brazenly,
egregious money laundering.

29
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,110
We're talking bags of cash.

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,490
Hockey bags with from 500,000 to a million
dollars in $20 bills.

31
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,640
This was a way for corruption suspects to
get money out of China using organized crime

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
underground banking.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,500
But there was also a scheme where intelligence
agents were using organized crime.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,459
So you can see when money flows out of China,
it's not just corruption involved.

35
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:49,370
There was a level of espionage with the ultimate
goal of influencing Canadian politics and

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:56,390
using Canada's economy to get a foothold really
for Chinese state activity in the West.

37
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,239
This is the Chinese Communist Party actively
using connections to its business elite's

38
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:11,030
underground triads to pump money into the
West through drugs and human trafficking,

39
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,420
that's also part of this as well, and influencing
Canadian politicians.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,280
That's right.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,420
In a boiled down nutshell, organized crime
is working hand in hand with the Chinese Communist

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,819
Party.

43
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:31,130
My book showed examples of people who, on
the one hand, are alleged gangsters and also

44
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,900
involved in intelligence activity.

45
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,450
Also involved in, at least on the surface,
what is put forward as a legitimate business

46
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,450
activity.

47
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,300
So when you have people of great wealth that
have established themselves in Hong Kong and

48
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,130
are being used in a symbiotic sort of dark
alliance by the party in Beijing, this leads

49
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,769
to opportunities to influence Western politicians,
to donate money to Western political parties,

50
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:05,940
to try to control diasporic communities in
cities like Vancouver and Toronto to the extent

51
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,960
where you have people that are, to use a simple
term, being run through Chinese consulate

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,209
officials, working together with casino money
laundering gangs to rub shoulders with Canadian

53
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,209
politicians.

54
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:27,610
In the darkest cases, the same people I found
were harassing or politically opposing democracy

55
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,669
activists, Hong Kong Canadians, Chinese Canadian
dissidents, Uighurs, members of the Falun

56
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,770
Gong societies in Canada.

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,610
Not only does the Chinese government know
about this, but the Canadian government does

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,089
as well.

59
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,470
That's a difficult one.

60
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,729
On the casino money laundering and organized
crime side, what my book shows is, indeed,

61
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,139
there was willful blindness.

62
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,210
There had to be.

63
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,699
The police knew about these hockey bags of
cash coming into casinos.

64
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,629
They knew that it was coming through the hands
of persons who were loan sharks, persons who

65
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:09,169
were high-level drug traffickers under investigation,
while either lending money or themselves high

66
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,610
rolling inside, for example, the Richmond
River Rock Casino.

67
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,050
These are known high-level, organized crime
RCMP targets.

68
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:25,210
This was known by everyone, from people working
in the casinos, to police, to high-level government

69
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,210
officials.

70
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,900
It was known that this was seen to be by the
good investigators as high-level drug money

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,229
laundering using B.C. Casinos.

72
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,229
It was allowed to happen.

73
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,970
Is the intelligence side of this operation
allowed to happen?

74
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,000
My book didn't get into that level of willful
blindness.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,560
But it's reasonable to believe that the people...

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,449
There are politicians in Canada that understand
that they're dealing with gangsters and people

77
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,830
from other governments asking them to act
against their country's interests.

78
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,919
So at some level, the intelligence organized
crime influence nexus is known in Canada among

79
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,960
politicians, among regulators.

80
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,639
How did you get started writing this book?

81
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,999
I got started writing this book, I have to
take a step back and look at the days when

82
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:26,229
I was a young journalism student, back in
2005 at Langara College in Vancouver studying

83
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,270
the craft of journalism.

84
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,180
I saw the downtown east side, which literally
is war zone conditions, where thousands of

85
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,660
addicts are clinging onto life.

86
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:45,819
They are in many cases, of course, on government
subsidies that unfortunately in many cases

87
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,069
are spent immediately on heroin or fentanyl.

88
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,649
I couldn't understand that scenario in Vancouver.

89
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,289
How is this happening in a Western city?

90
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,090
How has this open-air drug market allowed
to continue?

91
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,800
I couldn't figure it out.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,699
Then I started to look at real estate in Vancouver.

93
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,550
Why were the prices just so far out of reach
of the average incomes?

94
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,879
Why is this the super capital, sorry, the
capital of super cars in North America, Lamborghinis,

95
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,649
Ferraris, McLarens, when people aren't declaring
incomes to compare with other big cities in

96
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,949
Canada or the United States?

97
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:29,069
And the answer was, this has become a medical
hub where there's so much narcotics flowing

98
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:34,319
in from offshore, so much addiction, so much
money laundering has to occur.

99
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,149
That had to have an influence on housing prices.

100
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,719
I looked into those issues.

101
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,379
Started to put them together.

102
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:48,330
And this is what led me to sort of these higher-level
later investigations where I saw that the

103
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,500
intelligence angle from other countries, such
as China and Iran, using organized crime in

104
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,779
cities like Vancouver and Toronto was very
present.

105
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,870
I imagine this must've been shocking for you
to uncover.

106
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:09,479
I never stopped being shocked, from those
moments in 2005, as a young student, looking

107
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,860
at the devastation of the downtown east side.

108
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,330
Look, paramedics are trained.

109
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:21,840
They take war zone training to work out of
ambulances in the downtown east side of Vancouver,

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,689
because this is the epicenter of death related
to heroin.

111
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:26,689
And now fentanyl.

112
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,009
I couldn't understand it.

113
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,029
That was shocking.

114
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,659
Real estate prices, I couldn't understand
it.

115
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:41,100
Going fast forward to 2015, hockey bags of
cash, $500,000 openly coming into the casino

116
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
night after night.

117
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,640
This doesn't happen, even in Las Vegas.

118
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,280
It doesn't happen in Macau.

119
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,970
Why is it happening in Vancouver?

120
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,700
Canada, a supposedly upright country with
the rule of law.

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,270
It didn't make sense.

122
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,380
So by 2017, when I'm starting to look at,
let's just say, a high-level People's Liberation

123
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:07,800
Army veteran, known to be a high-level organized
crime suspect, and yet meeting with Canadian

124
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,550
politicians, very chummy with Chinese consulate
officials, it doesn't make sense.

125
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,580
How is this happening on the west coast of
Canada, where we have this nexus of organized

126
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,550
crime and Chinese state actors?

127
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,690
How is this activity explained?

128
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,590
I still can't explain why this is occurring
in Canada.

129
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,670
I can say it is occurring.

130
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,650
The line is so blurry between triad member,
PLA member and Communist Party member.

131
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,610
I talk a lot about unrestricted warfare or
asymmetrical warfare.

132
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,750
And from everything you're telling me, this
really sounds like this is the kind of drug

133
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:52,490
warfare they're talking about, or even how
the housing prices are being through the roof.

134
00:09:52,490 --> 00:10:00,820
It really seems like this is an aspect of
this sort of asymmetric warfare.

135
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,140
People have different levels of comfort looking
at the concept of gray zone conflict or hostile

136
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,470
state activity just below armed conflict,
kinetic war.

137
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,530
Do states, such as Iran and China, use these
asymmetric tactics?

138
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:26,070
I would argue that it's hard to argue a level
of total strategic control in countries such

139
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,600
as China and Iran.

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,660
But I do think there is the pattern of states
such as China using activities that are harmful

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:44,060
to other countries, perhaps allowing or not
cracking down on factories producing fentanyl,

142
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,010
because China is making so much money from
the production of pharmaceuticals.

143
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,330
There are a corrupt officials in China that
are doing business with drug gangs.

144
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,170
There are corrupt officials that are making
tremendous amounts of money in trade-based

145
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,170
money laundering.

146
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,230
China's economy, making so much money from
all of this rolled together, that why would

147
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,350
they crack down on it?

148
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,400
My sources in intelligence or the police would
say, "If they're not cooperating with Canada..."

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,990
When Canada goes to them and says, "Can you
work with us on fentanyl trafficking?"

150
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,550
And China says, "Well, maybe if you let us
put in our agents to go after our economic

151
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,220
fugitives, we'll work with you."

152
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,250
And Canada says, "I'm sorry, we can't allow
that covert fox hunt activity to occur in

153
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,250
our country."

154
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,440
And China says, "Okay, then no help on fentanyl."

155
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
What do we have here?

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,350
This is a hostage diplomacy-style of state
activity.

157
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,240
So are they directing those shipments of fentanyl
to cities in Canada and the United States,

158
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Australia?

159
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,780
I don't know that level of direct warfare
is happening.

160
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,450
I do know an omission of enforcement is happening
to China and why.

161
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,860
What is being done about this problem?

162
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,630
Are Canadian officials doing anything now
that your book has come out?

163
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,250
Well, the book's only been out for less than
two weeks.

164
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,320
I can say that it's starting to make some
waves.

165
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,080
People in law enforcement and, of course,
intelligence are taking it very seriously.

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,340
Here's the rub.

167
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,440
Some would say Canada's government hasn't
been taking people in intelligence and law

168
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,870
enforcement themselves seriously.

169
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:35,130
This gets into the question of, why is the
concept of a 5G network run by Huawei still

170
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,320
a possibility in Canada, when countries such
as Australia and United States have completely

171
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,560
ruled it out?

172
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm optimistic that my book, it has the chance
to open up the eyes of mainstream readers,

173
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,950
if you will, and for them to start talking
to their local politician and saying, "Why

174
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,070
aren't you acting on what looks like very
serious issues?"

175
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,590
You would hope once that starts to happen,
that politicians, high-level politicians,

176
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,830
in Ottawa, Canada's federal government, do
start to take actions.

177
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,530
But I have to say, we're in a position where
countries such as Australia and the United

178
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:20,760
States, I'm told they're about a decade ahead
of Canada in terms of dealing with this, first

179
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,390
of all, interference from countries such as
Iran in China, and this nexus of organized

180
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,130
crime working with state actors in countries
such as China and Iran.

181
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,230
I bet that really affects the security dialogue
between Canada and most of the other Five

182
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,720
Eyes countries.

183
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,590
That's undeniable.

184
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,790
My sources would say, "Canada is starting
to look like not a great partner."

185
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,440
It's not due to the police.

186
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,750
It's not due to CSIS.

187
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:57,070
When they're supported, when they have their
best leadership in place, these are leading

188
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,010
international agencies.

189
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,410
But Canada, for reasons that come from the
ground up, or maybe the top down, doesn't

190
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,130
seem to be pulling its weight in intelligence
and law enforcement internationally.

191
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,110
I think that's a huge problem.

192
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,430
Let me give you an example.

193
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,710
Canada's former top police intelligence official
is now being accused of working with some

194
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,480
of the worst gangsters and drug traffickers
in the world, profiting from helping them

195
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
evade detection.

196
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,240
This would be a form of protection of gangsters
that we might expect in a country like China.

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,670
It's happening in Canada, allegedly.

198
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,880
Was this person, Mr. Ortis, perhaps working
for hostile states as well to misdirect Canada's

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,960
policing investigations, to misdirect our
intelligence?

200
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,180
That's an open question.

201
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,110
His case remains to be tried.

202
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,130
Yet the allegations would, it just follows
that Australia and the United States would

203
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,440
start to hold on to their cards.

204
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,500
They'd start to hold on to their high-side
intel and not share with Canada.

205
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
So it's a problem.

206
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Absolutely.

207
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,250
Well, Sam, the book is an absolutely fascinating
read.

208
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,900
