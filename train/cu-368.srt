1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:04,190
The CCP Coronavirus could be a “Regime Ender”

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,010
for the Chinese Communist Party.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,049
Find Out How Economic Turmoil

4
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,220
Might bring down the regime

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,020
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,230
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,230
The deadly coronavirus outbreak.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,740
I’m calling it the “CCP coronavirus”,

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,019
or just “CCP Virus” for short—

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,620
since the Chinese Communist Party is to blame

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,660
for letting it spread in the first place.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,820
Of course, nowhere has the CCP Virus had

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,710
a more devastating impact than inside China.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,570
And the Chinese Communist Party is concerned—

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,180
not so much about all the people that have
died from it,

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,440
but about the economic downturn it’s led
to.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,420
It could be a fatal blow to their rule.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,899
I sat down over Skype—

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,950
you know, because of the quarantine—

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,420
with China expert Gordon Chang to discuss

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,940
what might be next for the Chinese Communist
Party.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,480
Thanks for joining me today.

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,489
Thank you so much, Chris.

24
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,350
Yeah, how's a life under the Coronavirus?

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,930
I see you're holed up at home?

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,410
We're under a mandatory lockdown in New Jersey,

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,780
and we're surviving fine.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,430
Ah, glad to hear that.

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,240
Well, so Gordon, the Coronavirus basically

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,750
shut down the Chinese economy for two months.

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,690
What impact do you think that had?

32
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm sure that the first quarter is going to
be

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,360
negative gross domestic product growth.

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,110
I'm sure China is going to report something
positive.

35
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,340
But nonetheless, when you start to look at
the underlying numbers,

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,560
it shows an economy deep in the red.

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,700
So for instance, oil demand was down 20% year
on year.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,550
The exports for the combined January/February
period, down 17.2%.

39
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,840
Imports, a crucial measure of domestic demand,
down 4.0%.

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,610
The purchasing managers indices for February

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,320
were historically negative,

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,760
both for manufacturing, but especially for
services.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,119
So March, there might be a recovery of some
sort.

44
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,080
But even so, Chris, you have for instance
only about an average

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,640
of maybe 70% of the workers back at the job
sites.

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,430
So March probably is negative as well.

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,830
So, the first quarter is, I think,

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,330
a really big hole for China.

49
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,770
Well, I know China has a history of lying
about its GDP numbers.

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,480
So these are some of the things we can look
at to get

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,290
a better sense of how the Chinese economy
is actually doing.

52
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,400
And, now I know China has required people
to go back to work.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,430
Is trying to get the economy going again.

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,060
Do you think that will work ?

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,690
Well, I'm sure that they will have some sort
of recovery

56
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,849
in this month, March,

57
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,880
and we're going to see it continue through
April.

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,690
But we've got to remember the issue here is
that the virus

59
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,490
has not completely subsided in China.

60
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,099
There are many unreported cases from all that
we can tell,

61
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,459
which means that as workers get back to the
job site,

62
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,050
there's going to be re-infections.

63
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,390
And there's evidence of that in Dongguan,

64
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,640
which is the industrial heart of Guangdong
Province.

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,269
When workers came back to their factory sites,

66
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,660
they were actually infecting each other,

67
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,239
so they had to go into quarantine

68
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,080
or into hospital as the case may be.

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,720
So, this is going to be a much slower process
than Beijing

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,210
has been trying to show to the rest of the
world.

71
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,560
Beijing wants to say, oh, China's back.

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,220
Well, it's sort of back,

73
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,560
but it's going to take a long time, Chris.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,490
So what will happen if there is a second wave

75
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,250
of the Coronavirus in China?

76
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,610
Well, I think you're going to see

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,130
something like we witnessed in January and
February.

78
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,879
It may not be as bad, but we're already starting
to see,

79
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,000
the wave of re-infections.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,489
Beijing's numbers for the last five or six
days

81
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,209
show almost all the cases are, as they say,

82
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,209
imported.

83
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,769
There's only been one case of local transmission

84
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,710
in the last week or so.

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,230
And that case came from somebody who was imported.

86
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,580
But that's pretty unlikely,

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,950
because we're getting indications from Wuhan,

88
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,489
which is the epicenter,

89
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,100
that there are dozens of infections there.

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,039
And also, even in Beijing there were clusters,

91
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,930
which I think the government and the party

92
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,849
have been trying to hide.

93
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,960
So, this is going to be a really difficult
process for China,

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
because they're going to have to deal with

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,439
two things at the same time.

96
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,619
They're going to have to deal with getting
people back to work,

97
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,029
but they're also going to have to deal with

98
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,550
the virus spreading fast again.

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,740
And we know that there's a second wave of
infections in Asia.

100
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,789
It's Taiwan, it's Hong Kong, it's to a lesser
extent Singapore,

101
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,080
and we're going to see it in China as well.

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,699
What impact will this have on the rule

103
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,729
of the Chinese communist party?

104
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,669
I think long term, this is maybe a regime
ender for the party.

105
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,430
We saw, for instance, in February

106
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,720
at the death of one of the Wuhan eight,

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,629
the eight doctors who were whistleblowers,

108
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,930
that created a wave of white hot anger

109
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,970
across social media platforms.

110
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,090
People were demanding fundamental political
reform.

111
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,090
Since that time,

112
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,409
we have seen people in Wuhan go to their balconies,

113
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:19,449
and even disrupt a inspection tour by a vice
premier.

114
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,180
They've been now singing,

115
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,509
Do You Hear The People Sing?,

116
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,259
that politically impactful song from Les Miserables,

117
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,990
which by the way is what people in Hong Kong

118
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,810
adopted as their anthem in protest of China.

119
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,899
So, it's very clear what's going on.

120
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,449
People in China are talking about Chernobyl.

121
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,550
So, I think this is going to really create
a period of friction,

122
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,839
and especially after the virus subsides,

123
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,819
people are going to engage in recriminations.

124
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,060
They're going to start complaining.

125
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,089
And remember,

126
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,789
this is the revolutionary season in China.

127
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:52,999
It's spring.

128
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,719
What impact will this have on the global economy?

129
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,789
A lot of Western countries and businesses

130
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,719
are still heavily invested in China.

131
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,719
Yeah.

132
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,619
One of the things that's really bad news for
China

133
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:05,330
is that it's traditional export markets have
been hit heavily.

134
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,930
So for instance, the U.S. Large portions of
the U.S. are in lockdown.

135
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,240
The economy is in standstill in many places.

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,300
U.S. economy is going to have a horrible first
quarter.

137
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,569
We're going to be negative.

138
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,319
And that's also true, of course,

139
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,319
in Europe,

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,110
another big export destination for China.

141
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,979
You have Italy, Spain, now France, Germany.

142
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,210
These are places that are also coming to a
halt.

143
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,330
So it's going to be hard for China to dig
itself out

144
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,979
with an export dominated economy.

145
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,479
And that means that for China it's going to
be hard.

146
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,229
But, of course, that means everywhere around
the world

147
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,960
with some exceptions, I think,

148
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,210
are going to show some effect of a downturn.

149
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,459
And that means we're going to see that global
recession

150
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,039
that people talk about.

151
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,470
And Chris, people in our country

152
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,819
are talking about Great Depression Two.

153
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,789
And although I don't know if that's really
going to be the case,

154
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,069
nonetheless, more and more people have been
talking about that.

155
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,490
Well I know a lot of Americans are invested
in China

156
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,379
without necessarily even knowing it,

157
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,349
like with pension funds.

158
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,020
What can Americans do to avoid the China market?

159
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,679
Well, there's one American who can do everything.

160
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,789
President Trump can use his emergency powers
to get,

161
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,139
for instance the federal pension funds,

162
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,999
to get their money out of China

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,589
and he can actually get other institutions

164
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,759
out of China as well.

165
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,419
And I think we really need to do that,

166
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,949
because this is just outrageous.

167
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,120
A number of these Chinese companies

168
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,500
are on the Commerce Department's entity list,

169
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,830
which means Americans can't contract with
them

170
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,770
without getting prior approval from Commerce.

171
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,209
Yet, we can all invest in these Chinese companies,

172
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,520
which have been deemed threats

173
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,740
to the U.S. National security interests.

174
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,080
This makes no sense whatsoever,

175
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,789
and I think that we are going to have a pulling
