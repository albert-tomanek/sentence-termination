00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,820
how the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,720
“liberates” women.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,700
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,750
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,180
March 8 was International Women's Day.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,500
According to the UN,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,610
it's a time "to reflect on progress made,

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,440
to call for change and to celebrate acts of
courage

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,250
and determination by ordinary women."

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,689
Which explains why last year in China,

12
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:30,972
they celebrated the holiday last year

13
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,800
by seeing how fast people could undo the bras

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,980
of complete strangers.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,240
Hey, standing in your underwear in front of
a crowd

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,460
is definitely an act of courage and determination.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,239
I should know.

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,540
Quick historical note here,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,549
before the UN adopted it in the 1970s,

20
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,960
International Women's Day

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,589
actually started as a socialist holiday,

22
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,949
and then a communist holiday.

23
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:55,949
So in China,

24
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,350
it was first celebrated after the communists
founded

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,370
the People's Republic.

26
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,239
Back when the well-known feminist,

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,180
Chairman Mao Zedong, famously proclaimed,

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,430
"women hold up half the sky."

29
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,230
Anyway, I've been looking forward to seeing

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,500
what crazy ways China celebrated women's day

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,230
this year.

32
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,230
For more on this,

33
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,030
we go to China Uncensored female person,

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,350
Shelley Zhang.

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,010
Thanks, Chris.

36
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,170
One thing I've always wondered.

37
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,620
Why do women in China only get a half day
off of work

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,210
for women's day?

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,250
I'm not sure, Chris.

40
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,450
Maybe if women held up the entire sky,

41
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,130
we'd actually get an entire day off.

42
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,260
That's a good point.

43
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,460
Women do need to work harder.

44
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,250
But back to the important part.

45
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,840
How did Chinese state-run media embarrass
themselves

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
this year?

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,380
Well, sorry to disappoint you,

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,030
but there wasn't anything really crazy.

49
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,070
I guess after the foreign media last year

50
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,300
made fun of things like husbands dressing
up like punching bags

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,390
or guys walking up a mountain in heels,

52
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,200
Chinese media didn't want to do the same thing

53
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
this year.

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,380
Are you saying that relentless mocking

55
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,620
can change things for the better?

56
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,720
You tell me, Chris.

57
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,430
You're the one who started China Uncensored.

58
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,990
Anyway, I can't say for sure that no comically
sexist events

59
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,569
were held to celebrate women's day,

60
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,349
I can only say that state-run media

61
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,519
didn't report extensively on any.

62
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,360
The People's Daily even refrained from posting
slideshows

63
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,920
of beautiful, scantily clad women,

64
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,720
which is a big step up for them.

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,129
I am impressed.

66
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,690
So state-run media learned their lesson

67
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,430
about sexism?

68
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,780
Well...almost.

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,010
There was this tweet from your favorite,

70
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,300
the Global Times.

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,469
They thoughtfully used International Women's
Day

72
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,080
to remind everyone not to forget about men.

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,409
Then after the backlash,

74
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,200
they thoughtfully apologized by throwing a
male editor

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,550
under the proverbial bus.

76
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,550
That's interesting.

77
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,310
I did not know there was an International
Men's Day.

78
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,840
Gotta put that in my calendar.

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,579
Let's be real, Chris.

80
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,670
Every day is International Men's Day.

81
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,629
Hey, we can always use another

82
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,249
reason to celebrate.

83
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:58,249
Speaking of,

84
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:02,760
how did women in China celebrate women's day
this year?

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,519
Mostly by shopping.

86
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,030
Pretty much the exact opposite of the Day
Without a Woman

87
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,590
protests elsewhere in the world,

88
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,220
which asked women to not work,

89
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,269
and to refrain from buying things,

90
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,209
to show their economic impact.

91
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,609
So in capitalist Western countries,

92
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,200
women marched and went on strike,

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,180
while in communist China,

94
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,969
women went shopping.It's the "ever-changing
world in which we live in," Chris.

95
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,670
Retailers renamed women's day to Queen's Day

96
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,000
or Princess Day to attract customers.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Burger King even went the empowerment marketing route,

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,349
which was previously mostly done by

99
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,239
beauty products and tampons.

100
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,599
Empowerment marketing?

101
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,730
You know, when a brand digs into the

102
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,319
deep-seated insecurities of women,

103
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,129
but in a touching, relatable way.

104
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,640
Until they reveal to women

105
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,109
that they were the Burger Queen all along.

106
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,650
In fact, all women are \hBurger Queens.

107
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,069
That's...so beautiful.

108
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,919
Everyone is a Burger Queen.

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,820
Okay.

110
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,169
Oh, also Victoria's Secret celebrated

111
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,189
by opening a flagship store in Shanghai.

112
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,040
That's very important for our episode thumbnail.

113
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,510
You know, I support this massive push toward
consumerism

114
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,370
because when people shop,

115
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,870
capitalism wins.

116
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,360
But what does the Communist Party think?

117
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,870
Well, the Party supports this consumerism
as well.

118
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,850
It's because of what state-run press agency

119
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,140
Xinhua so hilariously calls the sheconomy.

120
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,480
Sheconomy, that's a good one.

121
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,630
Mmm.

122
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,730
The point is,

123
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,650
the Chinese government needs women to shop.

124
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,980
Women's spending is expected to

125
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,530
almost double in the few years,

126
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,080
which is hugely important as the Communist Party

127
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,010
tries to move China from an export-driven
economy

128
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,620
to a consumption-driven economy like the US.

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,980
Okay, I understand that.

130
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,700
But doesn't the Communist Party want to use

131
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,980
Women's Day to get back to their

132
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,700
men-and-women-are-equal, feminist roots?

133
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,180
Those roots are a lie, Chris.

134
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,650
I thought Mao wanted equal rights for women.

135
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,780
You know, the whole, “women hold up half
the sky” thing.

136
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,390
Mao didn't say that.

137
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,300
It was a mistranslation.

138
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,950
Like how Machiavelli said,

139
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,200
"The ends justify the means."

140
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,540
Except he didn’t.

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,830
What Machiavelli actually said was,

142
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,720
“One must consider the final result.”

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,380
That’s kinda different.

144
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,460
Right.

145
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,940
And what Mao actually said was that

146
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,670
women can hold up half the sky.

147
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,670
What?

148
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,740
That doesn't sound so "girl power" anymore.

149
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,300
It's true that the Communists abolished foot
binding,

150
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
and gave women the opportunity to get an education

151
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,190
and work outside the home.

152
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,600
But it wasn't because the Communists altruistically

153
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,280
believed in the equal rights and freedoms
of women.

154
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,660
Mao "liberated" women because he felt that
they were

155
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,960
an untapped source of labor.

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,220
When the Party took over China,

157
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,390
they needed to ramp up production fast,

158
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,510
and you can do that much easier

159
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,580
when half the population isn't forbidden from
working.

160
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,990
So what you're saying is that…

161
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,091
The Communist Party wanted women to be equal

162
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,390
with men so they could be equally exploited

163
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,780
and controlled by the Party-state.

164
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,960
And the labor force is just the beginning.

165
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,250
When Mao believed that China needed more workers,

166
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,290
he convinced women to have more babies.

167
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,450
When that backfired and the Party believed
they

168
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,710
were facing a demographic crisis,

169
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,980
they started the one-child policy.

170
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,970
Leading to forced abortions and sterilizations.

171
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,900
Yes, and Party officials monitoring your periods.

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
Wait, really?

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Yup.

174
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,900
All ways in which the Party

175
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,700
tries to control women's bodies.

176
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,990
And you know the thing they started 10 years
ago

177
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,830
about leftover women?

178
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, educated unmarried women

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,820
over the age of 27.

180
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,450
Well, now it's 25.

181
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,370
And there aren't leftover women in China.

182
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,720
There are about 30 million more men than women.

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
The whole thing is a propaganda campaign.

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,310
The Party is trying to manipulate women

185
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,370
into getting married younger so that

186
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,640
they can avoid the social instability that
comes from

187
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,550
having too many unmarried young men.

188
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,740
Wow, you're talking about a lot of issues here.

189
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Yeah, sorry,

190
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,270
it's just that Women's Day only comes once
a year

191
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,380
so I have to cram them all in.

192
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,280
What?

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,030
You can totally talk about women's issues

194
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,360
even when it's not Women's Day.

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,920
Well, thanks Chris.

196
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,540
That's very generous of you.

197
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
In fact,

198
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,620
in honor of International Women's Day,

199
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,680
I'd like to present the first annual

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,060
Most Outstanding Woman of China Uncensored
award

201
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,150
to you, Chris.

202
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,310
I get an award?!

203
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,580
Well, after all, by starting China Uncensored,

204
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,650
you gave me a platform

205
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,260
to talk about women's rights in China.

206
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm going to hang this up in my trophy room.

207
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,050
Right next to my China Uncensored

208
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,440
Host of the Month award.

209
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,800
And this gives me a great idea.

210
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm going to create a Most Outstanding Man

211
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,860
of China Uncensored award

212
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,250
for International Men's Day.

213
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,420
And do you know who I'm going to give it to?

214
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,280
Wow.

215
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,700
I have to say that's very open-

216
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Me!

217
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,940
What?

218
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,300
You're going to give yourself

219
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,760
the Most Outstanding Man award?

220
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,580
Yeah.

221
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,080
I mean,

222
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,740
you're out of the running

223
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
since you're a woman.

224
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,480
And like Matt is ever going to win

225
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,520
most outstanding man.

226
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,780
I'm the obvious choice.

227
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm speechless.

228
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,710
Don't worry, Shelley.

229
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,560
You'll always be a Burger Queen.

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
What?

231
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,790
I thought that was supposed to be empowering!

232
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,150
Well, what do you think about Women's Day

233
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,240
in China?

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Leave your comments below.

235
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,729
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

236
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,700
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.
