1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:03,739
Chinese troops mass on Hong Kong Border

2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:07,819
Google has a deeper relationship with Huawei
than we thought.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,480
And the secret of US foam.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,140
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,980
Foam.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,320
This is China Uncensored,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,180
This week’s China news headlines!

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,330
First up, Hong Kong.

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,010
I’ve got good news and bad news for Hong
Kong.

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,010
The good news—

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,730
the US government is keeping an eye on the
situation.

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,730
The bad news—

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,470
the situation is that Chinense troops may
be massing on the border.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,780
“What do we know about this alleged troop
build up on the border?”

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,670
“Well this is coming from a White House
official

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,600
who wanted to remain anonymous

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,190
telling journalists that they have evidence

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,340
that there is perhaps a congregation,

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,100
a buildup of Chinese troops, PLA,

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,960
or armed police at the border with Hong Kong.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,030
We don't know the numbers

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,520
and we don't know the nature of this build
up,

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,149
if in fact it is buildup.”

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,610
Yes, the nature of the thing,

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,290
if it indeed is a thing,

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,290
is a thing.

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,110
But I don’t want to make a thing out of
it.

30
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,970
Speaking of the People’s Liberation Army,

31
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,330
yesterday, August 1st, was their birthday!

32
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,750
The PLA is 92 years old.

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,430
Happy belated.

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And to celebrate,

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,570
the PLA has been releasing videos on social
media.

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,080
Including this one from the PLA’s Hong Kong
garrison.

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,840
Which seems to show soldiers blowing up innocent
cars,

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,369
yelling in Cantonese,

39
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,750
and running anti-riot drills against unarmed
civilians.

40
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,860
Lots of anti-riot drills.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,420
It’s almost like they’re trying to send
a message.

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,250
But Hong Kong protesters may not even need

43
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,610
to be worried about the Chinese military.

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,210
They just need to worry about cops.

45
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,350
This Hong Kong policeman started waving his
shotgun at protesters

46
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,280
with his finger on the trigger.

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,509
Police later said that the gun was loaded
with beanbag rounds,

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,060
and that the officer was in fear for his life.

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,870
Yeah, he looks terrified.

50
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,140
So Hong Kong police officers may not know
good trigger discipline.

51
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,609
But there is one thing they do know:

52
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:12,669
Triads.

53
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,950
Remember that triad attack on protesters a
week ago?

54
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,029
Hong Kong police knew about it ahead of time.

55
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,730
“The police have now admitted

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,459
they had intelligence days before the attack

57
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,409
that something was going down

58
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,599
but they chose not to act on the intelligence.”

59
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,840
Sounds to me like a secret plot by the Hong
Kong government.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,099
A secret plot,

61
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,300
where the protests gets more dangerous,

62
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,919
then they get more media attention,

63
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,599
and then the government is forced to give
in,

64
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,349
and give Hong Kongers their freedom back.

65
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,559
Or maybe the police are just incompetent.

66
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,349
A Texas man has been convicted

67
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,689
of stealing trade secrets for China.

68
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:52,379
According to federal prosecutors,

69
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,169
the 54-year-old man named Shan Shi,

70
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,540
“sent more than $3 million from China to
fund his efforts

71
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,909
to steal a Houston company’s process for
manufacturing a durable,

72
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,299
lightweight foam that’s essential for deep-sea
oil and gas drilling.”

73
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,609
China’s even trying to steal our foam secrets!

74
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:13,980
Wait, the US has foam secrets?

75
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,450
Google and the Chinese telecom company Huawei

76
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,469
may have had a deeper relationship than previously
thought.

77
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,830
According to the tech news website The Information,

78
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,019
Google and Huawei were involved in several
product development projects.

79
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,659
That came to an end when the Trump administration

80
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,730
essentially banned Huawei from the US market,

81
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,560
calling it a national security threat.

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,559
One of the projects was a Huawei branded smart
speaker

83
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,500
that used Google assistant.

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,979
It would have been called, AI Cube.

85
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,950
A nice friendly name that conjures up nice
friendly images.

86
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,439
Really a shame we won’t be seeing that in
our homes anytime soon.

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,419
Meanwhile, China is expected to roll out

88
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,989
a tough new expansion of a cybersecurity law.

89
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:56,129
It would in part,

90
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:58,129
“forbid certain data from leaving China

91
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,339
or at least slow the process of dispatching
data,

92
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,540
which would increase uncertainties and costs
for business.”

93
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,430
Cybersecurity laws in China have allowed the
Chinese regime

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,150
to maintain a tighter grip on data and information
within China,

95
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,989
eliminate data privacy,

96
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,669
and serve as a legal means for the Party

97
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,049
to steal Western intellectual property.

98
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,150
The sad part about all this is the new rules

99
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,570
are going to hurt companies like Cisco and
Dell,

100
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,500
the very same companies that helped build

101
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,040
China’s vast network of surveillance systems
and control.

102
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,180
My heart bleeds for them.

103
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,490
Facebook has been desperate to get into China,

104
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,050
ever since it was banned there.

105
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,289
But now they may have a powerful bargaining
chip—

106
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,810
digital currency.

107
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,300
Facebook announced it plans

108
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,070
to create its own cryptocurrency called Libra.

109
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,370
“Introducing Libra, a digital currency

110
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,860
designed for the digital world.”

111
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,310
And here I thought the Borg Cube was scary.

112
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,419
The issue for China is they’ve been trying

113
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,800
to make their own cryptocurrency

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
since about 2014.

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Why?

116
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,350
According to NPR,

117
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,639
“A digital currency would allow China's
central bank

118
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,240
to record every single transaction with high
precision in real time.”

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,639
That would be a powerful tool for control
in a society

120
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,860
where almost everything is paid for digitally.

121
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,139
And according to a Chinese crypto expert,

122
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,979
“China relies on the mobile payments sector
immensely.

123
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,960
We have had a long lead time [over Libra]

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,389
with the success of WeChat and Alipay,

125
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,919
but Libra represents a huge threat on mobile
payments.”

126
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,530
Facebook says Libra will be ready by 2020.

127
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,960
And since Facebook has 2.4 billion users,

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,870
more than double the users China’s WeChat
has,

129
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,161
it could seriously rival China’s global
cryptocurrency ambitions.

130
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:41,949
And that’s exactly how Facebook is framing
Libra.

131
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,969
At least to the US government.

132
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,700
In this statement to the House Financial Services
Committee,

133
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,189
David Marcus, the man behind Libra said,

134
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,219
“I believe that if America does not lead
innovation

135
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,409
in the digital currency and payments area,

136
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,820
others will.”

137
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,840
But considering Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,310
was so desperate to get Facebook in China,

139
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,120
that he ask Chinese presitator Xi Jinping

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,610
to name his first born daughter...

141
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,870
...who knows how he’ll leverage Libra

142
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,220
to get access to that sweet,

143
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,040
sweet China market?

144
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,599
Now on to Human Rights.

145
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,009
In a violation of all of our human rights,

146
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,449
Reuters has started making puns.

147
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,490
In a sign of the times,

148
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,020
China is banning Arabic an Muslim symbols
on signs.

149
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,620
Of course the real victims here aren’t groaning
readers.

150
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,360
It’s Chinese Muslims.

151
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,710
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a
massive campaign

152
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,729
to “sinicize” the religion.

153
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,030
Sinicizing mainly involves rounding up Muslims

154
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,999
and putting them in brainwashing camps

155
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,139
to rid them of their culture

156
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,490
and make them love the Communist Party.

157
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,639
And while there was evidence that more than
a million people

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,099
were in those concentration camps,

159
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,790
concentrating on how much they love the Communist
Party that is,

160
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,699
most of them have been released!

161
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,699
According to China.

162
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,360
Yet “A spokeswoman for the US state department
said

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,689
there was no evidence to support the assertion.”

164
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,470
China is banning individual travel permits
to Taiwan.

165
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,639
That could cost the Taiwanese economy up to
900 million US dollars.

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,380
The Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan
a breakaway province

167
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,949
that they’re retake by force if necessary.

168
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,210
But since the US just made

169
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,710
a 2 billion dollar weapons deal with Taiwan...

170
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,949
taking the island by force seems less of a
sure thing.

171
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:17,949
Good thing they’re also trying to

172
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,150
take over the island with economic force—

173
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,300
variably punishing or rewarding Taiwan with
tourism,

174
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,729
depending on Taiwan’s stance.

175
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,490
Despite the banning of individual travel permits
from mainland China,

176
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,060
the Taiwan government said it “would spend
an additional

177
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,940
NT$3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of the
year on promoting tourism.”

178
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,000
And may I just say to the Taiwan board of
tourism

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,449
that if you really want to reach Americans,

180
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,969
consider spending your tourism dollars here
at China Uncensored!

181
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,560
We accept cash, Bitcoin, and Libra.

182
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,029
Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi

183
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,660
is saying there’s major progress

184
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,090
on South China Sea Code of Conduct talks.

185
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,999
This is the South China sea.

186
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,650
China claims this giant part of it.

187
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,510
Which upsets all these countries.

188
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,430
China and those ASEAN countries are holding
talks

189
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,479
on how to resolve territorial disputes.

190
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,949
I assume using more words than just,

191
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:11,300
“Gimme gimme gimme!”

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,999
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

193
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,979
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

194
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,139
a fan who support China Uncensored with a
dollar or more per episode,

195
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,889
by contributing through Patreon.

196
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,979
Anniina Kafka asks,

197
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,729
“This interview with Thae Yong-ho got me
thinking:

198
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,090
have you heard about the Flash Drives for
Freedom initiative

199
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,360
and what do you think of it?”

200
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,680
Thae Yong-ho was the former North Korean diplomat
who defected.

201
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,440
We published an interview with him earlier
this week.

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,510
Great question, Anniina!

203
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,979
Yes, I learned about the Flash Drives for
Freedom project

204
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,529
at the Oslo Freedom Forum,

205
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,000
where we interviewed Thae Yong-ho.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,970
It is fairly memorable.

207
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,990
Apparently USBs are a major way

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,510
people share information in North Korea.

209
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,250
So defectors have been smuggling in USB drives

210
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,010
with information to counter propaganda from
the Korean state.

211
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,720
It’s a lot more effective than that time
I tried to smuggle

212
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,930
a China Uncensored USB drive to China via
balloon.

213
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,360
If you’re interested in helping out,

214
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,180
you can visit flash drives for freedom dot
org

215
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,580
and donate your old USBs or donate money.

216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,190
Every dollar lets them send one USB drive.

217
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,750
Thanks for your question.

218
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
And thanks to everyone watching!

219
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,449
We could not make this show without your support.

220
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,320
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

221
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,360
or just watching and sharing the show with
your friends and family.

222
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
So thank you from me

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,180
and everyone on the China Uncensored team.

224
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,400
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

225
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,160
see you next time.
