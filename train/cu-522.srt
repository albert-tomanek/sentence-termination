00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,909
there’s gold in them thar...

3
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:05,520
Olympic Games...

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,429
It’s that time again

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,550
when countries around the world set aside
their differences

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,730
and come together...

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,580
to decide which country is the greatest through
gladiatorial combat.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,600
Otherwise known as the Olympics.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,640
Sadly they’ve done away with the nudity
and death matches

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,350
that made the ancient world so great.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,190
But China wants you to know that it is the
greatest country on Earth.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,859
China always gets pretty excited for the Olympic
Games.

14
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,070
China brought home only 5 gold medals at the
1988 Olympics.

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,679
But like that scrawny kid in high school,

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,309
they've been drinking milk.

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,839
And at the 30 year reunion,

18
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,690
they came back a beefcake,

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,850
winning 51 gold medals in 2008.

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,109
So understandably, Chinese people want some
respect.

21
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,359
Should the rest of the world hold China's
banner high?

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,280
Well they did.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,030
And it looked like this.

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,750
Yeah, that's the Chinese flag.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,299
But not quite.

26
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,430
Chinese media was furious about such an obvious
blunder

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,500
at medal ceremonies during the early days
of the Rio Olympics.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Subtle error?!

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,890
I don’t think so.

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,740
This is the actual Chinese flag.

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,079
And this is the flag hoisted at the Olympics.

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,180
See?

33
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,250
The stars are angled wrong!

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,850
I mean, what idiots approved this?!

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,799
Oh the Chinese Olympic Committee did.

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,419
Well, obviously they would have assumed Rio
could get the right Chinese flag.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,260
I mean, where did they get that that knock
off anyway?!

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,570
Kind of ironic that the knockoff Chinese flag
was made in China.

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,079
But that was only the beginning of the humiliation
China had to endure.

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,909
Last Saturday, Australian swimmer Mack Horton

41
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,130
apparently called Chinese swim champ Sun Yang
a drug cheat.

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,340
Sun did test positive for a banned drug back
in 2014,

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,049
one that he said he was taking for a heart
condition.

44
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,220
But that drug is now no longer considered
a stimulant,

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,970
and is no longer banned.

46
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,120
So that was unfair.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,540
If Sun deserves to be called out for anything,

48
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,140
it's apparently for acting like kind of an
arrogant jerk.

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,849
Swimmers: the Axe Body Spray of the Olympics.

50
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,480
Anyway, state-run media Global Times

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,069
did not like Horton's comments about Sun.

52
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:36,030
In fact, they took it as an opportunity to
slam the entire country of Australia.

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,849
Not only did the Global Times call Horton’s
win “immoral” and “disgraceful,”

54
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,740
it called Australian media “evil” and
suggested that Australia,

55
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,890
“a country at the fringes of civilization,”
and “Britain's offshore prison,”

56
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,209
might have, “a different moral standard.”

57
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,600
And if you think Global Times

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,090
is making a really, really big deal out of
something

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,939
that maybe isn’t that big of a deal,

60
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,559
“It's not a big deal to us.”

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
Right.

62
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,189
So why is China so obsessed with Olympic prestige?

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,730
For more on this

64
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,740
I’m joined by Senior Expert on the Feelings
of the Chinese People, Mia Chen.

65
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,420
Mia, ni hao?

66
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,099
Uhh, g’day Chris.

67
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,909
I like your headdress.

68
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,090
Is that one of those ancient Ming Dynasty
ones?

69
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,610
No, it's just to keep the flies away.

70
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,430
Wait, are you speaking with...

71
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,950
An Australian accent?

72
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,890
I was going to say an offshore British prison
accent, but yes.

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,660
Righteo

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,030
So why is Chinese media reacting so strongly
to,

75
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,560
what some might call, petty things?

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
Well, the Chinese media is a bit aggro, Chris.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,780
But Olympic gold is one of the few things
China can say

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,549
it’s neck and neck at with the United States.

79
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,349
They've got heaps of medals, now.

80
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,470
That’s the kind of soft power you can only
get

81
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,340
by taking kids as young as five out of school

82
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,450
and training them all day every day in the
hopes

83
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,540
that one of them can be the best...

84
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,219
at trampoline.

85
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,209
“Only two men will be chosen to represent
China at trampoline in Rio...

86
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,310
I was selected for training when I was 7.

87
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,060
Or you can x-ray them to see if they're going
to grow really tall,

88
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,560
like they did to Sun Yang.

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,459
What?

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,609
Are you a criminal?

91
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,720
Oh, don’t you start that too!

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,430
Australia is very diverse, and only a few
parts of it were used as a prison colony,

93
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,680
and that was a really long time ago…

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,610
Oh, I’m sorry,

95
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,090
I think Mia had to go put some shrimp on the
barbie.

96
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,810
So what do you think of China’s Olympic
reaction?

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,780
Leave your comments below.

98
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,020
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you next time.

99
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,370
Um, you know we call them “prawns”.

100
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,690
And we don’t barbecue them.

101
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,949
So you've just met my friend Mia Chen from
Asian Beauty Secrets.

102
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:54,949
Hi!

103
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,580

food, and ancient wisdom,

105
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,130
Seriously, it's pretty awesome.

Go check it out.

107
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,270
And where can I get one of those cool fly-swatter
hats?

108
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,699
Actually, those are only for tourists.

109
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,699
Like Foster's beer.

110
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,199
What?
