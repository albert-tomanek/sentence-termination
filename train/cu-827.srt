00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,460
does China fear a revolting army?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,460
I mean,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,380
I don’t think they’re all that revolting...

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,940
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,309
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,080
Protesters sure are a pain.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,110
Unless you’re the Chinese Communist Party.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,870
Then protesters are easily dealt with.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,800
Except of course when the protesters are military
veterans.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
Chanting unity is strength,

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,810
they had demanded better government support

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,420
for military retirees.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,140
There have been other protests by army veterans,

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,710
but it’s believed this was the biggest,

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,230
lasting 12 hours.

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,230
Yes,

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,649
over 1,000 People’s Liberation Army veterans

19
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:50,250
lined up outside the Chinese Ministry of National
Defense in Beijing—

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,100
and were quickly surrounded by police and
busses

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,930
so no one had to see.

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,670
And believe me folks,

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,050
when protesting in the capital

24
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,160
of one of the most repressive regimes on Earth,

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,110
nothing beats a Pepsi!

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,430
Eventually they were all bussed away.

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,840
And any mention of the protest on Chinese
social media

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,890
was censored.

29
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,120
According to an activist interviewed by AP,

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,880
“veterans have staged more than 50 protests

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,600
this year alone.”

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,740
And this is a problem for the Chinese Communist
Party.

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,610
Because it’s in some ways harder to crack
down on veterans

34
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,110
than other groups.

35
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,110
Yes,

36
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,560
veterans can be better organized

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,810
and they come equipped with a nationwide network

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,689
of comrades-in-arms.

39
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,970
But there’s also the political risk.

40
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,740
The Communist Party may have been able to
convince the nation

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,780
that Falun Gong,

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,030
a peaceful meditation practice with zero political
aspirations,

43
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,520
was a dangerous group out to destroy China.

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,720
It’s a little trickier to do that with your
own troops

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,960
We need to crack down on veterans because...

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,729
they served our country!

47
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:57,570
So why are veterans protesting so much in
China?

48
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,570
I mean,

49
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,650
don’t soldiers in China have to swear an
oath

50
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,140
to “follow the leadership of the Communist
Party of China?”

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,840
Well, here’s one reason.

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Last September,

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,679
the Chinese Communist Party held a huge military
parade,

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,030
to celebrate how they defeated the Japanese
in World War II.

55
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,030
They did not.

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,090
That was a lie.

57
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,450
But during the parade,

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,950
soldiers got to line up in rank and file,

59
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,030
new shiny missiles were shown off,

60
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,349
and tanks rolled down the streets of Beijing,

61
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,730
and no students got crushed!

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,440
But troops may have realized something was
amiss

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,540
when Chinese Leader Xi Jinping gave his speech

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,000
at the war parade,

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,879
and mentioned “peace” 17 times.

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,830
Because what he was trying to tell the troops
was…

67
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,330
“You’re fired.”

68
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,840
I mean,

69
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,500
why do you need so many troops when China
will

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,180
“advance the noble cause of global peace
and development,”

71
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,660
“We Chinese love peace,”

72
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
and

73
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,770
“In the interest of peace,

74
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,750
China will remain committed to peaceful development?”

75
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,390
And that was all in like two paragraphs.

76
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,580
Xi Jinping wasn’t out to give peace of mind.

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,970
He was out to give a piece of his mind—

78
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,590
with massive layoffs.

79
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,950
At the parade,

80
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,070
Xi announced 300,000 military layoffs,

81
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,900
an entire 13% of troops,

82
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,250
to be completed by the end of 2017.

83
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,910
Those are the biggest layoffs to hit the Chinese
military

84
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,670
since 1997,

85
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,370
when half a million soldiers were fired.

86
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,490
Or as the Party calls it,

87
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,650
“demobilized.”

88
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,220
But the real reason for the layoffs

89
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,980
is not that the Communist Party is peace-loving,

90
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,050
but rather, China’s military has grown up.

91
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,269
Literally, actually,

92
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,379
soldiers can’t fit into the old tanks.

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,379
But you see,

94
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,690
in the good old days,

95
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,690
you could fight a war

96
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,489
by just throwing wave after wave of your own
men

97
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,489
at the enemy.

98
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,340
Mao even famously said,

99
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,190
“China has a population of 600 million;

100
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,019
even if half of them are killed,

101
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,159
there are still 300 million people left.”

102
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,409
And now that the population has doubled...

103
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,040
It’s the Zap Brannigan strategy

104
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,519
Hit the like button if you get it.

105
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,069
But current Chinese leader Xi Jinping

106
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,190
wants to modernize the military

107
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,470
by spending less on people,

108
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,669
and more on high tech weaponry,

109
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:19,220
particularly for the air force and navy.

110
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,110
Plus now they want people who have college
educations.

111
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,129
And that’s bad news for the older Chinese
soldiers,

112
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:29,550
many of whom only went to middle school or
high school.

113
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,120
That makes them more likely to be "demobilized"
into retirement.

114
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,849
There are about 6 million People’s Liberation
Army veterans on welfare.

115
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,169
But China is one of the few major countries
that has

116
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,490
no centralized government department or civic
group

117
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,800
handling veterans affairs.

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,159
So it falls to cash-strapped local governments
to give veterans pensions,

119
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,419
healthcare, guaranteed jobs--

120
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,210
all the things the Party promised them.

121
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,119
Could this possibly lead to abuse and corruption?

122
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:03,289
“We’ve gotten nothing since retiring from
service:

123
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,409
no pensions, no social security.”

124
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,719
That’s according to one of the protesters

125
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,559
interviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

126
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,559
Apparently,

127
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,199
it’s also common for local officials to
pocket

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,620
a portion of veterans’ stipends,

129
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,860
which ranks somewhere in between taking candy
from a baby

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,249
and stealing old ladies’ purses.

131
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,339
Thirty years ago,

132
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,770
Chinese veterans would just be given jobs
in state-run enterprises.

133
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,490
But a lot of those have shut down.

134
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,999
And now with a slowing economy...

135
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,349
and a tightening job market...

136
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,350
...things aren’t looking good for China’s
veterans.

137
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,690
As one of last week’s protesters told AP,

138
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,939
some veterans living in the countryside are
provided

139
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,960
with as little as $60 a month.

140
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Which,

141
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,559
if you’ve seen my recent episode,

142
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:52,379
you know that’s barely enough to live above
the abject poverty line

143
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,330
of a dollar ninety per day.

144
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,379
And although last week's protest got a lot
of attention,

145
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,199
this isn't a new issue.

146
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,199
In fact,

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,599
the Chinese military has been analyzing veterans
protests

148
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,179
since at least 1991.

149
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:08,179
And according to NPR,

150
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,750
in 2010,

151
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,779
Party officials listed "dissatisfied veterans"

152
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,180
as one of the three emerging threats to political
stability.

153
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,999
That might be why state-run media have been
emphasizing

154
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,520
over the last few months

155
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,439
that the Party will definitely find jobs for
demobilized soldiers.

156
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,069
So how has the regime responded

157
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,029
to these latest protests from veterans?

158
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,439
By warning of “hostile forces” trying
to take advantage of the situation.

159
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,009
I can’t take all the credit, of course.

160
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,009
Because really,

161
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,310
if there’s any hostile force out to get
veterans,

162
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,020
it would have to be the Chinese Communist
Party.

163
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,309
Because “Veterans say those who protest,

164
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,080
petition and sue the government are often
detained

165
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,249
or kept under surveillance.”

166
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,300
And according to Radio Free Asia,

167
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,029
that's just what happened to some of the protesters

168
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,500
who went to Beijing last week.

169
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,629
They were brought back to their home provinces,

170
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,050
then questioned in temporary detention centers

171
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,020
about who organized the protests.

172
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,020
But hey,

173
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,069
the Chinese regime is working hard.

174
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,629
And not just by arresting veterans

175
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,869
and blaming hostile forces.

176
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:18,619
They also sent an infuriatingly dismissive
letter to Reuters

177
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:21,590
saying they really do care about veterans.

178
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,330
The Defense Ministry wrote that the Party

179
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,990
“cares about veterans

180
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,830
and pays high attention to resolving their
problems,"

181
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
and,

182
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,490
“the temporary living difficulties of some
veterans

183
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,960
will be resolved."

184
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,119
But considering how they handle most dissidents
in China,

185
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,099
let’s just hope they don’t find a permanent
solution

186
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,629
to those temporary living difficulties.

187
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,589
So what do you think of how the Chinese Communist
Party

188
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:46,709
treats its veterans?

189
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,800

Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

see you next time.
