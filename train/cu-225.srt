1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,899
The US finally moves to extradite Huawei CFO
Meng Wanzhou.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,240
China decides its courts are too independent.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,700
And kidnapping?

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,080
The Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t dream
of it.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,320
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,440
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,640
so you get an alert when we publish a new
episode.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,400
We all knew it was coming,

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,060
and it’s finally happened.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,840
“The U.S. has told Canada to expect a formal
request

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,410
to extradite Meng Wanzhou the detained CFO
of Huawei.”

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,650
But that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen
right away—

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,160
or even at all.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,730
Because if there’s one thing the US government
loves,

18
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,880
it’s endless paperwork.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,090
Back in December,

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,690
Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou,

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,290
the CFO of China’s largest telecom company,
Huawei.

22
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,140
It was at the request of the US.

23
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,970
Huawei has been accused of using a shell company

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,710
to violate US sanctions on Iran and possibly
Syria.

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,960
Needless to say, after weeks calling for Meng’s
release,

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,979
the Chinese Communist Party was not too happy

27
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,280
with the idea of extradition to the US.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,450
On Tuesday, Beijing shot back,

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,030
saying Canada should release Meng immediately

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,700
and accusing the two countries

31
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,600
of abusing their extradition treaty.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,730
“Canada and the United States arbitrarily

33
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,840
abused their bilateral extradition treaty

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,590
to seriously infringe upon a Chinese citizen’s

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,909
security and legal rights.

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,189
We urge the Canadian side

37
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,780
to immediately release Ms. Meng Wanzhou

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,479
and earnestly safeguard her legitimate

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,760
and lawful rights and interests.”

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,999
Yeah!

41
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,829
She’s entitled to legitimate and lawful
rights!

42
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,229
In Canada, obviously, not in China.

43
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,549
No one has rights in China—

44
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,460
especially not Canadians.

45
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,299
That’s why the Chinese regime had no qualms

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,799
about detaining two Canadians,

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,460
and accusing them of spying...

48
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,869
based off what I’m sure is very solid evidence.

49
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,030
Their real mistake, of course,

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,219
was setting foot in mainland China in the
first place.

51
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,250
On Monday,

52
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,789
143 Western academics and diplomats

53
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,000
sent this open letter to Chinese leader Xi
Jinping

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,750
urging him to release the Canadians.

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,450
And now I can name 143 more people

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,940
who should probably not set foot in mainland
China.

57
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,850
Speaking of ensuring legitimate and lawful
rights...

58
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,140
China’s Supreme People’s Court.

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,170
They’ve ruled that the whole Western model
of judicial independence,

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,470
is bad.

61
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,810
They said China’s courts should

62
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,220
“Resolutely resist the influence of the
West’s

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,630
erroneous thought and mistaken viewpoints.”

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,840
Mistaken viewpoints like,

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,510
don’t detain innocent people for political
reasons.

66
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,690
The Chinese Communist Party controls the courts,

67
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,010
but that’s not enough!

68
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,020
It’s also looking for more ways to exert
direct control over religions.

69
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,900
And what better way than rewriting the Bible

70
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,430
to be more in line with “correct thinking”
from the Party?

71
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,790
I talked about this in a recent episode.

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,790
And as a joke,

73
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,340
I read completely made-up quotes

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,670
from this completely made-up book.

75
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,920
At least, that’s what I thought at the time.

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,990
But now I’ve learned—

77
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,390
and this is true—

78
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,600
that local officials in Henan Province

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,780
“ordered [a Henan] church to wipe out the
first Commandment,

80
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,870
‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me.’”

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,220
I guess they didn’t get the hint when they
told people

82
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,270
to replace pictures of Jesus with pictures
of Xi Jinping.

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,420
Speaking of brainwashing,

84
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,170
more brainwashing!

85
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,360
Since the time of former Chinese leader Hu
Jintao—

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
you know, the one that we all forgot about—

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,740
Chinese students have been forced to take

88
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,710
“Current Affairs and Policies” classes.

89
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,300
Well, China’s Ministry of Education

90
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,710
has been pushing these classes even more recently.

91
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,360
The goal is to “help college students understand

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,910
the situation at home and abroad

93
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,380
in the new era correctly.”

94
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,080
Peking University,

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,320
the Harvard of China,

96
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,650
has taken the lead.

97
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,570
They’ve opened an entire institute dedicated

98
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,100
to what’s officially called “Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism

99
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,860
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

100
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,970
I get it.

101
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,420
You need an entire institute

102
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,040
to figure out what any of those words mean.

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,140
Fortunately, one Chinese student has dissected
it.

104
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,780
“[He] told Radio Free Asia that the course

105
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,340
is actually ‘brainwashing’ education

106
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,759
in combination with current events.

107
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,780
He cited the US-China trade war as an example.

108
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,159
‘The course tells how the United States

109
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:30,610
is rude and unreasonable toward China.

110
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,949
It also preaches that the party is very great
a

111
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,220
nd instills ideas about the party-state system

112
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,860
and about xenophobia.’”

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,289
Well obviously the Party is very great.

114
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,699
Only the very great need to forcibly remind
you that they’re very great.

115
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,569
And the Party is obviously very great—

116
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,190
at disappearing people.

117
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,580
For instance, Chinese-Australian Writer Yang
Hengjun,

118
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,009
who mysteriously vanished after getting off
a plane in China last week.

119
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,370
Days later, Chinese authorities finally admitted
they had detained Yang,

120
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,319
who is a blogger, novelist, and former Chinese
diplomat.

121
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,560
They said it was because Yang was “endangering
national security.”

122
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,180
It seems like Yang has become part of

123
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,460
the Chinese regime’s hottest new trend:

124
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,300
hostage diplomacy.

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,800
Of course, the Communist Party kidnapping

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,229
citizens of other countries is not something
new.

127
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,349
It’s just been more noticeable lately.

128
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,490
So noticeable, that people tried to convince
Yang

129
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,820
not to go back to China.

130
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,319
But he told his friend Dr. Feng Chongyi

131
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,319
that he would be ok,

132
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,940
because he had toned down his criticism of
the Party.

133
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,060
Unfortunately for Yang,

134
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,279
the Chinese Communist Party can really hold
a grudge.

135
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,159
Maybe Yang should have listened to Dr. Feng,

136
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,430
especially since Feng was detained in China
back in 2017.

137
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,409
Make that 144 people who should not set foot
in mainland China.

138
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,229
The Chinese-controlled city of Macau.

139
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,639
It’s number one in the world when it comes
to gambling...

140
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,690
And definitely when it comes to ugly architecture.

141
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,699
So it makes sense that Macau’s crime syndicates

142
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,360
would also be number one.

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,259
Well, police say they’ve uncovered a 4.4
billion dollar

144
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,560
money laundering scheme.

145
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,580
So that’s the ancient Chinese secret.

146
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,809
Money laundering is a big problem

147
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,300
for the Chinese Communist Party.

148
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,099
China’s elite, including Party members,

149
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,580
are concerned that China’s economy isn’t
doing so hot.

150
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,259
They want to get their money out.

151
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,479
And while there are a bunch of laws in place
to stop them,

152
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,499
rich people always find a way.

153
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:30,569
And that way is Macau.

154
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,409
Or it was, until authorities found that a
crime syndicate

155
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,189
was smuggling in machines “to allow gamblers

156
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,749
to secretly cash out their casino winnings

157
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,279
in Hong Kong dollars and Macanese patacas.”

158
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
This could be the beginning of

159
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,909
a more serious investigation into Macau’s
money laundering,

160
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:50,159
and why anyone would want Macanese patacas.

161
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,229
And across the bay from Macau is Hong Kong—

162
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,999
the other special administrative region of
China.

163
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,029
Hong Kong, of course,

164
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,719
has its own government and laws,

165
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,759
separate from the rest of China.

166
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,249
Now I know, you’re worried that this is
a problem—

167
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,380
because sometimes Hong Kongers’ thinking
is too independent,

168
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,470
and not in line with the correct thinking
for a new era.

169
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,589
But don’t worry.

170
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,939
They’re starting to rectify that.

171
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,039
The Hong Kong legislature is moving to make

172
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,849
disrespecting the Chinese national anthem
a crime.

173
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:19,849
For far too long,

174
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,789
Hong Kongers have been openly negative

175
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,749
about the Chinese Communist Party.

176
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:26,779
For example by booing the Chinese national
anthem

177
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:34,139
at sports matches.

178
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,729
The new bill proposes 3 years in jail

179
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,830
for dissing China’s national anthem,

180
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,510
as well as a fine of over six thousand US
dollars.

181
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,849
Or 51 thousand Macanese patacas,

182
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,250
if you’re trying to get rid of those.

183
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,469
And yes, the proposed law “also extends
to schoolchildren,

184
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,939
including pupils of international schools,

185
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,279
who would be legally required to learn the
anthem.”

186
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,279
Something fun to look forward to

187
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,879
if you’re planning on studying in Hong Kong.

188
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,529
And before we go, now is the time

189
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,199
when I answer questions from you,

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,400
my loyal 50-cent army—

191
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,159
fans of the show who support what we do

192
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,159
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

193
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,830
James Wallberg asks

194
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,599
“I know a lot of people are upset with Patreon
and Paypal.

195
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,819
Are you planning on finding other methods
of payment

196
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,369
for those who want to support China Uncensored

197
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,460
but no longer wish to use their services?”

198
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
Great question!

199
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I know many of you

200
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,050
are concerned about using Patreon as a platform

201
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,849
after they kicked off several prominent YouTubers.

202
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,060
I of course don’t approve of that kind of
behavior.

203
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,479
So I can definitely appreciate where you’re
coming from.

204
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,800
However, the problem is China Uncensored

205
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,469
is already being squeezed by YouTube.

206
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,399
And Patreon is still the best way for us

207
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,910
to raise funds for the show.

208
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,670
I started to look into Patreon alternatives,

209
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,320
like SubscribeStar,

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
but guess what?

211
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,550
It doesn’t always go well for alternatives.

212
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,070
And even though SubscribeStar is starting
to resume payments,

213
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,550
it’s too big a risk for us.

214
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,120
We are working on creating our own alternative,

215
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,720
but to do that, we still need funding.

216
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,670
And right now, Patreon is the best option
for us.

217
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,070
You can visit our website to make a direct
PayPal contribution,

218
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,959
but we don’t have a good way of making sure
you get rewards—

219
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,690
like me answering your questions on the show
like this.

220
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,000
So we prefer Patreon.

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,370
I know many of you have expressed you’re
not a fan of Patreon,

222
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,410
but for now, I’d ask you to hold out just
a bit longer

223
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,540
for the sake of China Uncensored.

224
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
If you ditch Patreon,

225
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,589
it doesn’t hurt Patreon much,

226
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,940
but it hurts China Uncensored a lot.

227
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,420
Thanks for you question and thanks for your
support.

228
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,660
And to all you thanks for watching.

229
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,339
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

230
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,320
See you next time.
