00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,550
I sat down with the most beautiful woman in
Canada—

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,890
and so can you.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,100
If you sit down while watching this.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,999
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,840
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,740
Brave.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,760
Heroic.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,119
A peerless beauty.

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,779
These are just a few of the things people
have said

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,219
about me.

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,040
Which is why I was so happy to speak with
Anastasia Lin,

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,030
someone I consider even braver and heroicker.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,180
Not an equally peerless beauty of course,

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,510
since the whole point of being peerless

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,510
is you don’t have peers.

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,700
You might know Anastasia Lin as the 2015 Miss
World Canada.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,790
She caused an international uproar

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,280
when she actually tried to uphold Miss World’s
mission statement:

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,610
“Beauty with a Purpose.”

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,000
“She’s spoken out about religious persecution
in China

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,740
and acted in films that highlight human rights
issues.”

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,900
C’mon Anastasia!

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,840
“Beauty with a Purpose” is supposed be
a thing you say,

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,820
not a thing you do!

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,680
But, no, she actually did stuff.

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,460
Like testify before US Congress on religious
persecution in China.

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,979
So when the finals for last year’s Miss
World were held in China,

29
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:23,479
obviously Anastasia had to “accept consequences
of [her] political action.”

30
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:27,030
In other words, the Chinese regime denied
her a visa,

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,869
making it impossible for her to compete in
the finals.

32
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,149
Also, they threatened her father, who lives
in China.

33
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,449
Also, they launched a state-run media blitz
to smear her name.

34
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,609
Did it work?

35
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:42,350
Did it silence this beauty with a purpose?

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,280
I took time out of my busy hero schedule last
week to talk with her and find out.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,030
These are the sacrifices I make for you, my
audience—

38
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,590
talking to beauty queens.

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,520
So, Anastasia, I really admire you

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,810
because my favorite Chinese state-run media
The Global Times

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,210
has written several articles about you.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,980
They have not written anything about me yet.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Well, I feel quite honored that they did that.

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,700
It is the highest honor, isn't it?

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,340
Well anyway, they’ve written about you that
you will

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,290
“pay a cost for being tangled with hostile
forces against China.”

47
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,990
Have you paid that cost?

48
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,050
I think what they meant is that I wouldn’t
get into the mainland market.

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,340
Who knows? Maybe I'm already on the underground
market.

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,750
They just don't know about it.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,500
So tell us about some of the things you’ve
been doing

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,140
since this whole Miss World thing went down.

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,880
Well, on the Miss World final day,

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,430
I went to the National Press Club in Washington,
DC.

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,080
They invited me for a luncheon.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,870
That’s sort of a response to the Miss World
Final in China.

57
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,630
They’re kind of a big deal right?

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Yeah. There were a lot of cameras there.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,870
I felt quite honored to have the platform

60
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,590
to talk to the world.

61
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,360
And then there’s the Oxford Union debates.

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,880
So you really are syncing up with hostile
foreign forces against China.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,720
The first thing you do is you go to Washington,
DC.

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
Why not go to

65
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,110
North Korea

66
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,970
an ally of China?

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,710
North Korea?

68
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,890
I think they’d probably detain me if I go
there.

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,090
Well you are a beauty queen.

70
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,410
I mean, who wouldn’t want to detain you?

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,340
Oh my goodness.

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,000
I wasn’t ready for that joke.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But ok, Washington, DC of course…

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,580
You mean CNN doesn’t do things like that?

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,220
No, not really. They’re…

76
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,080
Professional?

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,600
Um, what was I saying again?

78
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,820
Yes, Washington, DC.

79
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,870
Washington, DC is the capital of the United
States,

80
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,350
the core of the free world.

81
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,680
So I feel, to be able to speak there…

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,020
Actually, on the day I was presenting there,

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,520
Barrack was hosting a press conference.

84
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,800
You are on a first-name basis with

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,750
the president of the United States?

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,260
Well, we’re competitors

87
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,850
because he was hosting a press conference

88
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,410
across the street from me.

89
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,410
It’s kind of hard to compete for attention
with

90
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,670
the president of the US, but

91
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,680
I think I held up well.

92
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,229
And then I went to testify in the UK Parliament,

93
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:19,709
and I went to meet the Dalai Lama last week.

94
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,769
The Dalai Lama?

95
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,360
So clearly, you have been totally shunned
by

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
the rest of the world for speaking out against
China.

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,419
At times. When my dress sponsor pulled out
from sponsoring me

98
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,969
because he had family members who are still
in China,

99
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:41,699
I did feel a little bit like the carpet under
me was pulled away, but

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,300
I did receive tremendous support from
all over the world.

101
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,720
Well about that, I know you have family in
China.

102
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,930
I’m wondering how they’re doing?

103
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,680
But also, like, the difference between…

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,940
Your family was threatened,

105
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,800
but you still did what you thought was right.

106
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,490
How do you feel about your dress sponsor,
as an example,

107
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,410
having their family be used against them in
that way?

108
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,050
I feel quite terrible for that guy,

109
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,710
because it must be very scary to suddenly
get

110
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,379
an email from the Chinese Consulate.

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,499
No one wants to put their family at risk.

112
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,980
I’m the same.

113
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,600
But at the beginning I felt that if I don’t

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,239
use the chance to speak up,

115
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:30,139
I may not ever get the chance again.

116
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,859
And if they know that this will work on me,

117
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,260
then they might keep doing things like that
to me,

118
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,030
to my family.

119
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,260
It’s just, I felt like that was the only
solution:

120
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,440
speaking up.

121
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,319
It seems like speaking up really did cause
quite

122
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,919
an uproar in the world.

123
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,820
Since that, has everything been ok with your
father in China?

124
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,840
Or has there been more pressure?

125
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
I know that his business partner backed out
from a deal,

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,449
and that’s probably just one partner that
he’s told me about.

127
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,389
In China, since the state media was not very
friendly with me…

128
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,740
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,280
The Global Times wrote several articles all
about you.

130
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,260
Yeah, um

131
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,350
questioning why I was “entangled with anti-China
forces.”

132
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,140
Yeah, my father did receive tremendous pressure,

133
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,270
and nowadays he doesn’t even tell me about
it,

134
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,719
because he knows that his phone is being listened
to.

135
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,889
If he says something,

136
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,240
it might not be good for his family.

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,150
He has a very young family in China.

138
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,759
I have a half brother who’s eight this year.

139
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,879
That’s very, very serious heavy stuff.

140
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,360
I’m curious:

141
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,050
So you’ve been such a heartfelt and dedicated
person

142
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,069
promoting human rights in China,

143
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,820
and you know, when I see that kind of passion,

144
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,280
I can’t help but be suspicious.

145
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,340
What’s really behind what you’re up to?

146
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,960
Or do you have any dark secrets from your
past?

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,099
Like what kind?

148
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,439
Well, I mean I heard…

149
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,699
Now you’re talking, you’re speaking up

150
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,610
against the Communist Party in China,

151
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,069
but I remember hearing that you used to be

152
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,759
a student council leader.

153
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,800
A Young Pioneer?

154
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,140
A Young Pioneer.

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,720
Yeah, I did that for a few years.

156
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,830
It was an intriguing experience,

157
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,800
because at the time I really didn’t know
what I was doing.

158
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,669
I mean, I felt like I did,

159
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,680
and it felt pretty awesome at the time,

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
because you’re the elite group.

161
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,560
But then only after I went to Canada did I
realize that

162
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,560
all I was doing was kind of brainwashing other
students.

163
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,120
And there’s nothing glorious about it.

164
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,869
I think that kind of partly motivated me to

165
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,779
try to let the rest of the Chinese people
know

166
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,999
what they’re going through.

167
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,860
So now you’re trying to brainwash people
with the truth?

168
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,409
I hope that I’m just presenting another
side of facts,

169
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,129
information that I wasn’t able to get

170
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,939
to make it available to them

171
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,259
and they can make their own choice.

172
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,139
And do you feel that message has gotten into
China,

173
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,979
with all the state-run media?

174
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,439
I think it has.

175
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,039
Actually, there are a lot of Chinese people
who climb over

176
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,900
the Great Firewall to see information outside.

177
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,550
And I remember last time when I went to Taiwan

178
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,039
for a conference about religious freedom,

179
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,180
I met a Chinese tourist group in the airport,

180
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,079
and they all wanted to take pictures with
me.

181
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,709
And I felt quite surprised that they were

182
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,600
able to read about it.

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,940
And they told me that although the national
media

184
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:50,860
would write one side of the story,

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,500
they can pretty much get what it was about.

186
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,630
This girl must have said something that the
commies didn’t like.

187
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,579
Wow, I’m very encouraged to see that

188
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,500
angering the Chinese Communist Party can

189
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,490
give someone so many opportunities.

190
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,870
I hope you’ll give me a few tips after
the interview.

191
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,440
I’m sure you have gotten a lot of

192
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,349
opportunities because of it.

193
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:14,759
Oh,

194
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,551
yes.

195
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,600
People love me, it’s true, it’s true.

196
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,000
I’m thinking I could do pretty well in a
beauty pageant myself.

197
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,100
Yeah.

198
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,560
Yeah. Thank you, thank you.

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,700
Thanks for that support.

200
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,290
I’ll use that in my pamphlets that I…

201
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,050
[when] Miss World Canada promotes me as a
beauty pageant [contestant].

202
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
So I understand you’re an actress,

203
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,310
and that you have a new film coming out later
this year.

204
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,160
Yeah, it’s called The Bleeding Edge.

205
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,560
Well, we have a clip of that, so why don’t
we play that.

206
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,020
Well, that certainly looked exciting.

207
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,199
It gave me all kinds of feels.

208
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,750
Why do you think this is an important movie,

209
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,370
an important topic?

210
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,020
Well, it talks about one of the most sensitive
topics

211
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,250
in regards to the Chinese Communist Party
now:

212
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,830
It's the organ harvesting of prisoners of
conscience.

213
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:46,480
After talking to victims, I realized that
this is something that

214
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,720
you know, perhaps I will have to work up my
courage to do.

215
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,620
Well it sounds like it’s a good thing you
did,

216
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,620
because as I understand, you were nominated
for the

217
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,990
Best Actress Award in the upcoming Leo Awards.

218
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,740
That’s one of Canada’s biggest screen
awards, correct?

219
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes, I feel quite honored.

220
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,480
So, actress, beauty pageant, what is next
for you?

221
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,900
Well I have two documentaries coming out about my experience in Hong Kong.

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,480
It does address the bigger issue of

223
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,730
suppression of freedom of conscience in China,

224
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,389
which is something I think urgently needs
to be addressed.

225
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,089
And I’m going to continue to act in more
films.

226
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,020
Great. And…

227
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,400
And I’m running for Miss World this year.

228
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,380
Ah, so, what is this going to be?

229
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,320
So because of last year’s visa denial,

230
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:45,069
Miss World offered me the spot for Canada
in the 2016 Miss World.

231
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,469
And they have confirmed it recently.

232
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,660
So Miss World, the larger organization, not
just Miss World Canada?

233
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,680
Yes.

234
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,860
They had offered it to me last year.

235
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,750
I didn’t know if I was going to take it
at that time,

236
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,129
but I think since I continued on this platform,

237
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,350
I initiated it,

238
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,710
I should continue.

239
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,120
And it’s a great platform.

240
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,699
It’s called “Beauty with a Purpose,”
right?

241
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,850
So Miss World Canada confirmed my spot.

242
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,810
It’s a great sacrifice for them.

243
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,649
So they just gave you the Miss World Canada
position,

244
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:16,959
almost like you’ve been elected

245
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,039
Beauty Queen for Life.

246
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,190
I wish. Well, I…

247
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,040
I mean, I just,

248
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,579
you talk about democracy, and yet

249
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,479
you’re a queen, a beauty queen.

250
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,840
Some media called me the “badass beauty
queen.”

251
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,440
I feel quite honored to be crowned that.

252
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,180
I’m not comfortable with that kind of language
on this show.

253
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,301
This is a family show.

254
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,620
Oh, I’m sorry.

255
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,560
They were quite strong, but I think it’s
an accurate description.

256
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,800
Wow, I hope somebody writes that about me
someday soon.

257
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,560
Just say you agree.

258
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,669
We can Photoshop that in, I’m sure.

259
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,060
So, how do you think this coming year

260
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,180
will be different from the previous year?

261
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,360
We don’t know where it’s going to be held
yet.

262
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,140
Ah.

263
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,279
Yes. I hope it’s going to be in a country
where

264
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,519
freedom of speech is encouraged.

265
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,180
Oh, so China, right?

266
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,040
I mean, it’s in the constitution, they have freedom of speech.

267
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,079
Well, anyway, I hope it’s not going to be
in China,

268
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,620
but anything can happen.

269
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,709
In history, there were three times—

270
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,000
the final three years in a row that it was
held in China before.

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,709
So it could happen this year.

272
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,000
I hope not. I don’t want to be denied twice.

273
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,139
I’m actually a little surprised.

274
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,600
I would have thought they would’ve wanted to sweep this thing under the table

275
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,879
since it caused such an uproar for the pageant,
but…

276
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,279
Well, I think it’s great for them to offer
this opportunity,

277
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,579
and I hope this year they will make the right
choice,

278
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,720
since they know that repressive regimes

279
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,750
fundamentally don’t agree with us, in our
values.

280
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,579
So I don’t think they’re going to choose
China again.

281
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:01,980
We’ll see.

282
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,360
Well, I guess you are the representation of

283
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,860
“Beauty with a Purpose.”

284
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,640
Thank you.

285
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,960
Well thank you for joining us, Anastasia.

286
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,199
The film is called The Bleeding Edge.

287
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,550
It’s coming out later this year.

288
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,000
If you want to be notified when you can watch
it,

289

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,689
more like Anastasia Lin?
