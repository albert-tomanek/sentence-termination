00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,380
when you hear “the North Korea of Africa”,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,200
I know what you’re thinking:

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,160
What a great place to invest!

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,100
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,740
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,480
The Chinese Communist Party has decided to
try its hand

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,829
at a little good old fashioned colonialism
in Africa.

9
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,439
Besides burying many Africa countries in debt
traps,

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,220
the Chinese regime also plans to build up
its military there.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,180
Sadly, a lot of African countries are run
by dictators.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,070
And it’s hard for dictators to get the support
they want from the West.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,390
That’s where the Chinese Communist Party
steps in.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,530
They don’t make unreasonable demands,

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,820
like to improve human rights and democracy!

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,770
They give the dictators cash—

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,100
plus sell them security technology

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,560
so they can keep an iron grip on power.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,280
A perfect example of this is Eritrea.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,980
You know, Eritrea!

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,320
Okay, a lot of people have never heard of
Eritrea.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,500
But the Chinese Communist Party sure has.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,210
It’s a small country on the horn of Africa,

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,600
right next to Djibouti,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,220
where China put its first overseas military
base.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,370
The modern country of Eritrea

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,600
only gained independence in 1991,

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,440
after a long war to separate from Ethiopia.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,420
And what did the newly liberated people get?

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,659
A brutal dictatorship!

31
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,790
To learn more about China’s role in Eritrea,

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,980
I sat down with Meron Estafanos,

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,760
an Eritrean activist and journalists,

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,409
now living in Sweden.

35
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:36,460
We met on the sidelines of the Oslo Freedom
Forum in New York.

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,480
Thank you so much for joining us today.

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
Thank you for having me.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,409
So, for our audience who maybe doesn't know
much about Eritrea,

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,920
how would you describe it?

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,080
Eritrea is a 27 year old country that never
had election.

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,090
There's only one party, one state media.

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,740
There's no free press.

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,010
It's referred as the North Korea of Africa.

44
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,130
North Korea of Africa.

45
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,500
Yeah and it literally is.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Wow.

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,310
Yeah. So that's how I can describe it, in
short.

48
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,560
Do you have to call your leader,

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,890
dear leader, like in North Korea?

50
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,160
We don't use it, but the whole country is
a militarized state

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,220
where about 27% of the population is in the
military

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,520
so everybody from the age of 15, 16 until
you are 50,

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,150
you belong to the government.

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,620
So in the name of the national service

55
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,880
it's supposed to be 18 months,

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,690
originally planned for 18 months, it became
indefinite.

57
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,810
Indefinite military conscription.

58
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,810
Exactly.

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,910
As I understand it, a lot of people like to
leave the country

60
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,830
before they have to serve.

61
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah, sadly you know we see.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
I mean 15 years ago the people that was fleeing
from Eritrea

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,629
was 30 plus educated people, whatever you
know,

64
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:08,239
and then 10 years later it became 20 plus
and then now,

65
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,550
the last seven years all I see is children
as young as seven.

66
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,550
Wow.

67
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,520
Unaccompanied, fleeing and these kids are
very realistic

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,650
because they know the father is in the military

69
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,709
and your six older siblings are in the military,

70
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,900
so you know your fate is like in a few years,
that will be you.

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,450
So, already at age seven, children understand
this and they just flee,

72
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,030
which is really shocking to me.

73
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,760
So military service is not a great thing in
Eritrea.

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,650
I mean like imagine military service, when
we say military service,

75
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:50,040
first of all, at the age of 16, you're not
mature enough

76
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,150
so you don't even have any knowledge.

77
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,150
That's the time where you gain a lot of knowledge
from your family,

78
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,500
from your society.

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,220
So they are separating you from wherever you
grew up

80
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,950
and then they will take you in the middle
of nowhere,

81
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,030
train you and then they will assign you

82
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,770
in any kind of work so it could be,

83
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,440
it's mainly slavery.

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,540
That's how I can describe it because imagine
being a woman,

85
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,270
you are 16, and then you are doing the last
year of your high school.

86
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,350
You have to do it at the military camp,

87
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,490
which is in the middle of nowhere.

88
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,020
From there, you are being brainwashed and
also you have no culture,

89
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,130
you have no knowledge as the rest of the people
or the older generation.

90
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,840
So at the camps the only thing you know is

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,050
you become a yes man or a yes woman.

92
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,960
Everything is decided when you have to go
up,

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,690
when you have to sleep, what you have to do.

94
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,080
Even when you have to go to the toilet,

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,990
you cannot go as you please.

96
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,020
There is a certain time that you can use the
toilet.

97
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,419
What if you have to really go.

98
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,370
It doesn't matter, then you have to let it
go on yourself.

99
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,560
So it's an incredibly repressive government
too.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,620
Very, very.

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,410
So, maybe there's a lot of people in the world

102
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,580
that don't know much about Eritrea

103
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,490
but the Chinese Communist Party has been interested
in Eritrea

104
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,880
for a long time.

105
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,380
Why is that?

106
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,290
I mean, the relationship with Eritrea and
China g

107
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,360
oes back actually back in the late 50's,

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,990
that's when Eritreans that were activists
were being sent off to China,

109
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,650
being trained in China.

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,570
Even our president, in 1961,

111
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,460
actually was in China was taught by Chinese.

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,420
So during the struggle for independence it
was basically that

113
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,100
what they were running was Mao style kind
of.

114
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,480
Kind of Maoist, Marxist, guerrilla.

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

116
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Okay.

117
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,730
So it goes long time but now with China's
influence in Africa.

118
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,900
China is everywhere at this time, especially
in Africa.

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,090
With Eritrea, the influence is not that much
but it's starting.

120
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,449
They bought this mining company and the same
mining company

121
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:17,220
is accused of forced labor because instead
of hiring independent people,

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,060
so they are using the conscripts to work in
these companies,

123
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,780
as part of their national service.

124
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,040
Oh. So they're not even taking Chinese workers
to work,

125
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,370
they're just using...

126
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,150
Local people, the conscripts.

127
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,150
So this is like.

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,150
Is that like slave labor?

129
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,759
It is slave labor. So here is a case actually
against Nevsun,

130
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,620
which is now owned by Chinese but it was a
Canadian company.

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,320
So there is an ongoing trial in Canada about
this case.

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,110
Some of the conscripts that managed to flee
actually

133
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,080
sued the company and it's an ongoing case
right now.

134
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh. Well Eritrea is also located in a pretty
strategic location.

135
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah.

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,470
Is there a benefit for Chinese military projection,
do you think?

137
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah, I mean like you see slowly,

138
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,260
the relationship with China in Eritrea is
growing.

139
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,330
I can give you an example.

140
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,790
Just a few months ago I was contacted

141
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,819
by Eritrean journalist who was in China.

142
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,319
I was like, "What are you doing in China?"

143
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,330
He said, "No, we are sent to China to do journalism
course".

144
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,270
I was like, really?

145
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,210
Journalism in China, okay.

146
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,840
Yeah. So anyways he wanted to defect and he
was like,

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,789
"I don't want to go back to Eritrea I want
to stay here",

148
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,080
and it was impossible and we couldn't find
an NGO

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
that could help him and the Chinese government,

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,080
they actually collaborated with Eritrea government

151
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,740
and held his passport.

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,800
So, it was like one of the toughest cases
that

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,889
I've been involved and at last in order to
get his passport

154
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,729
what we did was we sent him some money and
then he asked,

155
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,870
"I need my passport in order to take out the
money

156
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,139
that I received through western union",

157
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,949
and then they contacted and they were following
him around everywhere.

158
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,660
They knew this guy wanted to defect,

159
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,449
so they informed the Eritrea government

160
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,930
that this guy is trying to change his flight.

161
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,509
So the Eritrea government told them,

162
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,979
make sure that he boards the same flight as
we booked him.

163
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:19,979
Wow.

164
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,509
Then we said, "Okay you go ahead",

165
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,160
because he has transit in Egypt.

166
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,810
So we got him a new ticket from Egypt to Japan

167
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,949
instead of to Eritrea

168
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,000
because he refused to let him buy a new ticket.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,429
That's how far the relationship is getting
stronger right now.

170
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,629
Wow. And you were telling me before about

171
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:39,319
an interesting encounter you had on a plane
ride.

172
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,319
Yeah.

173
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,319
Why don't you tell us a bit about that?

174
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:47,790
I just got back from Africa and from Mali

175
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,360
and I was sitting next to two Chinese men,

176
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,110
and we started talking, very friendly.

177
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,660
Normally, when you meet Chinese they are reserved
people.

178
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,720
It takes some time to talk,

179
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,980
but this guy just start talking to me and
so he told me

180
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,360
he was a professor at this business university
in China

181
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,999
and then the second person that was sitting
next to him

182
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,319
was from the Chinese government.

183
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,369
So, I asked what were you doing in Mali.

184
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,989
They said now we just came here to see

185
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,329
what kind of investment that we can do.

186
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:23,680
They had a meeting with the Mali government
which is Mali right now,

187
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,410
a very terrible, what can I say.

188
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,319
The situation in Mali is not that good right
now,

189
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,119
to invest, to be honest.

190
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,899
But still they are interested.

191
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,009
So, they were showing me how they were interviewed

192
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:43,769
by the Mali TV and things like that and then
we spent like nine hours.

193
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,550
The professor was trying to convince me how
a one party system is great.

194
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,550
I was like, come on.

195
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,550
Just like in Eritrea.

196
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,550
Yeah. I said,

197
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,929
"I'm from Eritrea so don't try to tell me

198
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,739
what one party system means".

199
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,230
He said, "No it's good for business",

200
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,439
and so we kept arguing about this and he says,

201
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,949
"Why don't you come to China" and I said,

202
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,629
"I wouldn't. If I come to China I know I would
be arrested

203
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,949
by your government because I'm a very outspoken
person".

204
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:10,199
I'll see something I don't like. I'll speak
up.

205
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,399
I have no guarantee. You get the point.

206
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,019
Would they send you back to Eritrea, you think?

207
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,429
I don't know whatever they can do but I just
told him

208
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:19,129
that I wouldn't feel comfortable visiting
China,

209
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:23,360
plus I have many Chinese activities.

210
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,949
So he wanted to know we kept discussing about
it.

211
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,660
A lot of argument about the one party system,

212
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,379
business and things and so but then you would
see w

213
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,550
hen the guy from the government was asleep,

214
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,879
the professor kind of agreed with me, you
know.

215
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,470
He maybe had a different point of view

216
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,470
when the government guy wasn't watching.

217
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,690
He didn't say anything bad,

218
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,290
but he kind of agreed with my argument.

219
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,059
I was really surprised the guy from the government,

220
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,290
at first I didn't know he was from the government.

221
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,209
His english was very fluent.

222
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,209
Wow.

223
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,420
Sounded like American. I was, like wow, no
accent nothing

224
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,739
and he's never been in the U.S.

225
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,739
That's impressive.

226
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,309
Yeah. Then I found out that he was from the
government side.

227
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,559
So what they did is they visited Mali,

228
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,029
trying to see what kind of investment

229
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,220
they can do and then they would go back,

230
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,189
offer to the people, which offering the people
would mean

231
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,749
they are just making 20%, the rest the government
would make it.

232
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:27,749
So that kind of.

233
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,230
So the investment is not really helping the
locals.

234
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,350
Yeah. It never does.

235
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,889
The thing is also to me,

236
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,870
one thing I understood about all African countries,

237
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,160
if they hire a professor in any university,
i

238
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,209
t's always Indian and if it's business it's
always Chinese.

239
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,029
So my understanding is, after this,

240
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,069
I came to this understanding after years actually,

241
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,519
that it's because African dictators choose
Chinese

242
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,629
and the Indians because they will never speak
about human rights.

243
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,360
They will never talk about.

244
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,509
The Indian just want to make his money.

245
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,720
He doesn't involve, even though he's a professor,

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,949
he's teaching people but he doesn't want to
teach at the same time,

247
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:09,949
compared to the situation.

248
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:11,679
They're always very quiet.

249
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,679
They only work themselves,

250
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,389
so they try to stay neutral which is really
sad.

251
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,989
And they have the Chinese who will never discuss

252
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,540
because they will claim even when you meet
them.

253
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,620
I was in Egypt last week as well and I met
another investor,

254
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,649
a Chinese one, who's actually doing a good
job,

255
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,449
like he's buying old recycled bags and selling
it off.

256
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,449
Okay.

257
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:37,269
But even he was an independent person,

258
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,459
he was trying to tell me how great the one
party system is.

259
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,459
Yes.

260
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,389
So that's the kind of mentality that you see
as long,

261
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,529
so that means you're not betray the African
dictators,

262
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,510
so that's why they prefer Indian teachers
and Chinese investors.

263
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,170
Well, I'm curious because a lot of aid

264
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,910
that comes from the U.S. or other Western
nations

265
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,329
often comes with demands for improved human
rights.

266
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,699
When China is offering that kind of aid or
financial investment,

267
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,429
are human rights ever on the table.

268
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,929
No, not at all. Not at all.

269
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:09,929
Wow.

270
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,299
It's always funny whenever I'm speaking at
the human rights counsel,

271
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:18,079
it's always China that will oppose whatever
it is that we say.

272
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,489
Even though you're bringing proof,

273
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,850
you're telling, you're bringing victims of
their Eritrea government,

274
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,949
but it's always China will oppose any kind
of, you know.

275
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:28,949
So they're really helping support.

276
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,029
Or they will abstain from voting.

277
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,139
Yeah, so they're really helping support the
Eritrea dictatorship.

278
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,370
Of course they do.

279
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,809
It's always, if Eritrea is raised up

280
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,490
in the Human Rights Council in Geneva,

281
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,730
it's always North Korea and China

282
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,959
that will oppose the rest of the countries.

283
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,589
It's always like that.

284
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,119
Gosh. And so what's the feeling in Eritrea

285
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:54,089
about the Chinese workers and investors who
are in the country?

286
00:13:54,089 --> 00:14:00,040
As far for the people I mean, nothing really.

287
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,059
The people don't really understand.

288
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,160
Okay.

289
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,589
So the ones that are educated do understand
what it means.

290
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,419
The thing with the Chinese is any country

291
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:14,569
would be happy to have investors but with
China,

292
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,109
they're not even giving you work

293
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:18,259
because they are bringing their own people.

294
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,579
So they are taking jobs from the local people.

295
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,239
They are empowering the dictatorships by investing
in the country,

296
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,680
like the mining companies right now for example.

297
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,899
That's like a pump to the Eritrea government.

298
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,190
It's prolonging our suffering.

299
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,879
So they are being an accomplice of many crimes,

300
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,230
when you are investing and you are providing
money to the dictatorship,

301
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,449
you are prolonging our suffering.

302
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,509
That's the way I look at it.

303
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,019
And do you have any thoughts at all about
how China's one belt,

304
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,600
one road initiative is affecting Africa as
a whole?

305
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,009
It is and the sad part is even the material

306
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,389
that they're selling it, in Africa,

307
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:06,279
is not even a material that you can use a
month.

308
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,679
We have many China products here in U.S.,

309
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,809
in Europe. I mean those things will at least
last you a year,

310
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:21,799
but in Africa they will give you the worst
materials that you can have.

311
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,669
They are taking jobs from you and at the same
time,

312
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,600
they are ripping you off.

313
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,660
So that's what I see in every African country
right now,

314
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
wherever you go.

315
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,869
In Eritrea they don't even want to pay taxes,

316
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,009
so what they do is,

317
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,979
they want to get married to an Eritrean woman

318
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,429
because if you marry an Eritrean,

319
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,189
if you have a child from an Eritrean,

320
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,769
then you will be an Eritrea citizen.

321
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,809
So they always try to become Eritrea citizens.

322
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,470
So they will offer some woman,

323
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,429
if you have a child for me.

324
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,920
I'll buy you a big house.

325
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,609
Wow. It also makes sense because inside of
China

326
00:15:57,609 --> 00:15:59,399
there's a shortage of women.

327
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
Yeah.

328
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,220
Because of years of sex selective abortion

329
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,259
from the one child policy.

330
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,729
So it seems like they're solving this problem
abroad.

331
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:08,729
Yeah.

332
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:10,449
Oh my goodness.

333
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,939
Also, as I understand it, the Chinese Communist
Party

334
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,459
supported the Eritrea Liberation Front

335
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,850
and the Eritrea People's Liberation Front.

336
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,100
The groups that were very active in the independence
movement.

337
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,739
Do you know anything about that?

338
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,229
Yeah, that's like earlier.

339
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:26,899
As I said like with our president

340
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,989
and many of the top Cadres, as we call them.

341
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,109
You use the term Cadres.

342
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,309
Okay.

343
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:40,870
They were trained in China so when you look
at our president,

344
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,970
he reminds me more of Mao.

345
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,049
Like when the people in China were starving,

346
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,660
Mao was sending food to other countries

347
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,959
like in Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia

348
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,579
and things and our president was doing the
same thing.

349
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:55,799
Really.

350
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,660
Just a few years, two year, three years ago,

351
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,049
there was a starvation going on in the whole
horn of Africa

352
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:02,629
and he refused to admit that

353
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,419
we were there was also hunger in Eritrea.

354
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:06,889
So he denied it.

355
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,179
He wouldn't allow an independent entity

356
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,699
to come into the country and see for themselves.

357
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,370
We activists and any Eritrean

358
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,539
knew that there was starvation in the country.

359
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:22,110
So instead what he did was send lots of tons
of food to Somalia.

360
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,089
Just to prove that there was no hunger in
Eritrea.

361
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,089
Wow.

362
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,009
Even though the people were starving.

363
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:30,450
Jeez. So what would you like to see the rest
of the world do

364
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,580
in Eritrea or Africa in general?

365
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,299
I mean, not the rest of the world but I hope
Africans

366
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:44,470
will finally wake up and get rid of the dictatorships

367
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,259
because we are the reason where we are.

368
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,049
All our problems, I don't blame it on our
president

369
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,240
but we did make him the person that he is
today

370
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,929
because we allowed so many abuses to continue.

371
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,539
At last, it became that every family has lost
someone

372
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,929
or has a family member that's in prison.

373
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,600
The same thing in all African countries

374
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,460
but now it seems like finally Africans are
rising up.

375
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,590
So we're seeing more and more people

376
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,570
are protesting all over Africa

377
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,000
and I hope that the next generation

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,039
will lead Africa into another direction,

379
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,530
into a more democratic Africa.

380
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,620
That's what I dream and I think that's what
Africans have to do.

381
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,870
The same thing goes for China as well.

382
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,870
That's my hope,

383
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,330
that more and more people will speak about
that.

384
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,690
That's a very encouraging and optimistic way

385
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,790
to end the interview, I think.

386
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,330
So thank you very much for joining us.

387
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,820
It was a pleasure to have you on.

388
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,460
My pleasure to be here as well.

389
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,500
Thank you for having me.

390
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,720
Absolutely and if our audience would like
to learn more about Eritrea,

391
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,390
what would you recommend?

392
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:02,299
Start with Googling Eritrea and there is the
security council,

393
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:03,370
there was a commission of inquiry.

394
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,650
There is a report, two reports,

395
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:13,700
and it said in the reports Eritrea is committing
crimes against humanity

396
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,080
so you can read the stories.

397
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,759
What kinds of crimes goes on in Eritrea

398
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,139
and I'm quite sure a lot of people will see

399
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,470
if you happen to come from a dictatorship
country,

400
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,289
then you will see your own country.

401
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,850
Whenever my friends read the report, they
always say,

402
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,850
"I feel like who copied us. Did we copy each
other", kind of thing.

403
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,050
They all similar in many things.

404
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,519
I suggest that anybody interested read the
commission of inquiry report

405
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,230
and there are many other books.

406
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,190
Just Google Eritrea and you will see a lot
of things.

407
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,450
Alright. Great, thank you so much.

408
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,660
Thank you for having me.

409
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
Well, sorry to say,

410
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,769
that’s the end of another China Uncensored.

411
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,799
