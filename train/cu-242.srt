00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,420
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,340
Oh no, I think it’s something I ate.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,180
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,880
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,410
China has a reputation for fakery.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,869
Just take my favorite toy of all time,

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:18,869
Robert Cop!

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,039
Hey, he’s the furniture of law enforcement.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,199
Now while Robert Cop may be a bad knock off,

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,099
it’s also hilarious.

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,669
But you know what’s not as hilarious?

12
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,590
Knock-off foods that could kill you

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,900
if you eat them...

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,240
or even worse,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
not kill you,

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,020
but make you wish for the sweet release of
death.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,830
So if you ever travel to China,

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,100
here’s a list of 10 foods to watch out for.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,160
Number 10

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,660
Fake Eggs

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,340
Eggs are cheap right?

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,210
Well fake eggs are even cheaper!

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,570
According to state-run media,

24
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,260
some suspiciously cheap eggs were actually
fakes

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,329
made from industrial chemicals.

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,979
Look, you can’t make a profit

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,479
without breaking some fake eggs.

28
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,119
This video claims to show how the fake eggs
are made.

29
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,780
A combination of resin, starch, coagulant,
pigments,

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,280
and sodium alginate make the egg white.

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,850
The yolk is made with different resins and
pigments.

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,210
And voilà!

33
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,319
You have a fake egg.

34
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,409
Once that’s done, it’s fit into a fake
egg shell,

35
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:25,409
made of paraffin wax,

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,780
gypsum powder and calcium carbonate.

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,219
All you need now is fake bacon.

38
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,219
Number 9

39
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,719
Fake Rice

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,439
Rice is a staple Chinese food.

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,100
But one particular kind of rice

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,170
is extremely popular in China.

43
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,759
It’s called Wuchang rice.

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,659
It has a unique fragrance.

45
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,400
And only about 800,000 tons

46
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,420
are produced each year.

47
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
But somehow,

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,990
10 million tons are sold each year.

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,250
That means 92 percent of it is fake.

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,689
Rice vendors mix a small amount of Wuchang
rice

51
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,759
with cheaper brands and sell it at a markup.

52
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,689
But what about the unique fragrance of Wuchang
rice?

53
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,210
No problem.

54
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,939
Just spray some rice-scented perfume

55
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,500
on the fake Wuchang rice.

56
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,210
Who can tell the difference?

57
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,800
There have even been rumors of rice vendors

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
selling rice that’s actually made of plastic.

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,870
“One Chinese restaurant association official

60
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,990
warns that eating three bowls of ‘plastic
rice’

61
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,520
is the same as eating one vinyl bag.”

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,620
On the plus side, your body can’t digest
vinyl,

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,780
so plastic rice fits in as part of your low-carb
diet.

64
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,140
And it probably tastes better than cauliflower
rice.

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,540
The plastic rice story has never been confirmed,

66
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,130
but considering there are fake eggs,

67
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,440
plastic rice might not be too far fetched.

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Number 8

69
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,810
Fake Pepper

70
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,860
This isn’t anything to sneeze at.

71
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,610
According to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

72
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,210
the black pepper was being made out of mud.

73
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,020
A dirty business.

74
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,340
The white pepper was being made out of flour.

75
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,100
What was the guy’s defense?

76
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,060
“The vendor responsible told reporters

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,490
that selling fake pepper was acceptable,

78
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,900
as the fake seasoning would not kill people.”

79
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,380
Well, in a country with fake eggs,

80
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,770
yeah I’ve got to give him that.

81
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,970
Number 7

82
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,590
Fake Beef

83
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,960
Now at first, this one might not seem so bad

84
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,940
compared to what we’ve just seen.

85
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,320
Over 20,000 kilos of fake beef

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,350
was seized by Chinese authorities

87
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,340
after it was discovered it was actually pork.

88
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,500
Well that’s not so bad, right?

89
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,840
Unless you’re Muslim

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
and it’s a deep violation of your faith.

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,960
But at least the fake beef is still made out
of real meat.

92
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,110
Except, “Police say the confiscated meat

93
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,020
had been treated with chemicals

94
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,740
including paraffin wax and industrial salts

95
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,430
to make it look like beef.”

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,680
Those are ok to eat...right?

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
Well in addition to the uh, additives

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,160
used to make this pork into beef,

99
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,110
let’s just hope they weren’t using

100
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,440
the same kind of pork found in China

101
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,560
that somehow glows in the dark.

102
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,980
I’m sure that’s just from heirloom

103
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,120
glow-in-the-dark pigs.

104
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,190
Number 6

105
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,870
Fake Walnuts

106
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,300
Looks like a real walnut right?

107
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,400
Well, it is a real walnut shell.

108
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,139
But inside...rocks.

109
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,250
Vendors would remove the nut meat

110
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,940
and sell that separately.

111
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,690
Then they would fill up the shells with rocks

112
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,320
or pieces of cement,

113
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,590
glue them together,

114
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,160
and sell that.

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,460
Solving fake foods in China is a tough nut
to crack.

116
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,470
Number 5

117
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,990
Fake Wine

118
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,790
China has a massive fake wine problem.

119
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,030
The Interprofessional Council of Bordeaux
Wine

120
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,910
estimates that 30,000 bottles of fake wine

121
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,230
are sold per hour in China.

122
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,840
Some estimate “that 30 percent of all alcohol
in China

123
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,930
is counterfeit

124
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,010
and 70 percent of wine is fake.”

125
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,210
And lets just say, this fake wine won’t
get you drunk...

126
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,270
“Some of the wines apparently

127
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,320
don’t have fermented grape juice,

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
just sugar water mixed with chemicals,

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,250
like coloring agents and flavoring.”

130
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,820
But it might give you a really bad hangover...

131
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,720
“Some experts were reported as saying the
wine additives

132
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
could cause headaches, irregular heartbeat,
and cancer.”

133
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,760
Wow, that’s a rather extreme range of side
effects.

134
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,240
Almost makes me feel better about…

135
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,570
Number 4

136
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,090
Fake Lamb

137
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,300
Like the fake beef,

138
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,030
the fake lamb was made with real meat.

139
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,770
Just meat from...rats.

140
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,650
Pop quiz!

141
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,230
Which is lamb and which is rat?

142
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,520
You can tell the difference by the fat.

143
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,550
The real lamb,

144
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,310
it’s actually attached,

145
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,690
not just some weird gross strip.

146
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,830
900 were arrested.

147
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,320
That is, 900 people.

148
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,880
The rats weren’t arrested.

149
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,130
They were digested.

150
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,490
In fact, in the first five months of 2013,

151
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,440
authorities seized 20,000 tonnes of illegal
meat products.

152
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,250
To be fair, it wasn’t all rat meat.

153
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,389
Some was simply regular meat

154
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,350
that was toxic or diseased.

155
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,530
Number 3

156
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,530
Fake Tofu

157
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,870
I know, who in their right mind

158
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,600
would eat tofu anyway?

159
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,620
Well, here’s one more reason

160
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,550
not to touch the stuff—

161
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,790
100 metric tons of toxic tofu.

162
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,850
The counterfeiters said they mixed the chemicals

163
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,550
with water, salt and MSG before steaming the
mixture,

164
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,890
packaging it and giving it a brand name.

165
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,889
And one of the chemical agents used is known
to cause cancer.

166
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,940
“Oh ee ohh, killer tofu.”

167
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,700
Number 2

168
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,440
Fake Duck blood

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,940
Oh no!

170
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,160
Not duck blood!

171
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,350
Don’t tell me they’ve turned this delicacy

172
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,330
into something disgusting!

173
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,169
In this report from my favorite state run
media,

174
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,229
the Global Times, they...

175
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:55,790
well first they compare Chinese people to
vampires.

176
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,229
Now I know how Angelababy

177
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,110
keeps her skin so white!

178
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,010
But the Global Times article also warns,

179
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,260
“watch out for fake blood.”

180
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,920
“All sorts of harmful ingredients are added,

181
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,400
including formaldehyde, which is toxic

182
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,690
and damages the liver, kidneys and nerves.”

183
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,410
And you don’t want nerve damage.

184
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,870
Because you’ll need a lot of nerve

185
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,690
to eat coagulated cakes of animal blood.

186
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,240
And finally, Number 1

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,570
Fake Pork Buns

188
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,810
This report from state run CCTV revealed

189
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,010
that some people were making delicious pork
buns...

190
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,790
out of well marinated cardboard.

191
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,960
The cardboard is soaked in caustic soda,

192
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,680
a chemical base commonly used in

193
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,050
manufacturing paper and soap.

194
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,000
Mmm, the longer it marinates the better.

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
The story got picked up by Western media

196
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,100
and went viral.

197
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,090
Chinese authorities were quick to act...

198
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,160
by arresting the reporter and claiming

199
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,389
she made up the story for views.

200
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,860
She was fined and sent to prison for a year.

201
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,520
But while the cardboard pork buns

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,949
may or may not have been a hoax,

203
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,300
some inventive entrepreneurs came up with

204
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,650
“recycled” pork buns instead.

205
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,139
You know, you take some expired pork buns,

206
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,990
freshen them up with a little flour and water,

207
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,990
repackage them,

208
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,100
and they’re good as new!

209
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,990
So those are 10 fake Chinese foods

210
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,880
that may kill you.

211
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,669
Those who live by the yum,

212
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,490
die by the yum.

213
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,490
And before you go,

214
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,509
now’s the time on the show

215
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,610
when I answer questions from fans

216
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,199
who support China Uncensored

217
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,550
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

218
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,270
This one comes from Arpanet-at-Cern.

219
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,370
Hey Chris, do you think the US would ever
implement

220
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,200
AI Facial Recognition nationally like China?

221
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,849
I’d like to think not.

222
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:44,930
The United States government

223
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,560
is still accountable to the people

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,940
and I don’t think the people here would
appreciate

225
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,950
a proverbial eye of Sauron spying on them

226
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,610
at all times.

227
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,200
However, China is exporting its surveillance

228
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,770
and censorship technology to other countries.

229
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,800
For example, Africa.

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,660
Ok, technically Africa is a continent.

231
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,450
I meant African countries.

232
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,440
Turns out, most oppressive regimes

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,270
enjoy money and power—

234
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,790
and the Chinese Communist Party

235
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,100
is more than happy to supply those things
to them.

236
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,380
There’s also fears that China’s social
credit system,

237
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,370
where citizens are given a ranking based on
behavior,

238
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,940
could be coming to the west as well.

239
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,860
But you know what, Arpanet-at-Cern?

240
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,440
I think you’ve given me a great idea for
a full episode.

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,050
So remember, if you’d like to have me

242
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,120
answer your questions on the show,

243
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,370
support China Uncensored with a dollar or
more

244
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,200
per episode on Patreon.

245
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
The show is mostly funded by you,

246
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,870
the viewers.

247
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,980
Thanks for watching.

248
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Let me know what you think about

249
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,480
fake foods in China

250
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,730
and if you’ve encountered any

251
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,060
while travelling there.

252
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,370
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

253
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,540
see you next time.

254
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
Hey, want the latest China news?

255
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,440
Subscribe to China Uncensored!

256
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,860
And turn that notification bell on

257
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,399
to make sure you find out

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,140
when new episodes are out.

259
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,491
We publish a brand new episode

260
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,070
every Monday,Wednesday, and Friday—

261
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,029
and sometimes Saturday.

262
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,140
So check back frequently.

263
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,020
But I’ve heard from many fans

264
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,440
that YouTube won’t notify you,

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,450
even if you have notifications on.

266
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,880
I guess they don’t like China Uncensored
too much.
