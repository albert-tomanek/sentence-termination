1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,479
South Africa signs 93 economic and trade deals
with China

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:09,330
Worth over $1.7 billion dollars

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,679
China is South Africa’s biggest trading
partner and biggest investor

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,920
But South Africa’s deepening ties with China
have other consequences

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,340
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,160
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,380
China has been cozying up to South Africa
for a long time.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,879
But like just about everything in life,

9
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,629
that chummy economic and trade relationship

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,920
has unforeseen consequences.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,079
And to take viewers on a deeper dive into

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,129
China's growing presence in South Africa is
Shelley Zhang,

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,489
who traveled to Johannesburg.

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:48,859
Thanks Chris.

15
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,359
As soon as I landed in South Africa,

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,809
signs of China-Africa cooperation were everywhere.

17
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,010
Since 2010, China has been South Africa's
biggest trade partner.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,339
Now, China is also South Africa’s single
biggest investor.

19
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,240
China clearly sees South Africa,

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,590
with its development, infrastructure, and
location,

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,130
as a gateway to the rest of the continent.

22
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,830
And the two countries are in the middle

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,820
of a pretty intense honeymoon period.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,770
But there are already signs that the relationship
could easily go sour.

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,890
In June 2019, China and South Africa signed

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,079
93 economic and trade cooperation deals

27
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,439
worth 1.7 billion dollars.

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,960
That was also when Chinese leader Xi Jinping

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,150
and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa
met during

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,650
the G20 summit in Japan.

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,649
And the South African president...

32
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,280
grabbed Xi Jinping's chest while Putin looked
on?

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,979
What is going on here?

34
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,740
Please don’t tell me.

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,530
But it’s clear that Xi and Ramaphosa have
a connection.

36
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,100
I mean, Xi Jinping looks...almost happy.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,460
Maybe that’s because he knows that President
Ramaphosa,

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,670
and his political party, the ANC,

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,590
are strong supporters of the Chinese Communist
Party.

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,979
In fact, back in 2015,

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,440
the ANC called the Chinese Communist Party

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,430
a “guiding lodestar” for the ANC

43
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,400
because of their economic reforms in China.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,409
And the support goes both ways.

45
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,080
China’s ambassador to South Africa said
that

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,370
“President Cyril Ramaphosa is the last hope
of this country.”

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,739
That’s in reference to Ramaphosa’s drive

48
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,550
to bring in 100 billion dollars of new investment

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,830
to lift South Africa’s economy out of a
slump.

50
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,640
And most of what they’ve raised so far is
from—

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,840
you guessed it—China!

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,290
Like the $2.5 billion loan to the heavily
indebted

53
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,129
state-owned power company Eskom.

54
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,739
But a big focus for the two countries is trade.

55
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,180
Like those 93 trade agreements I mentioned
earlier.

56
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,670
One thing these deals are supposed to do is
to fix

57
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,500
a trade imbalance between the two countries.

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,200
Currently, 85% of what China buys from South
Africa

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,650
are minerals and metals.

60
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,650
T

61
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,270
hey’re sucking up South Africa’s natural
resources.

62
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,269
And what does China sell to South Africa?

63
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,630
Manufactured goods.

64
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,610
Like here at Johannesburg's China Mall.

65
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,160
Or at Oriental Plaza...

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,300
...where you can get a bargain on China Green
tea,

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,099
or communist Che Guevera shirts

68
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,590
or random cookware.

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,739
I’m not a big fan.

70
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,470
While this is great for China,

71
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,689
it’s less great for South Africa,

72
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,280
since cheap imports can affect local industries.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,129
That’s a structural imbalance

74
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,500
that South Africa's trade minister wants to
reset.

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,959
Most of the imported goods at places like
China Mall

76
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,000
are from small mom-and-pop businesses.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,300
There are around half a million Chinese people
in South Africa.

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,940
At first, most immigrants were actually Taiwanese.

79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,890
They came from Taiwan in the 1970s and 80s,

80
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,409
when South Africa had an official relationship
with Taiwan.

81
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,159
Then starting 20 years ago,

82
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,640
they were replaced by economic migrants from
mainland China.

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,129
Now, these small-mom-and-pop importers are
leaving.

84
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,220
I talked to several who told me business isn’t
what it used to be.

85
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,770
But as these small Chinese entrepreneurs leave,

86
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,340
they’re being replaced by...the Chinese
state.

87
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,850
That is, huge Chinese state-owned enterprises,

88
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,639
and big businesses supported by the state.

89
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,160
Which is why South Africa is getting its 5G
infrastructure from—

90
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,960
you guessed it—Huawei.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,639
The...other Huawei.

92
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,000
Another example is state-owned Beijing Automotive
Industrial Corporation’s

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,990
new auto assembly plant in Port Elizabeth.

94
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,550
The company, known by its acronym BAIC,

95
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,640
is supposed to source around 30% of auto components
from local companies.

96
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,290
Does the auto manufacturing benefit South
Africa?

97
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,290
Sure.

98
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,500
"And it's beginning already now to make a
difference

99
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,080
to the employment situation of young people."

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,540
But the auto plant, which can source the remaining

101
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,990
70% of car components from outside of South
Africa,

102
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,740
could provide outsized benefits for China.

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,870
"Where a Chinese company partners with a South
African company

104
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,470
and manufactures here in South Africa,

105
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,530
a great opportunity is presented to export
duty free

106
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,600
into the rest of the African continent,

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,639
into the European Union, and into the United
States,

108
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,000
through our favorable trade agreements.”

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,860
So basically, Chinese companies can exploit
South Africa's

110
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,620
free or near-free market access to flood the
rest of the continent,

111
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,310
as well as Europe and the US,

112
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,220
with cheap cars that could be assembled mostly
from parts made in China.

113
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,550
But it’s not just about trade and investment.

114
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,190
China and South Africa are also cooperating,
along with Russia,

115
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,270
on military exercises.

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,690
Part of the PLA’s goal to develop a blue-water
navy.

117
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,280
And South African police are also being trained
in China.

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,440
But perhaps the biggest potential problem

119
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,990
with South Africa’s growing ties to China

120
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,910
is political influence by the Chinese Communist
Party.

121
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,230
Like when South Africa’s president recently
came out in defense of Huawei.

122
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,919
And he blasted the US as backwards-thinking
and jealous

123
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,910
in its fight against the company.

124
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:25,150
“The United States is unable to imagine
a better future

125
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,350
that goes beyond 4 plus one G.

126
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:38,160
They are unable to imagine what 5G can offer...

127
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,970
They are jealous that a Chinese company called
Huawei

128
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,110
has outstripped them.”

129
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,259
So clearly, South Africa doesn’t share America’s
security concerns.

130
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,300
Meanwhile, back in 2017,

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,449
the South African Minister of Public Service
and Administration

132
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,990
lavished praise on Xi Jinping's book on socialism
for a new era

133
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,099
and called him "the most powerful leader on
earth”

134
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,440
and also very “humble”.

135
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,669
"President Xi Jinping’s words surpass in
value

136
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,669
even the most the precious of metals.”

137
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:18,099
I guess that’s why South Africa is giving
its precious metals to China,

138
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,639
in exchange for Xi Jinping’s very valuable
words.

139
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
Now it’s interesting that if you look for
information

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,180
on China and South Africa’s relationship,

141
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,740
you don’t find that many critical opinions.

142
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,110
Maybe that’s because they’re still on
their honeymoon,

143
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,669
so everything’s still going well.

144
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,180
Or maybe it’s because China is buying African
media’s silence.

145
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,800
A columnist at a South African paper was fired

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,620
after writing an opinion piece about the Uyghurs,

147
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,800
the Turkic Muslim minority being put in concentration
camps in China.

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,099
Turns out the media company was partly owned

149
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,120
by Chinese state-linked investors.

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Or this.

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,879
“A scholar at a South African university

152
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,580
was told that he would not receive a visa
to enter China

153
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,880
until his classroom lectures contain more
praise for Beijing.”

154
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
And here’s my own experience.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,099
As I was planning my trip to South Africa,

156
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,759
I tried to set up an interview with a local
expert

157
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,110
on China South Africa relations.

158
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,220
Like I did in Greece, and Italy.

159
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,890
Strangely, I couldn’t find anyone who wanted
to talk to me.

160
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,349
In fact, I was even ghosted a few times.

161
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,280
And then I found out that right after my trip,

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,599
one of the biggest universities in Johannesburg

163
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,330
was hosting a conference on China.

164
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,460
Sponsored by the university’s Confucius
Institute.

165
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,010
Suddenly, many things became clear.

166
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,210
Like I said earlier,

167
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,300
China and South Africa are still in their
honeymoon stage.

168
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,040
We’ll have to keep watching to see what
happens next.

169
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,130
Thanks, Shelley.

170
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,200
So what do you think about China’s growing
ties with South Africa?

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,310
Leave your comments below.

172
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,120
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

173
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,780
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
