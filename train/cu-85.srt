1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,939
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,170
turns out, nuclear weapons might not be

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,460
North Korea’s most dangerous weapon.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,610
Actually, they probably are,

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,480
but this is also concerning.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,970
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,119
So you know how everyone’s been freaking
out

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,869
that North Korea might develop

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,060
and launch a nuclear weapon?

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,759
Well, it turns out

12
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,349
you don’t need to worry about that.

13
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,570
You need to worry that about North Korea

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,150
launching a nuke

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,349
and possibly launching

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,670
global cyber attacks.

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,760
Since you're currently on the internet,

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,100
you've probably heard of the massive cyber
attack

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,180
that began on May 11.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,190
The magnitude of the attack here

21
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,190
is tremendous.

22
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,980
We’re talking 200,000 computers

23
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,870
across 150 different countries

24
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,080
so this is really the biggest cyber shakedown

25
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,280
in history.

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,870
The attack is called WannaCry,

27
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,280
which is how I feel every time

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,600
I look at the news these days.

29
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,970
Around the world,

30
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,140
university, business, and local government
computers

31
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,080
were greeted with this:

32
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Oops!

33
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,070
Your files have been encrypted!

34
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,530
Sorry, it was an honest mistake

35
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,580
the hackers made.

36
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,140
They’ll gladly fix it for you,

37
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,510
if you just pay them $300 in bitcoins.

38
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,600
However if you don’t,

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,710
three days later,

40
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,330
the price gets doubled to $600,

41
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,360
and after seven days,

42
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,200
the files are deleted.

43
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,970
It’s a type of attack called ransomware.

44
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,070
Like software, but with ransom.

45
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,500
I’m sure you understand.

46
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,540
Who’s to blame for this outrage?

47
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,010
Well, it might be North Korea.

48
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,909
Cybersecurity firm Symantec and Kaspersky
Lab

49
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,820
have identified code in a version

50
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,390
of the WannaCry virus

51
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,250
that is linked to the Lazarus Group.

52
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,479
That's the same group that was behind

53
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,640
the Sony Pictures hack in 2014.

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,340
They're also known for stealing 81 million
dollars

55
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,320
from Bangladesh's central bank.

56
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,430
And they work for North Korea.

57
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,760
That isn't enough to say this attack

58
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,170
was definitely done by North Korea.

59
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,170
For example,

60
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,159
some experts say this ransomware attack

61
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,890
isn't how North Korean hackers

62
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,830
usually operate.

63
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,580
Or that it's possible that other hackers

64
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,619
just borrowed the code from Lazarus.

65
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,619
Which makes the dark web

66
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,370
sound like the kind of friendly neighborhood

67
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,739
where your next-door hacker can ring your
computer

68
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,689
and ask to borrow a cup of code.

69
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:20,689
The point is,

70
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,799
we don't know for certain that North Korea

71
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,879
is behind WannaCry.

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,499
But one good thing that's come out of this

73
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:29,230
is now people are paying way more attention

74
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,669
to the danger of North Korean cyber attacks,

75
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,159
thanks to the sudden media focus.

76
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,379
Unless you're talking about the focus

77
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,359
of Chinese state-run media.

78
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,090
Which are blaming another country f

79
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,150
or the cyber attacks.

80
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,520
Guess which one?

81
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,980
China Daily says,

82
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,379
“the US National Security Agency

83
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,480
must shoulder some of the blame.”

84
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh great,

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,349
it involves the NSA.

86
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,340
That's so embarrassing.

87
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,639
My favorite state-run media,

88
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,879
the Global Times, said,

89
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,819
“Many criticized the U.S. government,

90
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,260
saying that it was responsible

91
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,310
for this spread of ransomware.

92
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,860
Obviously this accusation is reasonable.”

93
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,060
Obviously.

94
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
Just as reasonable as the People’s Daily

95
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,480
comparing it to the hacking scene in Die Hard 4.

96
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,359
Yes, they did.

97
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:21,919
How, you ask,

98
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,620
is the NSA responsible

99
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,629
for this cyber attack?

100
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,239
Apparently, the NSA has been exploiting

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,120
a flaw in Microsoft Windows for years,

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
with a hacking tool known as EternalBlue,

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,499
which is also how I feel every time

104
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:36,840
I look at the news.

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,319
Apparently, a hacking group called The Shadow
Brokers

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,659
got their hands on it

107
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,900
and made it public last month.

108
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,159
And that’s how the alleged North Korean
hackers

109
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,359
were able to pull this off.

110
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,359
Allegedly.

111
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,620
So, the NSA messed up.

112
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,109
But that’s not the whole story.

113
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,409
Let's back up for a moment

114
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,040
and talk about North Korean hackers.

115
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,569
The reason that hackers like the Lazarus Group

116
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,430
are able to pull off massive cyber attacks

117
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,659
is thanks to decades of training,

118
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,659
Internet access,

119
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,879
and office space

120
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,159
that was given to North Korea by—

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,739
you guessed it—

122
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:12,790
China.

123
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,829
Oops.

124
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,979
Yes, according to North Korean defectors,

125
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,660
China is largely responsible

126
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,750
for the growth of North Korea’s

127
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,950
cyber espionage abilities.

128
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,780
And they learned well.

129
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,060
According to the Korea Institute of Liberal
Democracy

130
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,069
in Seoul,

131
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,889
“Today, an elite squad of 6,800 North Korean
state hackers

132
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,940
are engaged in fraud, blackmail

133
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,000
and online gambling that together

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,810
generate annual revenue of $860 million.”

135
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,250
It’s the only way the poor,

136
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,789
starving leaders of North Korea

137
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,050
can fund themselves

138
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,810
with those mean old sanctions

139
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,510
the UN put on them.

140
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,680
That, plus gunrunning,

141
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,879
jewel smuggling, illegal gambling,

142
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,610
counterfeiting, and dealing drugs

143
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,060
out of its embassies worldwide.

144
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,090
And again, North Korea’s hacking skills

145
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,840
are thanks largely to decades of support

146
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,270
from the Chinese Communist Party.

147
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,479
So it’s ironic that the country

148
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,430
hardest hit by WannaCry—

149
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,979
which, even if not done by North Korea,

150
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,330
definitely used North Korean code—

151
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,500
was China!

152
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,870
I bet he does wanna cry.

153
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,870
The Global Times says

154
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,180
“about 40,000 [Chinese] institutions

155
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,430
have been affected;

156
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,930
of those, 4,000 were academic,

157
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,330
including Tsinghua University

158
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,340
and Peking University.”

159
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
So if the Chinese regime

160
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,110
gave so much support and training

161
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,259
to North Korean hackers in the past,

162
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,729
why would North Korea want to cyber attack

163
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,380
the hand that feeds it?

164
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,819
Isn’t that sort of evidence

165
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,340
it might not be North Korea

166
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,759
behind the attack?

167
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,680
Well, not necessarily.

168
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,689
Relations between China and North Korea

169
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,080
are increasingly bitter.

170
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Former Chinese leader

171
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,639
and Super Ghouls and Ghosts wannabe, Jiang
Zemin

172
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,190
was awkwardly close

173
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,130
with Kim Jong-Un’s daddy,

174
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,460
but current leaders Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-Un

175
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,080
are not even friends.

176
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,039
They haven’t even had a state visit.

177
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,990
And now Xi Jinping is apparently working

178
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,740
with President Trump,

179
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,919
so I wouldn’t be surprised if Kim

180
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,509
is a bit jealous.

181
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,509
But there could be

182
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,129
other explanations, too:

183
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,430
It could have been a cyber attack

184
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,849
that unexpectedly hit computers in China

185
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,250
in a way that North Korea didn’t intend.

186
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,889
Or it could possibly have not been

187
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,560
North Korea at all.

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,639
Either way,

189
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,960
it probably wasn’t a good long-term strategy
