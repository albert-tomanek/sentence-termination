00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:04,799
Chinese Media Threatens Missile Strikes on
Australia

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,519
China targets climate activist Grerta Thunberg

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,050
And the US describes China using the G-word.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,310
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,320
This episode is sponsored by Daily Pnut.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,050
The news can be a tough pill to swallow.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:35,920
That's why Daily Pnut gives you a daily dose
of news in equal parts humor and substance.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,899
Speaking of entertaining and substantial news...

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,219
Tensions between China and Australia are at
an all time high.

11
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,149
The Chinese Communist Party launched a trade
war with Australia a year ago, after Prime

12
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,999
Minister Scott Morrison called for an investigation
into the origin of the coronavirus.

13
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:56,870
Why would the world need an investigation
anyway?

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,499
Everyone knows the coronavirus didn’t come
from China.

15
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:04,360
It’s clear that the virus came from the
US army...

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,380
Making frozen food…

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,400
Out of auto parts packaging.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,460
See?

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,569
Case closed.

20
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:16,060
But a year after Australia’s call for an
investigation, the Chinese Communist Party

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
has still refused.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,810
And they’re still mad about it.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,909
This week, my favorite Chinese state-run newspaper,
the Global Times said China should be ready

24
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,520
to launch a devastating missile strike on
Australia.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
In this op-ed,

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,149
Global Times Chief Editor Hu Xijin writes,
China should be ready to make “long-range

27
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:42,240
strikes on the military facilities and relevant
key facilities on Australian soil.”

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,950
That could happen, should Australia do anything
foolish like send troops to defend Taiwan

29
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,799
from a Chinese invasion.

30
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,150
Last month, a top Australian security official
warned of China beating the drums of war.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,649
He didn’t specifically say China, but it
was clear enough.

32
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,420
Which is ridiculous.

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,619
As the Global Times says, “China loves peace.”

34
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,960
Especially the pieces of Australia left after
a Chinese missile strike!

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,610
China also just suspended its economic dialogue
with Australia.

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,570
But keep in mind, you can’t think of Hu
Xijinas some rogue newspaper editor.

37
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,820
Among Chinese state-run media, the Global
Times is the most hawkish, over-the-top mouthpiece

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,420
of the Chinese Communist Party.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,920
But it’s still a mouthpiece.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,830
This is part of the Party’s year-long attempt
to terrorize Australia into submission.

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,770
Make it seem like a fight would be so bloody,
there’s no point in even having the fight.

42
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,150
The truth is, when you stand up to a bully,
they tend to back down pretty quick.

43
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,860
But the Global Times is on a roll this week.

44
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,040
They’re also targeting Greta Thunberg.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,000
You see, according to this new report from
the Rhodium Group, China produces more greenhouse

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,950
gases than the rest of the developed world
combined.

47
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,220
And climate activist Greta Thunberg finally
had some harsh words for China.

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,810
She said China is “ruining future and present
living conditions.”

49
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,730
Enter the Global Times to say Thunberg isn’t
knowledgeable enough to understand climate

50
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,730
change.

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,590
She’s also a puppet of Western politicians.

52
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:33,430
It also describes her as “the Swedish teenager
who skipped school for so-called climate protests”.

53
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,430
This is not the first time Thunberg has run
afoul of the Global Times.

54
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,000
Last year it was for her support of Hong Kong
protesters.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,570
The Global Times said she was “ignorant”

56
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,750
“Despicable”

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,170
and “nothing but a clown.”

58
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,640
I wonder why powerful men are so scared of
Grerta Thunberg?

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,160
Wait, I get it.

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
I’m scared of her, too.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,620
And after the break, Chinese state-run media
makes up lies all the time—but this one’s

62
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,150
hilarious.

63
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,150
Welcome back.

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,290
It’s not just the Global Times that had
a week of winning it.

65
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,650
State-run China Daily posted this video to
Twitter to promote China tourism.

66
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,270
Wow, beautiful.

67
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,220
Except the video is not from China.

68
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,510
It’s from the Swiss Alps.

69
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,260
And you might think, ok so they misidentified
the country.

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,410
People make mistakes.

71
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,520
But it gets worse.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,290
“The Chinese communist propaganda version
of the video was slightly edited, including

73
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:38,100
flipping the image horizontally, making colour
corrections, and seemingly doctoring a stick

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,610
into the dog’s mouth.”

75
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,180
Wow, they did a good job with the stick.

76
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,900
(
Not a good job with the propaganda.

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,930
And state-run Xinhua has registered as a foreign
agent in the US.

78
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,310
It only took less than three years for them
to get around to it.

79
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,210
They had been ordered to back in 2018.

80
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,910
Xinhua joins two other Chinese state-run media—CGTN
and China Daily—as being registered foreign

81
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,280
agents.

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,930
That means they’re required to disclose
their annual budget and expenditures to the

83
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,930
US government.

84
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,220
Let’s hope that Xinhua’s budget disclosures
are more accurate than China’s other statistics.

85
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,510
The National Bureau of Statistics finally
released their 10-year census data.

86
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,730
Earlier Western media reports said that China’s
population fell for the first time in 50 years.

87
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,020
But now, after weeks of delay, the official
statistics show that China’s population

88
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,680
actually rose.

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,300
Imagine that.

90
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,150
Some China analysts have noticed something...funny...about
China’s latest statistics.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,460
A sudden unusual bump in the population growth
rate in 2020.

92
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,700
All of this is to push back against the idea
that China is facing a demographic crisis,

93
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
which it is.

94
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,520
I talked about that crisis in an episode last
week.

95
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,780
More developments in the South China Sea.

96
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,660
The Philippines has flagged nearly 300 incursions
by Chinese militia boats.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,430
The government of the Philippines says it
has logged what it calls "illegal incursions"

98
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,010
into its waters by 287 boats with Chinese
militia aboard.

99
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,480
The country's task force on the South China
sea said in a statement that the incident

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,169
may prompt possible diplomatic actions.

101
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,240
Yes, diplomatic action like...being reluctant
to confront China.

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,430
Meanwhile, Taiwan is denouncing China’s
shameless lies.

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,440
Specifically about refusing Taiwan access
to the World Health Organization.

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,100
China prevents Taiwan from having access to
the WHO, because, as China’s foreign ministry

105
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,630
said, “Nobody cared more for Taiwan’s
people than the Chinese government.”

106
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,949
Taiwan’s Foreing Minister Joseph Wu responded
by saying “After what Beijing has done to

107
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:03,540
Xinjiang, Tibet & Hong Kong, no sane person
would believe it could take care of Taiwan’s

108
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,690
health needs or otherwise.

109
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,840
Thank God we aren’t under China’s control!

110
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,090
Please help us keep it at a distance.”

111
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,330
Now that’s one form of social distancing
I can get behind!

112
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,370
That and social distancing because of my crippling
anxiety around people in general.

113
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,560
And US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has
decided to make the Chinese Communist Party

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,900
very unhappy this week.

115
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,610
He said, “There is no reasonable justification
for Taiwan’s continued exclusion from [The

116
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,410
World Health Organization].”

117
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,949
And he demanded the WHO allow Taiwan to attend
an upcoming WHO meeting, the World Health

118
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,270
Assembly.

119
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,830
You know, being that Taiwan is part of the
world.

120
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,650
But Blinken didn’t stop there.

121
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,290
He also announced the State Department is
sanctioning a Chinese official involved in

122
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,240
the persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual
group.

123
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,580
China broadly criminalizes religious expression
and continues to commit crimes against humanity

124
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,740
and genocide against Muslim Uyghurs and members
of other religious and ethnic minority groups.

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,900
Today, I’m announcing the designation of
Yu Hui, former office director of the so-called

126
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,470
Central Leading Group Preventing and Dealing
with Heretical Religions, of Chengdu, for

127
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,560
his involvement in gross violations of human
rights, namely, the arbitrary detention of

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,510
Falun Gong practitioners.

129
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,759
Blinken made the announcement as part of the
release of the State Department’s 2020 International

130
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,309
Religious Freedom Report.

131
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,809
And Blinken also specifically used the word
“genocide” to talk about the persecution

132
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,579
of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

133
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:50,759
It shouldn’t actually be a big deal to use
the word genocide to describe China’s genocide—which

134
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,139
meets every definition of genocide under the
UN Convention on Genocide.

135
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:02,759
But sadly, the US is still one of the few
countries to officially use the G-word.

136
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,699
So props to Blinken for having the B-word.

137
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,439
And after the break, Hong Kong is going after
journalists.

138
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,329
With a bat!

139
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,000
Welcome back.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,319
Nearly a year ago, Beijing passed the Hong
Kong National Security Law.

141
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:25,470
It aims to take away as much freedom of speech
and press as possible, while still pretending

142
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,749
that Hong Kong has its own autonomous government.

143
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:34,540
But when laws aren’t enough to stop the
free press, sometimes a more direct approach

144
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,949
is needed.

145
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,220
This is The Epoch Times.

146
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,220
It’s one of the last independent Chinese-language
media in Hong Kong.

147
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,689
Last week, a Hong Kong reporter for the The
Epoch Times was attacked by a man with a bat.

148
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:53,490
“The assailant hit her with the bat more
than 10 times before fleeing in a car.”

149
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,040
Takes a big man to beat a defenseless woman
with a bat.

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,130
The Epoch Times is a newspaper critical of
the Chinese Communist Party.

151
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,351
Last month, its Hong Kong printing press was
attacked by men with sledge hammers.

152
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:12,269
And the US State Department, along with other
US lawmakers, have condemned the assault.

153
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:18,279
Meanwhile, Hong Kong chief Executive Carrie
Lam is pushing for laws to stop so-called

154
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,259
“fake news.”

155
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:26,550
Those will likely be aimed at stopping pro-democracy
media like the Epoch Times and Apple Daily

156
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,529
from criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.

157
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,690
On Monday, we’ll have a longer episode about
Hong Kong’s crackdown on the media.

158
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,100
And also we’ll have the Epoch Times reporter
who was attacked join us on our weekly podcast,

159
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
China Unscripted.

160
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,750
Yes, we also do a podcast every week.

161
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,259
In more Hong Kong news, Hong Kong legislators
have officially passed a patriotic oath law.

162
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:56,309
Certain high level lawmakers and public servants
have to swear an oath of loyalty to China—and

163
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,139
now the law adds district councillors to that
list.

164
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,190
But that’s not all.

165
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,910
The law also includes ways that people could
be disqualified for breaching their oath.

166
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:14,779
“Including by refusing to recognise China's
sovereignty over Hong Kong, supporting independence,

167
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,340
seeking foreign interference, ‘insulting’
a flag, as well as ‘endangering national

168
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,819
security.’”

169
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,930
Insulting a flag, huh?

170
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,490
Hey flag.

171
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,660
You look funny.

172
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,810
Well, guess I’m never going to be a Hong
Kong local district councillor.

173
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,360
The Biden Administration is reversing a Trump
era blacklist of Chinese phone company Xiaomi.

174
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,259
The Trump Administration had put it on a trade
black list because of links between Xiaomi

175
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,449
and the Chinese military.

176
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,620
Seven other Chinese companies were put on
the same blacklist.

177
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,800
But Xiaomi sued, and won in a US court.

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,809
“Soon after the victory, Reuters reported
that other Chinese companies placed on the

179
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,290
same blacklist were considering similar lawsuits.”

180
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,739
A fantastic development.

181
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:10,360
See, by law, all Chinese companies have to
work with the Chinese military.

182
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,949
They call it civil military fusion.

183
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:18,990
And now, Chinese military-linked companies
like Xiaomi will be able to sell their hardware

184
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,689
devices in the US again—to unsuspecting
consumers.

185
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,860
