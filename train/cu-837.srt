1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
Beef!

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
It’s what’s for dinner.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,240
If you’re the US president visiting Asia.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,669
China builds a magical island maker.

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:12,230
No, seriously that’s what they’re calling
it.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,280
And finally,

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,690
you might want to stand for the Chinese national
anthem.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,460
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,440
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,910
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,910
In our top story,

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,500
Japan and China go to war...

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,180
over who can serve the better meal

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,190
to visiting US President Donald Trump!

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,050
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,960
will be tough to be beat.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,359
While the two played golf,

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,769
he served the president a $10,

20
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:45,379
100% American Angus beef patty hamburger

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,819
from a local Tokyo burger joint.

22
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:49,480
Afterwards, the burger joint

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,140
that made the President’s Colby Jack Cheeseburger

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,140
sold out

25
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
as the people of Japan

26
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,339
flocked to try the presidential meal.

27
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,010
But Trump is now in China,

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,429
and Xi Jinping knows just what President Trump

29
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,350
hungers for above all else:

30
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,030
one-upping Obama.

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,689
Donald Trump has become the first US president
ever,

32
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,340
since the founding of the People’s Republic
of China,

33
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,870
to dine in the Forbidden City.

34
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,530
Actually, the first foreign official ever.

35
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,780
For 500 years,

36
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,149
the Forbidden City was the palace of China’s
emperors.

37
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,340
Hmm, actually,

38
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,550
I wonder if this decision has more to do with

39
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,650
Xi Jinping comparing himself to China’s
emperors

40
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,500
than anything else.

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,859
President Trump has congratulated Xi Jinping

42
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:36,280
on become the most powerful Chinese leader

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,149
since Mao Zedong.

44
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,070
Which is a weird compliment if you think about
it.

45
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,180
I don’t think Angela Merkel would like it

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,130
if you congratulated her on being

47
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,700
the most powerful German leader

48
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,359
since Hitler.

49
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,460
But there was one important question on everyone’s
mind

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,719
when Trump landed in China.

51
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,810
With the world’s most sophisticated and
oppressive censorship

52
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,090
over the Internet and social media,

53
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,880
how was Trump gonna Tweet?!

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,470
Well, we didn’t need to worry.

55
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,390
Even though Twitter is banned in China,

56
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,650
a White House official told reporters,

57
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,259
“The president will tweet whatever he wants.

58
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,720
That’s his way of communicating

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,140
directly with the American people.”

60
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,010
I have never been more proud of Trump’s
tweets.

61
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,360
We’ll have a more in-depth look at

62
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,550
President Trump’s visit

63
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,980
in next week’s full episode.

64
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
In other news,

65
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
outspoken social commentator Katy Perry,

66
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,060
who apparently also sings or something,

67
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,549
has made no secret of her angry feelings

68
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,670
about President Trump.

69
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,740
But when it comes to China,

70
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,970
a country where leaders

71
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,530
routinely kill their own citizens,

72
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,019
she might not be so outspoken.

73
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,860
China Digital Times uncovered this letter

74
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,840
floating around on Weibo,

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,970
allegedly from Katy Perry.

76
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,209
It says she promises to

77
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,150
"observe the laws and regulations in China,

78
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,480
comply with the management of the regulators,"

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,959
and not to "add or change any content without
authorization,"

80
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,030
"do or say anything religious or political,"

81
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,340
or "participate in any activities that jeopardize

82
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,530
China’s unity and integrity."

83
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,860
So I don’t think she’ll pull a Bjork

84
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,599
and start shouting “Tibet” during a concert.

85
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,819
Also, Bjork was talented.

86
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,379
Ok Katy Perry jokes aside,

87
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,849
this is an eye-opening look

88
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,970
at how the Communist Party extends its censorship

89
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,260
across the entertainment world.

90
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
After all,

91
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,630
Katy Perry is definitely not the only artist

92
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,340
who’s been asked to sign a letter like this.

93
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,510
Unless the CCP was especially disturbed

94
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,370
by the subversiveness of Left Shark.

95
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,120
Meanwhile, three US college basketball players
from UCLA

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
were detained by police in Shanghai,

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
for allegedly stealing from a Louis Vuitton
store.

98
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,189
Unfortunately for them

99
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,390
the store was a knockoff.

100
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,319
What is not a knockoff, however,

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,230
is China’s new magical island maker.

102
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,580
That’s what they’re calling

103
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,930
the latest Chinese dredging vessel…

104
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,370
...that can dig up 6,000 cubic meters an hour
of the ocean floor

105
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,190
and churn out brand new islands for the Chinese
regime.

106
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,230
Just like the brand new islands the Chinese
regime

107
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,239
already built in the South China Sea.

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,670
And they’re probably never going to stop,

109
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,439
even though they maybe ought to.

110
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,000
The way Steven Tyler is probably never going
to stop

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,670
coming out with new albums,

112
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,910
even though maybe he ought to.

113
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,299
And while the CCP is building artificial islands

114
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,380
in the middle of the ocean,

115
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,620
they’re also building artificial support
for themselves

116
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,280
in Hong Kong.

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,630
Just a bit of background,

118
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,910
in Mainland China,

119
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,350
a new law has now upped the jail time

120
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,740
for disrespecting the national anthem—

121
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,160
from 15 days, to 3 years.

122
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,860
It’s those kinds of laws

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,410
that Hong Kong was supposed to be exempt from

124
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,440
under the One Country, Two Systems policy.

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,630
Which is why Hong Kongers

126
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,560
have been very disrespectful of the anthem.

127
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,310
Well, “the People’s Congress passed a
decision

128
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,390
demanding Hong Kong adopt the National Anthem
Law.”

129
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,180
That is being met with intense protest.

130
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,460
Except for in the totally still independent
Hong Kong government.

131
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,139
According to one Hong Kong official,

132
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,820
“Hong Kong will try to enact a law

133
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,880
penalizing people who boo the Chinese national
anthem

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,110
‘as soon as possible.’”

135
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,030
No decision has been made about jail time
yet.

136
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,430
Speaking of jail time—

137
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,500
and Hong Kong’s eroding freedoms—

138
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,289
Umbrella Movement leaders Joshua Wong and
Nathan Law

139
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,840
have been given a chance to appeal their prison
terms.

140
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
You know,

141
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,460
the ones the courts re-sentenced

142
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,150
after judges decided their original sentences

143
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,889
of community service that they’d already
served

144
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,039
weren’t harsh enough.

145
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,680
And also after Nathan Law had become an elected
official,

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,889
but then was kicked out,

147
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,290
for reasons totally unrelated to the fact

148
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,220
that he’s critical of the Chinese Communist
Party.

149
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,080
What do you think? Leave your comments below.

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,200

154
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,729
to get a great all-American hamburger,

155
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,940
but you only need to go to ChinaUncensored.tv
