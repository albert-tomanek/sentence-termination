00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,919
is Australia being infiltrated

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,900
at all levels of society and government

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,230
by a highly organized network of Chinese spies?

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,780
Or is Australia just being racist?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,180
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,280
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:20,750
Something’s rotten in the state of Australia.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,980
And I’m not talking about Vegemite.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,780
I’m talking about racism.

11
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,320
The Chinese Embassy has accused

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,199
the Australian media and government of having,

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,970
“a Cold War mentality,”

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,410
“racial prejudice,”

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,140
and “anti-China hysteria and paranoia.”

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,140
Why?

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,440
Well, let’s listen to this report

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
from Australian media in June.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,180
“A joint investigation by a team of journalists

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,480
from Four Corners and Fairfax Media

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,360
has exposed a concerted campaign

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,870
by the Chinese government and its proxies

23
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,629
to infiltrate the Australian political process

24
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:55,560
to promote its own interests.”

25
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,840
I’m not seeing any racism here so far.

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,360
Okay, but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,470
just announced new laws targeting Chinese
Australians.

28
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,030
And it’s got China’s Foreign Ministry
seething.

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,810
“We were shocked at what Turnbull had said.

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,630
Such comments pander to certain

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,040
irresponsible reports in Australian media,

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
they are full of prejudice against China.”

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,280
Yeah, just listen to what Turnbull said

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,470
at the beginning of the month.

35
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,460
“I want to be very clear,

36
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,050
we have focused on the activities

37
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,530
of foreign states and their agents in Australia,

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,060
and not the loyalties of Australians

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,940
who happen to be from another country.”

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,260
Wait, so he’s specifically stating

41
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,370
that the issue is not about questioning

42
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,860
the loyalties of Chinese Australians.

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,600
I’m not seeing the racism there, either.

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,660
Could the Chinese Communist Party be,

45
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,070
I don’t know,

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,960
using racism to distract everyone

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,470
from the actual facts?

48
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,820
But would they really do such a thing?

49
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
After all,

50
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
China’s state-run People’s Daily

51
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,670
said that the Australian government should

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,360
“uphold the principle of truth from facts.”

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,250
Well, let’s take a look at the facts.

54
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,860
This December marks 45 years

55
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,479
of bilateral relations between

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,550
the People’s Republic of China and Australia.

57
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,830
According to the New York Times,

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,959
“China has long treated Australia

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,129
as a laboratory for soft power experiments,

60
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,049
flexing its economic muscle,

61
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,409
sending students to study at its universities

62
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,870
and creating organizations with close ties

63
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,960
to the Communist Party.”

64
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,140
That was also the gist of the Fairfax Media

65
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,870
and Four Corners reports earlier this year.

66
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,450
However, what China failed to realize

67
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,970
is that by sending its citizens to study in
Australia,

68
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,340
they’d end up with—

69
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,019
let’s be honest here—

70
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,500
the most confusing English accent.

71
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
I mean, “Chocco”?

72
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,920
“Bickie”?

73
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,640
“Macca’s”?

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,720
I rest my case.

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Anyway, in response to media reports exposing

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,689
the CCP’s attempts to influence Australia,

77
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,849
the Turnbull government is proposing laws

78
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,200
banning foreign campaign donations,

79
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,389
and requiring transparent registration of
foreign agents.

80
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,120
The laws are actually modeled after

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,650
similar laws in the United States.

82
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,650
They make it illegal

83
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,819
to support foreign intelligence agencies,

84
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,819
leak information,

85
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,420
and steal trade secrets,

86
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,799
with offenders facing 15-20 years in prison.

87
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,650
Notice that none of that specifically targets
China.

88
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,909
It’s just that,

89
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,239
considering which foreign powers

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,079
are actively trying to infiltrate Australia,

91
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,790
China will be most affected by the new laws.

92
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,040
Take a specific case for example:

93
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,150
Australian Parliament Member Sam Dastyari
—

94
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,049
whose face answers the question

95
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,609
“What if Mr. Bean ate too many Tim Tams,

96
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:41,639
ran for office,

97
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,940
then resigned in disgrace?”

98
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,840
Media are now calling Sam Dastyari

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
“Shanghai Sam”—

100
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,499
but there’s nothing funny about that.

101
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:51,629
Because the media reports I just mentioned

102
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,769
uncovered thousands of dollars worth of

103
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,529
campaign contributions made to Dastyari

104
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,739
by Huang Xiangmo,

105
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,489
a Chinese billionaire with questionable ties

106
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,469
to the Chinese regime.

107
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,940
Now while that all was very sketchy,

108
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,209
under Australia’s old campaign contribution
laws,

109
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,040
“sketchy” was perfectly legal.

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,529
In fact, Huang Xiangmo gave

111
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,919
almost 2.7 million dollars

112
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,590
to the three biggest Australian political
parties

113
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,180
over the course of four years.

114
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,210
At least a million of that was raised

115
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,570
by Dastyari for his Australian Labor Party.

116
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,980
But earlier this month,

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
it came out that

118
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,910
Huang Xiangmo and Dastyari’s relationship

119
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,930
went deeper than anyone expected.

120
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,210
At a press conference with Chinese media in
2016,

121
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,160
Dastyari contradicted his own party’s stance

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,510
on the South China Sea.

123
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,350
No one knew exactly what he said,

124
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,110
just that Chinese media started reporting

125
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,850
that he was saying Australia

126
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,690
should butt out of the South China Sea conflict—

127
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,320
which was the opposite of what the Labor Party

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,410
had just said the day before.

129
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,300
The Labor Party was saying the Chinese regime

130
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,270
should abide by a recent ruling by the Hague

131
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,570
rejecting China’s claim to a big portion

132
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,730
of the South China Sea.

133
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,820
After some controversy,

134
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,810
Dastyari said he took “a foreign policy
question

135
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,130
he shouldn't have taken,

136
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,050
mumbled it and answered it incorrectly."

137
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,240
But you know, he only mumbled some answer,

138
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,450
that’s not really all that bad, right?

139
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,920
It’s just in keeping with his Mr. Bean persona.

140
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,420
And so he began to build up his career again.

141
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,560
Except a recording of that conference just
came out.

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
And it sure doesn’t sound like mumbling.

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,590
“The Chinese integrity of its borders

144
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,770
is a matter for China,

145
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,770
and the role that Australia

146
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,730
should be playing as a friend is to know,

147
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,870
that with the several thousand years of history,

148
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,090
thousands of years of history,

149
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,520
where it is and isn’t our place to be involved.”

150
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,550
You know, thousands of years of history!

151
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,600
China’s borders are China’s business!

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,390
Australia should just butt out.

153
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,260
Why, that sounds just like

154
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,820
the official Communist Party line!

155
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,330
And we now know that a few weeks

156
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,410
after Dastyari “mumbled” that response,

157
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,270
he also kind of accidentally stumbled his
way

158
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,250
to Huang Xiangmo’s mansion and alerted him
that

159
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,440
“his phone was probably being tapped

160
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
by security agencies.”

161
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,160
As in, “Hey the Australian authorities are
watching you.

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,980
You might want to use a burner phone

163
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,040
for all your illegal activities.

164
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Just saying.

165
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
As a friend.”

166
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
What a lovable klutz.

167
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,190
Just like Mr. Bean.

168
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,210
Dastyari is also accused of trying to

169
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,490
pressure another member of his own party

170
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,680
to cancel a meeting with a pro-democracy activist

171
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
while she was in Hong Kong.

172
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,940
And now that all this has come out

173
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,370
and there are calls for Dastyari

174
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,080
to resign from Parliament,

175
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,470
he is once again parroting

176
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,450
the Communist Party line.

177
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,830
But this time, about racism.

178
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,590
“I expect Turnbull and the Liberals to smear
me,

179
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,500
but for he and his colleagues to suggest

180
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,250
that I am not a true or loyal Australian

181
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,100
is incredibly hurtful—

182
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,280
and hurtful to all overseas-born Australians.”

183
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,670
Dastyari is referring to the fact

184
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,470
that he was born in Iran,

185
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,440
which is definitely relevant to the fact

186
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,300
that he’s accused of selling out to China.

187
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,110
But anyway, Shanghai Sam is resigning now,

188
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,240
saying he won’t return to parliament in
2018.

189
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,340
Unfortunately, he isn’t one of a kind.

190
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,390
Australia’s security agency ASIO

191
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,950
just “identified 10 state and local political
candidates

192
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,190
linked to Chinese intelligence agencies.”

193
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,590
ASIO didn’t name names,

194
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,810
but did indicate that at least one of the
people

195
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,050
was elected and is still in office.

196
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,300
He or she is probably getting their

197
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,370
“I was just mumbling” defense ready.

198
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,750
Anyway, Australia is like the canary in the
coal mine.

199
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,100
Other countries need to take a look

200
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,850
at what’s happening because it’s not just
Australia.

201
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,870
In the coming months,

202
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,340
there will be a lot more coming out

203
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,820
about the Chinese Communist Party’s

204
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,780
attempts to influence Western countries.

205
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,020
And it seems the US is taking notice.

206
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,320
But there’s something that Western media

207
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,850
and governments should be careful about.

208
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,370
After these stories broke in the Australian
media,

209
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,850
there have been legitimate instances of racism

210
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,410
and harassment of Chinese people in Australia.

211
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,720
And that’s a shame.

212
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,940
Not just because racism is bad.

213
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,200
Which it is.

214
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,070
But expressing prejudice against 1.2 million

215
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,480
Chinese Australians also plays

216
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,190
right into the Chinese Communist Party’s
hands.

217
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,800
Let’s not forget that the first victims
of the CCP’s

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,270
infiltration into foreign countries

219
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,610
are the Chinese people living in those countries.

220
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,879
They are the first ones to be infiltrated
and influenced,

221
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,590
not to mention silenced, by the Party.

222
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,909
The CCP’s United Front Work Department

223
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,740
has a special division dedicated to targeting

224
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,250
overseas Chinese to, uh,

225
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,500
“maintain” their loyalty.

226
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,439
And then when the CCP’s actions

227
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:54,910
cause a backlash toward normal Chinese Australians,

228
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,310
the Chinese regime changes tactics,

229
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,459
trying to act like it’s the defender of
overseas Chinese,

230
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,920
heroically protecting them

231
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,620
from a racist Australian government and media.

232
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
In this case,

233
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,370
I think the Australian government and media

234
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,850
have been for the most part very careful

235
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,880
to not be racist against Chinese Australians.

236
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,860
Sure, that hasn’t stopped the CCP

237
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,560
from making their accusations.

238
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,009
But, like the People’s Daily said,

239
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,639
we can all judge the “truth from facts.”

240
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,279
So what do you think about Australia’s

241
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,190
new foreign interference laws?

242
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,000
And what do you think about the Chinese regime’s

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,430
claims of racism?
