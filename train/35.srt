00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,491
...from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,080
Every fact they get p-- pfh-- pfft... damn it!

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Ohhhh!

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,180
It just started to get away from me.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,240
I've also just gozzed all over my screen.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
- Gozzed?
- Gozzed!

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,620
I'm from Nottinghamshire!

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,180
And 1995.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,640
In front of me I've got an article fromf--

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
Aaaa-hahaha!

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
- W****r. 
- Take a breather.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,590
Have a sip of water.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,080
- And when you're ready...
- Then you'll be ready to start.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Okay?

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
- Right.
- You've got this one.

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
Sorry.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,840
In front of me...

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,760
- We'll behave.
- I just thought...

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,960
WILL YOU STOP IT!

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,360
Do you know, we've done that so many times,

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,350
and it's much funnier when there's an audience.

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,500
Usually it's just us three laughing at him.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,510
In a kitchen.

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,520
Now you can all join in too.

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,940
Okay, we'll behave.

26
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,020
Badly.

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,739
Consistently badly.

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,360
We've got to be out on time for this one.

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,039
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it...
