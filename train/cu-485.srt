00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,939
could Xi Jinping’s big campaign

3
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,859
wreck China’s economy?

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,700
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,760
We’ve all been there.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,280
Maybe it’s the Secret Santa exchange at
your office holiday party.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,040
Or the extended family Christmas celebration.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,520
That awkward moment when someone gives you

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,430
a gift you just don’t know what to do with.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,760
“Thanks Aunt Marge!

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,110
A picture of the Last Supper with cat heads,

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,110
that you painted yourself!

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,309
You shouldn’t have…”

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,429
And it’s an even bigger deal in modern China,

16
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:42,069
a place with a rich tradition of less handmade
gift giving.

17
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,749
For example,

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,780
business leaders love to give their local
officials

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,860
something to mark the Lunar New Year,

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,370
like,

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,280
oh I don’t know,

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,900
say,

23
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,900
solid gold mooncakes.

24
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:55,219
Which are only slightly less edible than the
traditional kind.

25
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,309
But gosh darn it,

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,219
you’re a hard working official.

27
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,690
And there’s a pile of solid gold mooncakes,

28
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,399
just sitting in your office, collecting dust.

29
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,570
What are you going to do with those?

30
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,570
Re-gifting?

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,430
Nope,

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,820
There's something even better.

33
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,140
You can just sell these pesky gifts for cash!

34
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,060
Stores have cropped up around China

35
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,170
catering specially to officials looking to
unload bribes,

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,409
er, I mean gifts,

37
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,840
for some nice spendable yuan.

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,259
And then the stores turn around and resell
those bribes,

39
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,649
I mean, gifts,

40
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,820
to business leaders looking to impress

41
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,329
other hardworking government officials.

42
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:32,829
Yes,

43
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,180
These intrepid Chinese entrepreneurs have

44
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,089
come up with a gift recycling industry.

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,840
In fact,

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,939
it’s a 115 billion-dollar-a-year business.

47
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,939
That’s according to

48
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,789
- and I’m not making this up -

49
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,229
China’s Gift Industry Research Institute,

50
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,399
which tracks gift purchases throughout the
country.

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,940
Because yes,

52
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,140
in China there’s a government organ

53
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,360
for literally every aspect of your private
life.

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,899
This has been going on since at least 2001,

55
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,359
when state-run Xinhua first published an article
about it.

56
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,789
In 2014,

57
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,660
CCTV made a half hour special about the industry.

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,970
In Hangzhou alone,

59
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,950
there were over one hundred gift-buying shops,

60
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,320
usually located near government buildings.

61
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,390
I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.

62
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,750
But if you’re looking forward to selling
off

63
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,480
a few of your own extravagences while in Hangzhou

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
for the G20,

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,850
you might be in for disappointment.

66
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,390
Because this robust industry is dying,

67
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,570
Another victim of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s
anti-corruption campaign.

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,260
Since Xi came into power in 2012,

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,340
officials have been under close scrutiny.

70
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,480
Last year alone,

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,740
Xi’s campaign took down 300,000 officials.

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,640
Corruption is kind of a problem in China.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,740
According to research publication YaleGlobal,

74
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,540
80% of government officials there are corrupt.

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,320
In a Charney Research survey

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,490
of more than 2,000 Chinese companies,

77
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,600
35% said they pay bribes or give these kind
of gifts

78
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,890
in order to operate.

79
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,930
It’s “an unspoken rule” according to
one CFO.

80
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,930
But I mean,

81
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,230
what’s the problem with a few billion dollars

82
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,430
in gifts between friends, right?

83
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,300
Well,

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,740
according to Switzerland’s Crema Research,

85
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,640
it just means less money for minor things.

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,870
Like education.

87
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,130
And public health.

88
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,000
One study estimated that corruption actually
costs China

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,300
about 3% of its GDP,

90
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,110
or 200 billion dollars every year.

91
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,370
China’s former head of state,

92
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,040
Hu Jintao,

93
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,840
said it could even tear the Communist Party
apart.

94
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,420
But like ripping off a Band-Aid,

95
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,320
getting rid of corruption is going to be painful.

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,120
Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,510
is actually contributing to China’s economic
slowdown,

98
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,110
at least in the short term.

99
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,020
Officials are terrified of being hit with
a corruption charge.

100
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,510
As a result, many officials aren’t approving
new projects,

101
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,120
so things just don’t get done.

102
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,140
And the extravagant banquet industry is hurting,
too.

103
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,870
But perhaps the greatest victim is luxury
goods.

104
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,810
Imports are down 55%.

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,860
Sadly,

106
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,320
this means that China’s gift recycling industry

107
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,920
is feeling the pain as well.

108
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,740
Just when I needed their help, too.

109
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,240
Uh,

110
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,920
could I interest anyone out there in a unique,

111
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,880
handpainted interpretation of the Last Supper?

112
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,580
So what do you think of China’s corruption
based economy?

113
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,720
Can it survive an anti-corruption drive?

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
Leave your comments below.

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,120
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,420
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

117
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,670
See you next time!
