1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,060
Well...

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,060
Marseille's better.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,160
You've got the weather, haven't you, for the
duelling down in Marseille, yeah?

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,340
The weather for it(!)

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,900
"Turned out nice again!"

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,720
"Can we not duel today, it's that wet rain
that'll soak you through?"

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,410
"I've got it on my glasses,
I can't see where to stab!"

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,910
It's a point,
that's why I bought my flat cap.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,060
Best thing I ever had,
my glasses are dry now.

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,140
What? For getting stabbed?

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,420
Well, I can duel…

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,020
"I went to Marseille hoping to get stabbed!

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,920
"Couldn't even start a duel, couldn't hit
the other fella."

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,790
"Glasses misted up, flat cap, see perfectly,
three confirmed kills."

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,660
Is this Yorkshire duelling?

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,270
Do you just, like, wear big trousers

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,970
and throw ferrets at each other or something
like that?

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,970
Okay, that's…

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,480
Well, if you want to find out, keep up with
the insults, pal(!)

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,280
To be fair, ferret wrestling is actually a
sport in ancient Yorkshire, was it not?

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,540
And by ancient I mean 1980.

22
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,160
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom...

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,560
You know, ferret- it's a circus act isn't
it, putting ferrets down your trousers?

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,399
Well, I've pulled up the article...

25
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,219
You can get two down there.

26
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,979
They both seem fine though!

27
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,170
They're not worried.

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170
They're not fighting.

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,170
They're peacefully co-existing.

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,130
I can't believe I'm going on to this article,

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,550
and to anyone who is hoping for this to be
an examination of the life of Julie d'Aubigny...

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,160
I've just pulled up the article on
ferret legging.

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,560
Which it turns out, is a thing.

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,659
It is, as practised by to-be-seventh Doctor
Who Sylvester McCoy, in his circus days.

35
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,659
Really?

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,659
Yes, along with hammering nails up his nose
and setting his head on fire.

37
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,869
Gosh.

38
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,670
Take that Capaldi, keep up, come on.

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,069
How much livestock have you had down your
breeches?

40
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,069
None.

41
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,069
Could you explain ferret legging?

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,959
'Cos there are some easy points
for the Yorkshiremen here,

43
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,189
well for one of the Yorkshiremen.

44
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,780
Well, we all do it, of course, for
the New Years' Eve...

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,969
As I understand it, don't you sort of tie
the bottom of your trousers with string

46
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,770
to stop an easy ferret escape as t'were?

47
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,159
Because they are clever little souls

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,720
and they'll work their way that
round the ankles is a good way out.

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,860
You drop 'em in.

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,489
I'm not sure what the middle bit is, right?

51
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:13,799
Once they're in, I'm not sure…

52
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:14,810
Great pain, I think!

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,810
Step 3, profit.

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,830
Yes, step 3, profit, yes.

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,580
So, actually, I'm giving you a point for the
general thing,

56
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,140
but you also get a point, Will, for the phrase,
"Great pain".

57
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,879
It's an endurance event.

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,010
Right.

59
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,030
It is an endurance event.

60
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,560
What is the current world record for having
a ferret down your trousers?

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Single ferret?

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,010
Single ferret.

63
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,620
Is it awake or asleep?

64
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,470
If it's asleep you're cheating.

65
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,189
Yes, and I'm going to say, and angry.

66
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,379
I'm going to say, it's got to be less than
an hour,

67
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,810
because otherwise then the ferret is having
a nap.

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,459
Two hundred and seventy four days,

69
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,739
but the bloke that's achieved it

70
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,840
doesn't really want to report it to the record
books for Reasons…

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm going to say 12 minutes.

72
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,629
I'm going to say three hours.

73
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,900
Yep, 5 hours 30 minutes
is the current world record.

74
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,840
We should point out:
ferrets are angry. In general.

75
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,200
I'd be angry if you stuffed me down somebody's
trousers!

76
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,620
"Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor
can the ferrets be sedated."

77
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:09,830
There we go, fair rules.

78
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,840
What are you not allowed to wear?

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
Shorts.

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,019
Oh no, it's pants.

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,019
It's pants.

82
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,019
It's underwear, absolutely right.

83
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,019
Oh, the horror.

84
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,019
Oh my God.

85
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,220
I'm just thinking, there's a famous clip,
isn't there?

86
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,230
The late departed Richard Whiteley who fronted
a chat show for a very small amount of time

87
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,900
and the only thing that happened to him was
someone brought a ferret on

88
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,069
and he went to stroke the ferret

89
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,750
and the ferret bit his finger and wouldn't
let go.

90
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,830
And the shot is of Richard Whiteley lifting
the ferret up

91
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,720
as it dangles off his finger while he screams.

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,260
Imagine that with your gentlemen's bits!

93
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,140
Yes, so…

94
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,359
They don't let go!

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,940
"The ferret must have a full set of teeth
that have not been filed..."

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,600
And I'm giving you a point specifically for
that phrase, because it says,

97
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,980
"The sport is said to involve an ability to
have your tool bitten and not care."

98
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,120
I could probably take the first,

99
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,310
I think the second is where I start to struggle.

100
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,520
And if there is ever a sign that this is quite
a blokey show,

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,269
it's the fact that we have gone
from Julie D'Aubigny

102
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,840
to ferrets biting people's tools.

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,329
I don't think that counts as an ability.

104
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,640
Well, to be fair the ferret is doing all the
work isn't it?

105
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Yes!

106
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,780
What can you attempt to do to dislodge the
ferret?

107
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,810
Shout at it, convince it nicely,

108
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,300
maybe give it some reading matter,

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,840
maybe give it a brochure for the lower end
of the trouser

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,660
and encourage it to go on a holiday down there.

111
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,940
It's a ferret tourist destination shop,
you know?

112
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,930
"No, I'm happy here!"

113
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,930
Yes.

114
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,350
You can attempt to dislodge the ferret,

115
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,090
but that can be difficult.

116
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,930
This is a thoroughly well-referenced article
by the way,

117
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,940
better referenced than the historical one…

118
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,740
Does it just say at the bottom, 'I watched
a bloke do this?'

119
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Possibly.

120
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,430
This is the kind of thing they do in Pudsey
on a Wednesday night, isn't it?

121
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,610
Well, where may it have come from?

122
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,750
Er, the Vikings.

123
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,750
Not quite.

124
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,310
Why might you want to try and conceal a ferret
in your trousers?

125
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,310
Oh, poaching!

126
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,310
Oh, yeah!

127
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,919
Yes, absolutely right, to avoid detection
by gamekeepers.

128
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,720
I can say if a ferret is biting your cock
very hard

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,870
it's going to be very difficult not to be
given away when being a poacher.

130
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,060
I don't think you can stifle a cry that long

131
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,460
if we're talking hours' worth here.

132
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,533
Can you not just do that thing in
'Danny, the Champion of the World'

133
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,230
and tickle a fish until it falls asleep?

134
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,789
There's easier ways of making a living,
you know!

135
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,840
"Oh, another screaming person
leaving the park.

136
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,300
"Nothing untoward there(!)"

137
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,120
Well, there is a former world…

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,420
"How you doing, Jake?"

139
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
"Fi-i-i-ine...."

140
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,320
There is a former world champion whose name
is Reg Mellor and…

141
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,330
Of course, it's a Reg.

142
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,169
It couldn't be anything but a Reg, could it?

143
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:37,370
Who is credited with introducing what tradition?

144
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,610
And it's a clothing tradition.

145
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,610
Is it an ice bath?

146
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,840
No, it's a clothing tradition,
during the event?

147
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Skinny-legged jeans.

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,940
It can't actually move once you've got it
wedged in there.

149
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,940
There's a thought, yeah.

150
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,740
Is there a requirement of the tightness of
lower-end clothing?

151
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,660
No, this is actually a lovely connection back
to duelling scars.

152
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Swords.

153
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,960
Duelling scars, not duelling- they're not
duelling with ferrets.

154
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,340
Going back to my scars on people's arses as
a matter of bravery…

155
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,240
No, but in roughly the same way

156
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,100
that you would show off a duelling scar,

157
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,160
that you might want to make it worse,

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,199
you might want to make it clear what…

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,289
He drops his trousers
to show his ferret scars.

160
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:10,870
No, it's a clothing tradition.

161
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,110
Is it…?

162
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,349
Ragged trousers.

163
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,120
♪ Dirty shirt! ♪

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,540
Moleskin kind of corduroys, because they don't
rip as easy.

165
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,500
Some sort of crotchless trouser...?

166
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,080
I think that's chaps, isn't it?

167
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,160
That's the one!

168
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Chaps.

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
No, white trousers.

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Why?

171
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,200
- Blood.
- To show the blood?

172
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,759
Yes. You got there first.

173
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh my God.

174
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,260
To show the blood from the wounds caused by
the ferrets.

175
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,150
Now, I would take up a job as
a painter and decorator

176
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,740
and then whenever I paint a room red I'd come
out and go,

177
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,940
"Look at that!
Ferret Champion of the World yet again!"

178
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,280
And no one would argue.
