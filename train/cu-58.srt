1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,230
It’s the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square Massacre

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,840
The US Secretary of State says China Stole
US Military Secrets

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,760
And what Chinese authorities say is the biggest
risk

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,160
for Chinese visitors in the United States

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,300
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,780
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,160
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,500
This week’s China news headlines.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,419
You know, camera technology has sure improved

10
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:32,599
over the last, let’s say 30 years.

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,910
Consider this grimy old photo from 1989.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,500
You can barely see what’s going on.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,330
But with the new Huawei P30 Pro,

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,910
photos become much more accurate!

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,989
An image that’s so crystal clear, it’s
invisible.

16
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,370
And that’s not all.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,210
With the P30 Pro’s new “China Dream”
filter,

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,030
a pesky message about freedom from tyranny...

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,530
Gets much more patriotic.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,750
That banner now says “Go Huawei!”

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,140
As it should.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,620
That Huawei photo, by the way,

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,540
is a joke that Chinese netizens are passing
around on WeChat.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,689
As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says,

25
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,369
“Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese
government.”

26
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,499
And the Chinese government can make beautiful
things with it.

27
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:20,299
Obviously the 30-year anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square Massacre

28
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,759
is big news.

29
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,430
Except in China where it’s no news at all.

30
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,740
And foreign companies are willing to help.

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,829
Like one of Reuters news service’s biggest
partners.

32
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,670
Refinitiv is a data firm that operates in
China,

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,630
providing financial information.

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,389
And citing the legal realities of China blah
blah blah,

35
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,260
they decided to block anything to do with

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,399
the Tiananmen Square Massacre

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,020
on their data terminals in China.

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,600
Somewhat ironically,

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,310
that meant also blocking Reuters articles.

40
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,570
According to Reuters,

41
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,130
“Refinitiv took the action to block the
stories last week

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,659
after the Cyberspace Administration of China,

43
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,689
which controls online speech,

44
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,150
threatened to suspend the company’s service
in China

45
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,689
if it did not comply.”

46
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,609
“However, many users outside of China

47
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,299
said they could not see the stories.”

48
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,099
Maybe they were all using phones made by Huawei.

49
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,430
Which brings us back to Mike Pompeo.

50
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,791
The US Secretary of State is saying China
stole US secrets

51
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,090
to build up their own military.

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,750
Shocking, I know.

53
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,730
Fortunately the US Department of Defense

54
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,640
has come up with a novel solution.

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,510
See, a few days ago,

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,840
it was reported that the Department of Defense

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,739
accidentally bought $20 million dollars worth
of phony military gear

58
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,180
made in China.

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,250
But I say, it was no accident.

60
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Because now,

61
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,670
when the Chinese military steals American
technology,

62
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,360
they’ll be stealing back their own stuff
that doesn’t work!

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,330
Very art of war.

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,830
China has launched a rocket to space from
a cargo ship at sea.

65
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,459
That makes China the first country to fully
own and operate

66
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,689
a floating launch platform for space missions.

67
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,030
Why that’s an advantage, I’m not sure.

68
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,900
Maybe they were inspired by Waterworld.

69
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,860
But the China National Space Administration

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,140
said in a statement,

71
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,530
“Launching a rocket from the sea

72
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,280
has the advantages of high flexibility,

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,370
good adaptability for specific tasks,

74
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,480
and excellent launch economy.”

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,260
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

76
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,660
Maybe when they launch a rocket

77
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,890
from the ancient Chinese territory of the
South China Sea,

78
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,760
wherever it lands also becomes ancient Chinese
territory.

79
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,489
Now like many things made in China,

80
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,200
the idea for the launch platform was actually
stolen.

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,599
Back in the late ’90s, the United States,
Norway, Russia, and Ukraine

82
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,590
teamed up to build a sea launch service called...

83
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,790
wait for it...

84
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,330
“Sea Launch.”

85
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,590
But the program was shut down in 2014,

86
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,230
after Russia decided Ukraine was a part of
Russian territory

87
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,269
since ancient times.

88
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,760
Meanwhile in Hong Kong,

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,319
thousands of lawyers took to the streets

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,190
to protest a proposed extradition law.

91
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,239
That law would allow criminals to be extradited

92
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,020
from Hong Kong to mainland China for the first
time.

93
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,700
People like corrupt Chinese officials and
businesspeople

94
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,069
who have fled to Hong Kong.

95
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,500
But the proposed law has made many Hongkongers
nervous,

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,599
since what’s considered a crime in Hong
Kong versus the mainland

97
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,659
can be a little different.

98
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,620
Also there’s the whole lack of rule of law
in mainland China issue.

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,690
Now you know things are bad

100
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,950
when the lawyers start protesting in the streets.

101
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,650
Looks kind of like a giant...black parade.

102
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,910
I mean, who died, am I right?

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,180
What’s that, Shelley?Oh right, Hong Kong’s
freedoms have died.

104
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,120
How about we talk about the trade war?

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,590
Nice simple happy trade war.

106
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,160
According to the International Monetary Fund,

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
President Trump’s tariffs are having an
impact on China.

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,729
“The trade tensions have had an impact,

109
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,419
significant, but in our view,

110
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,870
so far contained.”

111
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,789
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has decided to focus
on the “contained” part.

112
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,740
He said “Looking into the future,

113
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,949
China’s economy bears the supporting conditions
for stable,

114
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,250
healthy and sustainable growth.”

115
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,840
He said that just before he traveled to Russia
to meet Putin,

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,190
where Xi said, I kid you not,

117
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,120
“He is my best and bosom friend.

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,340
I cherish dearly our deep friendship.”

119
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,250
I mean obviously.

120
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,550
This time last year Xi gave putin a best friends
forever medal.

121
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,630
Oh my gosh, Russia collusion is real!

122
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,620
It’s just China-Russia collusion.

123
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,710
And I’m sure nobody would be interested
in that story.

124
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,000
For the past two years,

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,860
the US government has been making it harder

126
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,229
for Chinese students to get visas to study
here.

127
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,520
The concern is potential espionage.

128
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,639
The US government is also making it more restrictive

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,300
for Chinese nationals to get work visas

130
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,889
in sensitive fields related to national security,

131
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,180
like the semiconductor industry.

132
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,849
So the Chinese Communist Party has pulled
the classic,

133
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,880
“Well we don’t want to send people to
your stupid country anyway.”

134
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,860
They’ve warned Chinese citizens not the
visit or study in the US,

135
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,509
saying “Students and scholars [should] strengthen
risk assessments

136
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,650
before going abroad to study.”

137
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,300
Specifically, “The Ministry of Culture and
Tourism

138
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,940
warned of threats such as robbery and gun
violence” in America.

139
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,620
Yes, America is dangerous because of all the
criminals with guns!

140
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,830
Whereas China is only dangerous because of
all the soldiers with tanks.

141
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,169
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

142
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,979
a fan who support China Uncensored

143
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,849
with a dollar or more per episode,

144
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,490
by contributing through Patreon.

145
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,330
Largezo asks,

146
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,410
“What actually started the events

147
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,910
leading to the 1989 Tienanmen square massacre?

148
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,110
A protest against corrupt government officials?

149
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Good question!

150
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,699
So it has to do with these two guys,

151
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,850
Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang.

152
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,949
The Paramount leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping

153
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,530
called them his left and right hands.

154
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,220
They were very high ranking officials,

155
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,520
charged with pushing forward Deng’s economic
reforms.

156
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,820
But they were also keen on making political
and social reforms,

157
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,020
like investigating the hidden wealth of other
top officials.

158
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,720
That made them very popular with the average
citizen,

159
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,420
but not so popular with the average high ranking
official.

160
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,629
So other Communist Party members purged Hu
Yaobang in 1987.

161
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,630
And when he died in April 1989,

162
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,419
people showed up in Tiananmen Square to mourn
him.

163
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,050
And then they decided, well, while we’re
here in Tiananmen,

164
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,909
let’s push the democratic reforms that Hu
Yaobang had wanted.

165
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,139
They continued their protest for weeks.

166
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,539
In hindsight, maybe they should have gone
with a different slogan.

167
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,580
The protests spread around the country,

168
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,389
and people were asking for greater economic
and political reforms.

169
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,250
But they were not asking to overthrow the
Chinese Communist Party.

170
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,780
But that’s not how the Communist Party took
it.

171
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,509
Anyway, I also mentioned Zhao Ziyang.

172
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:44,889
He supported the students,

173
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,800
by telling them to leave the Square for their
own safety.

174
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Bad move.

175
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,720
For that, he got purged, too.

176
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,069
And spent the rest of his life under house
arrest.

177
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:56,759
And he was replaced with everyone’s

178
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,479
least favorite toad, Jiang Zemin.

179
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,500
And the rest is China Uncensored history.

180
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,280
This is of course the extreme cliff notes
version.

181
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,759
We’ve done several episodes

182
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,660
on the Tiananmen Square Massacre over the
years.

183
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,870
I’ve put links to those episodes below.

184
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,350
Thanks for your question, Largezo.

185
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,010
And thanks to everyone watching!

186
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,449
We could not make this show without your support.

187
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,949
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

188
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,669
or just watching and sharing the show

189
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,069
with your friends and family.

190
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,069
So thank you from me

191
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,439
and everyone on the China Uncensored team.

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,620
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

193
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
see you next time.
