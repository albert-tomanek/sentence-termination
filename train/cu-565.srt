00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
Millions of Hong Kongers Take to the Street

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,939
Find Out How One Independent Media

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,880
Is bringing truth to Hong Kong

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm Shelley Zhang.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,340
And joining us today is Tom Grundy,

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,699
the editor-in-chief and co-founder of Hong
Kong Free Press,

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,099
which in my opinion, is one of like,

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,100
the best sources for news about Hong Kong,
so thanks ...

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,099
Thanks for joining us today, Tom.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,320
Thanks for having me, with this delightful,
fake aloe vera plant.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,140
That's fake?

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,210
It's not real.

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,210
Really?

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,210
Wow.

17
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,460
Between one aloe vera plant with Chris Chappell.

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,440
Well, it's going to be a pointed conversation.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,940
Right.

20
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:40,949
Oh, god.

21
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:41,949
Anyway, it's lovely.

22
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:42,980
Oh, I see what you did there.

23
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,980
Thank you.

24
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
I get it.

25
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,980
Already with the comedy gold.

26
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,350
Yeah, you know it just rolls off my tongue.

27
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,050
We've been here almost through ...

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,250
Leaf it out.

29
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
Yes.

30
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,250
Oh.

31
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,440
And if that question was planted ...

32
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Oh, no.

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh my god.

34
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,630
Oh, jeez, we're really in the dirt here.

35
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,630
Okay.

36
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,730
Well, everyone has stopped watching now,

37
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,730
which is unfortunate.

38
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,730
Right.

39
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,930
Oh, we can say anything.

40
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,930
Yeah.

41
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,409
But, yeah, so, we've known each other since
like, 2014,

42
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,619
when the Umbrella Movement, right?

43
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,909
Yeah, where it hit the fan five years ago.

44
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,159
And this was a big surprise, last few days,

45
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,130
the biggest protest in Hong Kong history,

46
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,369
because another perfect storm.

47
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,369
The momentum seemed so low, I think,

48
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,750
among democrats in Hong Kong.

49
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,750
A lot of exhaustion.

50
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,060
But yeah, you never know what can happen.

51
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,920
Yeah, we were hear in 2016, and people seemed
pretty depressed.

52
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,090
Yeah, it's been very fractured, in-fighting,

53
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,430
and seeing the same old faces,

54
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,360
just a few hundred people often at protests.

55
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,790
But as one of our columnists, Steve Vine said,

56
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,130
"Do not bet against the Hong Kong people".

57
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,130
So, what happened?

58
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,020
What sparked the movement again?

59
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,829
Well, this has been months in the making,
since February,

60
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,750
when the government tabled a plan for extradition
agreements,

61
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,180
with territories with which it doesn't currently
have

62
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,509
any fugitive transfer agreements with.

63
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,060
And it was in response to a Taiwan murder
case.

64
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,070
But of course, you've just disturbed a wasps
nest here,

65
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,720
because if you're going to make agreements
with Taiwan,

66
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,789
as far as China is concerned, that's China.

67
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,840
So, we don't really understand how much this

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,950
was the local administrations decision,

69
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,060
to try and push this case by case extradition
system they want,

70
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,640
with territories where there's no private
agreement.

71
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,390
Or whether it was Beijing pushing for this.

72
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,879
But, in either case now, government is on
full face-saving mode,

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,930
because we've seen, you know,

74
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,810
just a week of huge protests,

75
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,400
filling the streets in Hong Kong.

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,170
People of all ages.

77
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,170
And a lot of anger,

78
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,680
even after those initial protests,

79
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,099
about the government reaction.

80
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,659
So, a lot of people have been saying,

81
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:45,830
"Well, don't Hongkongers understand,

82
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,819
there are a lot of safeguards in place,

83
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,400
the government has said that,

84
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,560
it wouldn't be used for political cases,

85
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,489
all this stuff",

86
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,440
but Hongkongers still seemed to say,

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
"No, this is not okay".

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Yeah.

89
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
So, Hong Kong has a very different legal system

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
to the mainland here.

91
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,900
We've inherited the common law British system,
I suppose.

92
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,252
And you still have the judges in wigs,

93
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,709
and this kind of thing.

94
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,989
And in the mainland,

95
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,830
there's always a lot of concerns about human
rights,

96
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,420
black jails, these kinds of things,

97
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,830
indefinite detentions seemingly,

98
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,140
and the death sentence.

99
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,819
And just how broadly some laws are applied.

100
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,760
Particularly to stifle descent.

101
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,200
And we've seen a crack down

102
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,840
since the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong,

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,959
with democratically elected law makers ousted
from the legislature,

104
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,360
certain political parties banned,

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
people being prevented from even standing
from election.

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,629
As well as democrats, and activists,

107
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,790
and organized the Umbrella Movement to jail,

108
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,569
including academics and law makers,

109
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,769
using quite draconian, archaic, colonial laws.

110
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,459
So, with just the track record in Hong Kong,

111
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,510
and what we see over the border,

112
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,590
the Missing Booksellers incident and the treatment

113
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,160
of lawyers and dissidents in the mainland,

114
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,680
Hongkongers are pretty skeptical about these
so-called assurances.

115
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,270
And we've seen a chorus of criticism

116
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,730
from every possible sector you can imagine.

117
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,750
From religious sectors,

118
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,079
to people who aren't meant to speak up,

119
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,480
like lawyers, judges even, journalists,

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,930
who are meant to all be you know, a-political,

121
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,040
have been raising the alarm.

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,940
Not to mention foreign governments,

123
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,670
businesses, local and foreign,

124
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,820
all putting out statements and petitions.

125
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,750
We've not just seen thousands of petition
signatures,

126
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,260
but hundreds of actual petitions

127
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,640
from the most obscure groups in the city.

128
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,890
So, that kind of escalated into the protests
we've seen

129
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,240
over the last week, or so.

130
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,170
Well, I've been really impressed with some
of the coverage

131
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,790
you guys have done of this.

132
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,400
Like, you're people are getting right into
the teargas.

133
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,370
Yeah, don't tell anyone we've done this.

134
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,430
We've done this with like, three people,

135
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,670
myself and two reporters and ...

136
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,600
You're [crosstalk] is three people?

137
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,010
Yeah, one guy is on holiday.

138
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,010
But ...

139
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,010
Perfect.

140
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,560
So, yeah, we've battled through,

141
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,980
and got a lot of traction and attention, I
think,

142
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,980
with our coverage.

143
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,080
Not to mention support with our funding drive
that's going on.

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,020
But, yeah, I'm very proud of the team.

145
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,960
I asked them not to, but, yes,

146
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,670
Kris just runs straight into the fire, you
know,

147
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,750
often with his reporting, literally ...

148
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,890
And you're not talking about me, because I
would run the opposite way.

149
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,890
That's what I do.

150
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,890
In fact, there's footage of him

151
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,270
going on Facebook live straight into the teargas,

152
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,950
whilst I'm yaba-daba-doo-ing on the legislative
door, saying,

153
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,930
"Let me the hell in".

154
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,910
So, yeah, I'm quite the opposite.

155
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,650
But, it's a bit sad that we are having to
resort to you know,

156
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,580
investing in gas masks and gear,

157
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,560
and we may have to, before the week is out,

158
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,170
once again break these things out.

159
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,960
Because it's the journalists association here
was noted, you know,

160
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,510
there's been some rather questionable incidents

161
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,860
with journalists seemingly targeted,

162
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,300
and becoming injured in the fracas we've seen
lately.

163
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,320
Talking about whom?

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,550
Our staff have been okay.

165
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,840
But, the police action was pretty all-encompassing

166
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,540
when teargas was released, in particular.

167
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,830
They've used rubber bullets and bean bag shots,

168
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,080
which is unprecedented in Hong Kong,

169
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,490
and certainly journalists have been caught
up in the fray.

170
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,600
And often times, there's been no other protesters
around.

171
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,150
So, there have been a lot of questions

172
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,260
about press freedom over the last few days.

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,460
But, yeah, a lot of just, activists,

174
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,460
protesters are concerned about how indiscriminate

175
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,900
the police action has been,

176
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,640
when even they admit only five were arrested
for actual rioting.

177
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Just a quick technical question,

178
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,630
do you mind if we overlay some of the footage
...

179
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,040
Course, have what you want.

180
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,520
As long as it's not Marta's news wire,

181
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,811
you're welcome to it.

182
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,300
No, no, it would be great to show some of
Hong Kong.

183
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,880
Yeah, I think it would.

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Yeah, that's fine.

185
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,770
There's a moment in a particular video of
Kris,

186
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,570
where he's showing how protesters are so organized,

187
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,470
and it's all a leaderless sort of, grass roots
sort of, effort.

188
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,990
And they're throwing towels and things over
the teargas canisters,

189
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,990
and such cooperation.

190
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,570
And all of this gear,

191
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:55,600
you know, goggles, and clingfilm they're using,

192
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,020
and masks just appears out of nowhere.

193
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,390
It's incredibly organized.

194
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,190
But also, leaderless.

195
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,380
Very dynamic.

196
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,780
It's a lot of encrypted like,

197
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,320
messaging apps, and certain forums online,

198
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,940
where people are up-voting and down-voting

199
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,190
civil disobedience ideas, anonymously.

200
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,590
So, you try and speak to anyone as a leader,

201
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,590
and no one will admit to it.

202
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,740
In fact, very few people like to give their
names,

203
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,750
or show their faces in ways

204
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,080
that we didn't really see in the Umbrella
Movement.

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,390
People are a lot more nervous now.

206
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,530
So, people have said that that's one of the
major differences,

207
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,530
the leaderless-ness.

208
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,440
Are there other things that are different
from like, 2014?

209
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,300
I'd say that's the main stuff.

210
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Mm-hmm.

211
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,650
I can't think of what else.

212
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,530
But, in other ways, we have seen a repeat
of some of those scenes,

213
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,260
and how it's the politest protest in the world.

214
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,230
And people are recycling, and there's no one
playing music,

216
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,110
or guitars, or anything in these protests.

217
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,840
Well, there's some music out there.

218
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,890
There's the Sing Hallelujah thing.

219
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,600
Which seems to be designed,

220
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,910
partially to annoy the police.

221
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,160
And I can't sleep at night,

222
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,410
because this song is in my head.

223
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,650
Oh, us too.

224
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,140
Us too.

225
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,280
And it kind of, brings me back to…

226
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Us too.

227
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Any other song.

228
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Please, next.

229
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
So, yeah, there's T-shirts with, "Sing Hallelujah",

230
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
and this kind of thing.

231
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
And that's because doing that

232
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,570
gets the rally classified as a religious gathering,

233
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,140
so the police can't arrest them.

234
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,140
I think there was ...

235
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,880
the Christians did mobilize this week ...

236
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Mm-hmm.

237
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
For sure.

238
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
And they've been urging Carrie Lam,

239
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
who is a Christian,

240
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,500
they are disproportionately represented in
politics in Hong Kong.

241
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,520
There is talk of how, yes, if you make it
a religious gathering,

242
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,420
you don't need the permits or whatnot.

243
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,409
So, there's been chanting, and Buddhist chanting,

244
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,530
as well as Christian chanting on the front
lines.

245
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,260
Also, it's kind of annoying.

246
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,440
For hours on the front lines,

247
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,990
they were singing that.

248
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,060
So, I'm sure that's just a bonus, or something.

249
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,960
But, it hulks back to 2014,

250
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,070
when they were ... sometimes some pro-Beijing
agitators

251
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,650
who would come into the scene during some
of the occupation.

252
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,950
And to sort of undermine them,

253
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,620
people would gather round and start singing,

254
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
"Happy Birthday to you,

255
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Happy Birthday to you,

256
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
Happy Birthday to you".

257
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Oh, yeah, I remember this.

258
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
I remember this, yeah.

259
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,640
So, that was funnier.

260
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,020
This is kind of, kill me.

261
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,240
Any other song.

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,580
But it is kind of, funny though,

263
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,430
that the way that they try to troll the police
is with a hymn.

264
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,060
Like, there's just something like ...

265
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,700
just like the whole ...

266
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,990
it's the video of the protesters putting out
trash fires,

267
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,080
and things like that.

268
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah, you see tension both sides,

269
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,380
and people losing their tempers,

270
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,200
police and protesters.

271
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
What also gets me though,

272
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,180
is all these videos have emerged,

273
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,890
and angers really built up over the police
reaction,

274
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,380
is the naivety of this being 2019,

275
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,510
and the fact that you are going to be filmed
from every angle,

276
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,390
including from above, by drones,

277
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,080
by people in surrounding buildings.

278
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,550
And live steamed.

279
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,570
And any instance of misconduct,

280
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,660
is going to be widely scrutinized and shared.

281
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,650
And yet, one of the big demands of the last
few days,

282
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,460
is for the police to take responsibility

283
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,570
for some of those alleged cases of police
brutality.

284
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,080
And yet, the authorities have just said,

285
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,390
"Oh, we have the mechanism for this,

286
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,580
and they can make a complaint".

287
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,150
The trouble is in Hong Kong,

288
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,760
the police complaints mechanism,

289
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
is part of the police.

290
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mm-hmm.

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, you're asking the police

292
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
to go investigate themselves.

293
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,720
So, that's a bit broken as well.

294
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,890
But, as far as those demands,

295
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,160
asking Carrie Lam to resign, retract the bill,

296
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,090
for the police to take responsibility for
some of their actions,

297
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,420
and fourthly, to re-categorize,

298
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,000
or re-characterize last weeks unrest with
the teargas,

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,770
and retract it's characterization as a riot.

300
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,310
These have ... none of these have been met.

301
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,000
And we may see an escalation this week,

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,470
if there isn't more response on it.

303
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,360
Because all they've done is apologize,

304
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,000
and say it's being postponed.

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,860
This issue with it being characterized as
a riot by the way,

306
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,820
is because again, of some of these colonially
laws.

307
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,990
You could face a decade in prison,

308
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,140
if you are deemed to be present,

309
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,910
and a rioter at these protests.

310
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,720
That seems pretty harsh for ...

311
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Yeah.

312
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,300
And so, the government again,

313
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,850
have done a mild backtrack with that, and
are saying,

314
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,750
"Oh, only certain people,

315
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,540
committing certain actions will be deemed
rioters,

316
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,290
but the event itself, perhaps not".

317
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,500
But, this again is because of

318
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,050
what we've seen over the last few years.

319
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,570
And there was some unrest in Mong Kok

320
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,400
not long after the Umbrella Movement,

321
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,550
and people have faced harsh prison sentences,

322
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,430
and a couple have fled.

323
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,750
One to Taiwan,

324
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,520
there's another to Germany,

325
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,730
where they were granted asylum.

326
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,520
So, yeah, people are very concerned.

327
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
That's why they're covering their faces a
lot of the time,

328
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,410
and are kind of media shy.

329
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,960
Well, that's one of the things ...

330
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
you were talking about

331
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,250
how violent the police reaction was,

332
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,860
and that was something that surprised me,

333
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,620
because we saw in the Umbrella Movement

334
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,940
that when footage of the police like,

335
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,720
firing teargas or pepper spray at the protesters,

336
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,650
that's what mobilized more people to come
out.

337
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,540
And last week you saw police doing it,

338
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,670
but way more, and then specifically targeting
journalists,

339
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,290
and saying things to journalists

340
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,850
that I can't say on this family friendly show.

341
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,520
So, why was that decision happen?

342
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,790
It's very true.

343
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,570
If you go down to the first day of the occupation,

344
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,800
the 79 day protest in 2014, if you spoke to
anybody,

345
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,190
they weren't really talking about democracy.

346
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,780
It was about the use of teargas.

347
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,450
Hongkongers are pretty allergic to even seeing
this on TV.

348
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,690
It may be partly that many of recent generations

349
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,300
fled the mainland from unrest and drama there,

350
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,530
let alone the riots we had in the '50's, '60's
here.

351
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,350
So, there's a really low tolerance,

352
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,740
and it's really struck me again,

353
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,930
despite my years here,

354
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,610
how that can really mobilize people on to
the streets.

355
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,510
And it was the same on the first day of occupy
in 2014.

356
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,620
And it was the same when we saw,

357
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,831
according to organizers,

358
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:54,850
two million turn up for that second big march,

359
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,340
people filling the streets.

360
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,490
Again, people were talking a lot about

361
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,970
death of a protester the night before,

362
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,220
about Carrie Lam's response,

363
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,720
and about the use of teargas, and some of
the scenes they saw.

364
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,020
So, those really fed into the huge protest
we saw on Sunday.

365
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Yeah.

366
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
There's another point,

367
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
I've forgotten that I was going to make about
the police action,

368
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
but nevermind.

369
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
All right.

370
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
So, I think one thing people outside Hong
Kong

371
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,020
might not really understand,

372
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,930
is why don't they just vote out Carrie Lam,

373
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,880
or why don't they put pressure on the legislatures

374
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,520
to get rid of the extradition bill.

375
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,529
And, so, I think people don't really understand

376
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,780
the system of government Hong Kong has.

377
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,830
Well, it's small circle elections for Carrie
Lam.

378
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,370
They call her 777,

379
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,300
which for your Cantonese speakers,

380
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,370
they may find that amusing,

381
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,370
but again this is a family show.

382
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,850
But, that's the number of people that voted
for her,

383
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,670
out of a city of seven million.

384
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
Mm-hmm.

385
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,900
So, yes, there is no universal suffrage.

386
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,140
It was apparently promised to Hong Kong.

387
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,110
I think many have given up on the idea

388
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,250
that there will be full democracy here.

389
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,470
But it's special interest sort of, figures,
groups,

390
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,760
who vote for the chief executive every five
years,

391
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,500
as for the legislature, it's dominated by
pro-Beijing law makers,

392
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,900
and almost half of it is not directly elected.

393
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,790
It is basically corporate votes, special interest
groups,

394
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,960
the agriculture sector, the health sector,
social workers.

395
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,061
The textile sector will get a vote in this.

396
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:19,370
If you're part of that industry,

397
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,920
you'll be able to be represented by a law
maker.

398
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,000
But of course, some sectors are way over represented.

399
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,650
Like, how much agriculture, and textiles,

400
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,590
and fishery is going on,

401
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,230
lot of fishery in Hong Kong nowadays.

402
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,170
So, a lot of them are pretty much told how
to told vote,

403
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,220
practically, by the establishment.

404
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,740
And that's how laws like the extradition law,

405
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,540
or even other draconian things that are on
the table,

406
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,279
like the national anthem law, can easily,
basically be passed.

407
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,640
And you'll see the opposition, the democrats,

408
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,440
using all means necessary to try and filibuster
the fact that since 2014,

409
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,029
they've changed to house rules to rob them
of the little power t

410
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:04,460
hey had to even do that.

411
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Mm-hmm.

412
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,230
So, it's become physical rucks even, in recent
weeks,

413
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,360
to try and stop this extradition bill going
through.

414
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,750
But, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more,

415
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,870
because they're kind of, powerless.

416
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,100
And as I said, the balance of power has been
swayed

417
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,980
back to the pro-Beijing camp,

418
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,260
because they've been ousting quite a questionable
circumstances.

419
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,820
A lot of the democratically elected law makers

420
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,960
from the local parliament.

421
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,250
Yeah, last time we were here,

422
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,089
it was just around the time when they were
starting

423
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,130
to try to disqualify people for the oath taking
thing.

424
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,130
Yeah.

425
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,029
And we talked along here, and then like ...

426
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,900
They literally changed to constitution to
do that.

427
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,890
So, there's this time bomb in Hong Kong's
mini constitution,

429
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,440
a basic law almost,

430
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,320
whereby if there are any questions over anything
in our mini constitution,

431
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,130
then the people who get to interpret what
was meant,

432
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,290
when it was activated in 1997, in Beijing.

433
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,290
Mm-hmm.

434
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,690
So, what happened with the oath taking scandal,

435
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,330
was that quite a few law makers made protests,

436
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,240
and used some swears during their oaths

437
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,080
as they were being inducted as law makers.

438
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,510
And as this traveled through the courts,

439
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,270
and made it up to the highest court in Hong
Kong,

440
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,260
Beijing swooped in with their interpretation.

441
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,770
They were like, "Hang on a minute,

442
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,360
when it says in the basic law that people
must take their oaths,

443
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,170
you have to do it solemnly, and like, really
meant it".

444
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,920
And so, that's how, in a very convoluted way,

445
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,240
they managed to oust these law makers,

446
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,330
and practically state that because this is
backdated to 1997,

447
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,110
you were never law makers to begin with.

448
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,010
I didn't realize that part.

449
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,010
Right.

450
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,710
And this worries me, about just any law in
Hong Kong,

451
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,060
because after Hong Kong ousted a journalist
last year, Victor Mallet,

452
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,920
after he hosted a talk with a pro-independence
advocate ...

453
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
we broke that story ...

454
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Mm-hmm.

455
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,260
I was like, kissing my permanent residence
card, thinking,

456
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,880
"Okay, great, at least they can't cancel my
visa".

457
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,210
At least they can't take you out, yeah.

458
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,170
But then, at any time, you know,

459
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,230
Beijing can really swoop in, on any of Hong
Kong's ...

460
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,059
That's why there's questions over the rule
of law, even here.

461
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,550
But otherwise, it is considered still pretty
independent.

462
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,449
I had heard that there had been previous incidences

463
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,480
of law makers protesting during the oath.

464
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Yeah.

465
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,120
And there's been incidences of pro-Beijing
law makers

466
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,190
not getting a word quite right, and things
like that.

467
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,040
But, yeah, there is still at least one vacancy

468
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,080
in the current legislative term,

469
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,350
that hasn't been filled.

470
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,940
Well, it hasn't been refilled.

471
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,260
There hasn't been a bi-election for it.

472
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,680
And next year there's going to be another
legislative bi-election.

473
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,540
So, I mean, another thing with this,

474
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,360
is that you've seen, including Denise Ho,

475
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
the Canto pop singer activist,

476
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,230
an effort on the ground during these protests
the last week,

477
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,870
to get people registered to vote,

478
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,930
and to oust the pro-establishment camp.

479
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,230
So, of the little democracy that there is,

480
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,320
at least within just over half of the legislature,

481
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
there is a big effort of try and mobilize,

482
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,050
register people, and have them vote.

483
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,240
Particularly among the people in the thirties,

484
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
who there's not many registered ...

485
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Mm-hmm.

486
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,490
So, people don't really trust this government,

487
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,400
that they have less and less control over,

488
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,620
or less and less say over?

489
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
Yeah.

490
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,740
Well, I think we see this around the world,
at the moment.

491
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,990
Obviously, with the establishment in the US,

492
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,990
and it's very polarized between Trump and
the democrats.

493
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,640
In the UK, everything is now polarized

494
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,820
between remainers and Brexiteers.

495
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,059
China Uncensored, Chris and Shelley.

496
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,900
Right, are you always fighting?

497
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,970
So, here everything is seen through

498
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,500
that lens of pro-democracy, pro-Beijing.

499
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,580
Yeah, I think whenever surveys are done over
how people may vote,

500
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,610
it tends to be the pro-democracy camp

501
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,470
that would generally sweep the poles,

502
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,320
if there was full, you know, suffrage here.

503
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
But, that's not to say that there aren't people,

504
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,680
particularly more rural areas, who do support
China,

505
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,330
and they do vote for the pro-establishment
camp,

506
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,120
as they see them as just being more stability.

507
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,570
And there is frustration often,

508
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,790
with the democrats in Hong Kong

509
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,890
who do focus a lot of constitutional matters,

510
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,179
when you have one of the biggest rich-poor
gaps in the world,

511
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,740
often in the city too.

512
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Mm-hmm.

513
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,650
So, you know, there's often calls that

514
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,470
they focus more on grass roots stuff.

515
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,450
And you see that a lot with Demosisto,

516
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,160
who do a lot more community work now,

517
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
and they're not trying to get law makers into
the legislature,

518
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
because they can't.

519
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Mm-hmm.

520
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,030
And one of the parties that have been affectively
banned.

521
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,240
They've also done a decent job of late,

522
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,350
to try and garner support internationally,

523
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,300
sort of going around the world.

524
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,840
And I think that's what might have lead

525
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,990
Carrie Lam in the last few days,

526
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,350
to make quite suspect claims of foreign interference

527
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,940
in the organization of these protests.

528
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,590
And she's now echoing something her predecessor
CY Leung

529
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,850
said about the Umbrella Movement.

530
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,060
And we're hoping to challenge her on that,

531
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,950
because there isn't really any evidence of
it.

532
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
Mm-hmm.

533
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,870
But, sadly it's true.

534
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,200
The democrats in Hong Kong beyond the legislature,

535
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,120
are trying to do things more on a wider scale,
internationally,

536
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,260
and grass roots in the communities here.

537
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,650
I'll answer a question you didn't ask, there
you go.

538
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,350
I mean, that was fascinating.

539
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,350
That was good.

540
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,990
So, if the democrats, let's say, swept the
elections,

541
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,530
would they be able to get control of the legislature?

542
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes.

543
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,980
They would regain their veto power to stop
things getting through.

544
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Okay.

545
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,179
But at the moment, they don't have that.

546
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,179
Mm-hmm.

547
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:39,150
But , we'll see what happens next year.

548
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,460
These things will probably calm down, but
then ...

549
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,559
I'm sick of being wrong, trying to make predictions.

550
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,559
Uh-huh.

551
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,460
I thought Carrie Lam's apology before the
two million man march,

552
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,220
would really take the wind out of it.

553
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Mm-hmm.

554
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah, I'm just sick of being wrong.

555
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
So, you never know what the next flash point
might be.

556
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,480
But as I say, you've got the national anthem
law,

557
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,000
which could criminalize anyone mocking the
national anthem,

558
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,110
which is going to be difficult for you guys,

559
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,700
who rely on parody and humor.

560
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
They just delayed that, right?

561
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Uh-huh.

562
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
But we're not based in Hong Kong, so ...

563
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Ah, right.

564
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
So, you're immune.

565
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
Still, they might block your YouTube channel.

566
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I just don't know how they're going to do
it.

567
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,810
But we're worried about that, for press freedom.

568
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,810
Mm-hmm.

569
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,980
If we film somebody, you know, Kris,

570
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,160
singing his horrible version of March of the
Volunteers ...

571
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,750
It'd be a winner.

572
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,750
Yeah.

573
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,730
I mean, are we going to be liable?

574
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,360
You can get up to three years in prison.

575
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,970
They're importing this draconian law from
the mainland.

576
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,299
So, it's very unclear how that's going to
be implemented.

577
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,250
And then, on the longer term, you've got Article
23,

578
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,270
the ill-fated national security law, which
...

579
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,440
Are they going to bring it back?

580
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,570
Yeah, that was always permanently shelved,
indefinitely in 2003.

581
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,390
Similar language to what we're seeing now,
but we don't know.

582
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,420
But, certainly Carrie Lam's administration,

583
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,330
and those who she is standing against in the
election,

584
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,060
have said that it does need to be implemented.

585
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,190
So, who knows how harshly perhaps Beijing

586
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,460
might crack down after these scenes,

587
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,750
and insist that it is necessary,

588
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,809
because when it comes to independence,

589
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,380
self determination, or any of these sort of,
seditious ideas,

590
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,690
that's when people start talking about the
need,

591
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,710
apparently for a national security law.

592
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,100
Despite the fact that we already have

593
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,720
a lot of legal tools to tackle,

594
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,299
apparently those kinds of things.

595
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,260
So, you brought up an interesting point.

596
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,450
Are you concerned running an independent newspaper,

597
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,290
about press freedom in Hong Kong?

598
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,380
Well, we were founded as a direct result to

599
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,040
the press freedom concerns in the city,

600
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,780
in that reporters without borders,

601
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,850
commissioned journalists have been charting

602
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,590
a slow decline of Hong Kong's press freedoms,

603
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,740
whether it's been actual attacks on journalists,

604
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,480
commercial boycotts of liberal newspapers,

605
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,040
outspoken columnists or broadcasters

606
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,080
finding their contracts not renewed.

607
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,990
And we've seen the Missing Booksellers case.

608
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,130
Mm-hmm.

609
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,370
So, I think we needed a non-profit alternative,

610
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,260
backed by readers, run by journalists,

611
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,590
where we didn't have any investors or tycoon
billionaire owners,

612
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,000
or Chinese conglomerate behind us.

613
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,540
So, we were founded in 2015,

614
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,920
we've published 14,000 news articles since
then.

615
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,710
And, to answer your question,

616
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,549
I felt that we've built something to resist
every possible kind of,

617
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,140
incursion to the press freedom issues in Hong
Kong.

618
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,670
And we can run it from anywhere as well.

619
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,720
If you've got room if your office, if it comes
to it.

620
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,130
But, yeah, there is this mistrust,

621
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,500
and I don't know particularly when it comes
to these red line issues

622
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,040
that the government is lying out about

623
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,799
interviewing pro-independence people,

624
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,780
as Victor Mallet did, of the FT.

625
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,450
If that could cause us to face some sort of
legal action, or censorship,

626
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,770
I have no idea.

627
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,450
But, we've been set up to weather any storm.

628
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,970
And I'm very proud to say like, just in the
last week,

629
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,500
we've had maybe over a thousand donations.

630
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,700
Small ones, which is really good for our press
freedom,

631
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,210
because we are not sort of, out-able to any
one big donor.

632
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,640
It's a big sort of, grass roots support that
we're seeing.

633
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,440
Not just in donations either, but people have,

634
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,500
over the years donated all their book proceeds,

635
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,140
or they've given us computers, laptops.

636
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,520
I've had people send us winning lottery tickets
in the post,

637
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,850
or thrust cash at me in the street.

638
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,150
Which is very alarming, like a reverse mugging.

639
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,799
Maybe they were soliciting you.

640
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,799
Yeah.

641
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,799
Say it again?

642
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,799
Maybe they were soliciting you.

643
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,799
I don't know.

644
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,600
Well, during the darker times of HKFP, yeah,

645
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,679
all kinds of things I've had to do for cash.

646
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:43,679
But, no ...

647
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,950
For the greater good.

648
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,950
Say what?

649
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,950
For the greater good.

650
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,950
Have to do it, man.

651
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,290
Got to keep Kris paid.

652
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,290
So, no.

653
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,290
Other Kris.

654
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,290
Luckily it's been going ...

655
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,290
Yeah, not you.

656
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,340
Luckily, we've managed to double our income,

657
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,030
double our spending in the second, third year,

658
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,300
invest more in original reporting.

659
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,419
And I was told,

660
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,160
"You can't keep going back to the well,

661
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,900
give it six months, it's dead".

662
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,170
But now, I think it's a model.

663
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,680
And four years on,

664
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,030
next week is our forth birthday,

665
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,660
it kind of works,

666
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,730
is what I would say is our tagline.

667
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,910
It kind of works.

668
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,169
It kind of works.

669
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,600
It's still here, right?

670
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,560
And it is just the four of you, right?

671
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Yeah.

672
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,590
I think we now have just the smaller,

673
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,380
better paid sort of, qualified team.

674
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,380
Mm-hmm.

675
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
And, earlier we ten of us,

676
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,540
interns and all kind of stuff.

677
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,780
But, yeah, we're very proud.

678
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,900
And we all have to do a bit of everything,
but, yeah,

679
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,460
we're a pretty small team that punch above
our weight.

680
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,341
And people are surprised to see that

681
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:40,740
we're in the corner of a co-working space,

682
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,640
and there's like, three or four of us.

683
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,940
But, yeah, we try to appear bigger than we
are.

684
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,100
Same drill for a bear attack.

685
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm sorry we've broken the illusion.

686
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
Thanks, yeah.

687
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,650
Chris thought this whole co-working space
was our office.

688
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,650
It isn't.

689
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,650
Maybe I should start lying, and make us cooler.

690
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,130
Yeah, you're like, "This is us".

691
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,130
Yeah.

692
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,130
Well, I mean, we're also a small team.

693
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,440
We're a three person team.

694
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,990
But you're pumping out videos this week, it's
amazing.

695
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,990
Well, Hong Kong's been very…

696
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,990
It's very fast as well.

697
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,500
And you came to our fundraiser, Friday.

698
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,030
Oh, that was fun.

699
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Yeah.

700
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
Yeah, it was fun,

701
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,110
until the police came to ask us to keep it
down.

702
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,240
Oh, I feel like that was very on-brand for
you.

703
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,130
I mean, if you're going to be an independent
press,

704
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,870
the police showing up to your fundraiser ...

705
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,150
But, do we need five?

706
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,929
And it was the people around here,

707
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:29,630
who are living illegally in the industrial
buildings,

708
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,100
who I think called the police.

709
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
It wasn't that loud.

710
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,630
There's no residential around here?

711
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,630
Not meant to be.

712
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Okay.

713
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,630
People do though.

714
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,630
And it was particularly awkward,

715
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,650
because we were playing a certain tune,

716
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,880
by NWA in the night.

717
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Uh-huh.

718
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,630
So, unless someone had ...

719
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,590
A not family friendly tune, yeah.

720
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,050
Made some adjustments to the playlist.

721
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,400
But, still, that was a fun night.

722
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,710
And I have no idea how we've pulled it off,

723
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,410
but I think we raised over 25,000 Hong Kong,
that night.

724
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,880
So, that combined with our funding drive,

725
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,920
will bolster us a bit in the months to come.

726
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
And hopefully,

727
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,930
I'm looking to cover more China stuff, actually.

728
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,930
Oh, great.

729
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,930
So, we'll see.

730
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,110
Well, I wanted to ask ...

731
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,580
It's very lucrative, by the way.

732
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Oh, yes.

733
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,900
Well, it has more international impact, actually.

734
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,470
Because I think interest comes and goes with
Hong Kong.

735
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,970
At the moment, there's a lot of interest,
but ...

736
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,970
That's true, yeah.

737
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,200
There's a lot of stories we miss every day.

738
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,150
Like, when we do have four reporters,

739
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,590
but we barely get round to all the things

740
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,330
I'd hope and wish for us to do.

741
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,590
Because, not all of it gets into English.

742
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,150
And that's where the deficiency is.

743
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,299
There's been a lot of other news outlets similar
to us in Chinese,

744
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:34,700
who've done even bigger crowd funding efforts.

745
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,880
We were the first, but ...

746
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,780
Yeah, it's kind of, niche already,

747
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,740
in Hong Kong, to be operating in English.

748
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,520
But we want to tell the first draft of history,

749
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,310
want to talk about what's happening in Hong
Kong to people abroad.

750
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,770
And a third of our audience is American.

751
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,770
Wow.

752
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,190
Yeah, so, we want to make sure it's in English.

753
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,140
And there's a lot of blind spots in China.

754
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,960
We haven't got a China reporter at the moment.

755
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,530
We're recruiting, if you know anyone.

756
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,230
Well, if anyone watching wanted to contribute,
how can they ...

757
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,200
Oh, Chris, I'm glad you asked.

758
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,499
Well, we accept most forms of payment,

759
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:08,780
including PayPal, Visa Mastercard,

760
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,480
and even the cash machines that are around
Hong Kong,

761
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
you can do that.

762
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,049
We have book referral links, merch, events.

763
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,049
Wow.

764
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,049
If you can think of it ...

765
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:19,640
We need to learn from you guys.

766
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Yeah.

767
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,490
Just activate every possible income stream,

768
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,059
and hope that the pennies add up to the pounds.

769
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,380
Because for ten years, I avoided journalism,
thinking,

770
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
"Okay, that's broken".

771
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,350
And it didn't get any better.

772
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,280
But, I thought, "Okay, let's do all of the
things,

773
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
and hope it sort of works".

774
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Mm-hmm.

775
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,780
And we are still most reliant on the annual
funding drives,

776
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,240
just like MPR, and a lot of others.

777
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,740
But generally, we're doing what the Guardian
kind of does,

778
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,050
with getting members onboard,

779
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,160
and we've seen a surge in that this week.

780
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,280
But certainly, quick support and it's pretty
self explanatory.

781
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Mm-hmm.

782
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,770
You can donate and support press freedom in
Hong Kong.

783
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,770
Yeah.

784
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,770
We'll put your link in the bottom.

785
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,770
You're a legend.

786
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah, it's S-K ... wait,

787
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Hong ... H-K-F-P.com.

788
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
That's the one.

789
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
All right.

790
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Yeah.

791
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Don't mess it up.

792
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Thanks.

793
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
It's been a long week, so far.

794
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
It's been a long week.

795
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,539
I forget sometimes, yeah.

796
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,290
So, do you think we can get out of Hong Kong
soon?

797
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,900
Or do you think this is going to keep going?

798
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,760
What, can you fly out safely?

799
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Yes.

800
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
No, no, no.

801
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
I mean, like, is there ...

802
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,120
I wouldn't go overboard.

803
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,400
You're going to end up in your own CCTV confessional
special.

804
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
I can see it.

805
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
No, no, no.

806
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
We're not going to Shun Jin.

807
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
That's not what I'm asking you.

808
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,020
No, no, that's way, to fly out ...

809
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,860
What's going to happen in the next few days?

810
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Yeah.

811
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,580
Well, there's talk Friday night of maybe an
escalation,

812
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,880
maybe a bit of argy-bargy, if you sharpen
elbows, I don't know.

813
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,380
But, we're ready for that.

814
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,390
But otherwise, the main organizing pro-democracy
coalition,

815
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,270
some of the human rights activists have said,

816
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,140
"Save your energy till July 1st",

817
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,280
which is the annual pro-democracy march.

818
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,480
So, we'll see if we have a heightened turn
out for that one this year.

819
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,080
We'll be reporting on it.

820
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,190
I wouldn't hang out for another two weeks.

821
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,000
Wait, should we be here till July 1st?

822
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,299
Could you pull that off?

823
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,299
I don't know.

824
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,892
But, that would be the next big flash point
I see.

825
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:08,910
But, we might see a little bit of the unpredictable
scenes tonight,

826
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
we'll see.

827
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,539
Three million people, yeah.

828
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:12,539
Oh.

829
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,270
We better start our own fundraising drive,

830
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,270
so we can stay to July 1st.

831
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,270
There's a patreon.com/chinauncensored.

832
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,270
Yeah.

833
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,270
Or, if anyone wants to give us an Airbnb.

834
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,270
Yeah.

835
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,270
All right, well, Tom ... well, actually,

836
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,270
before I actually wrap it up,

837
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,270
I just wanted to make sure that was everything.

838
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,270
I think that was a good amount of stuff.

839
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,270
I think that was a lot.

840
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,270
It was a lot.

841
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,270
Hope my answers weren't too long.

842
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,270
How long has it been?

843
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,270
Like, half an hour.

844
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,270
It's probably about a good length.

845
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,270
I'm just ... see if we've got ...

846
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,270
No, I think we're good.

847
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,270
All right.

848
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
I think we've got ...

849
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,270
Is there anything you're dying to say, that
you didn't?

850
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
I'll remember as soon as the camera's off
and I leave, I'm sure.

851
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,270
Okay.

852
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,270
You know what it's like.

853
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,270
But I can't remember.

854
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,270
Okay.

855
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,270
The camera's have just been turned off, and
we're done.

856
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,270
No, it's not going to work until I'm sat at
my desk,

857
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,270
hours later, and I'm like, “um…”.

858
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,270
All right.

859
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,270
Okay, then ...

860
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,270
Not tempting to goggle up, Chris?

861
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,270
On the front lines?

862
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,900
Oh, I'm running to the teargas if we're ...

863
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,620
I think the suit and the beard though,

864
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
since you're permanently in that thing,

865
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,690
is going to give you away.

866
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,780
It's grown into my skin.

867
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, I understand below the suit,

868
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,700
you have another suit, so I've been told.

869
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,900
Your birthday suit is just another suit.

870
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
It's just another suit.

871
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,280
Under that, do you just have a tattoo of a
suit?

872
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
No, it's just my skin.

873
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Of the entire ...

874
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
It's suits all the way down.

875
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Suits all the way down.

876
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
You're a Russian doll of suits.

877
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Yes, yes.

878
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,870
I'm more suit now than man.

879
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,980
Got a lot of questions about how you maintain
the beard, as well.

880
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,039
But, maybe for another time.

881
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,039
Oh.

882
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,039
Why?

883
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,039
Do you want to grow one?

884
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,039
It all just connects up, it's just very impressive.

885
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,039
Oh, well, thank you.

886
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,039
You see, Shelley?

887
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,710
Shelley doesn't like the beard.

888
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,710
No?

889
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,710
No.

890
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,710
No.

891
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,320
But, I'm glad you do.

892
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,049
Thank you, Chris.

893
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:31,210
All right.

894
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,210
Oh, I see.

895
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,210
I see.

896
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,210
What's going to happen is now it's going to
be Tom and Chris.

897
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,950
Along with the aloe vera, you know?

898
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,919
I'll shed money at you later.

899
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,919
Okay.

900
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,919
For donations.

901
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,210
We are staying in the Wan Chi area, so we've
noticed ...

902
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,210
Cheers.

903
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,130
I've already had an intimate frisking just
getting this mic on,

904
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,040
so, on that homoerotic note Chris,

905
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,420
I'll let you sign off.

906
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,360
It was a pleasure having you here.

907
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,790
Thank you very much for having me.

908
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,919
It was pleasure for you to have us here.

909
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:57,909
I appreciate you bringing some humor to,

910
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:00,679
can I say [censored]-show?

911
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,039
No.

912
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,400
Okay.

913
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,050
To the drama of the…

914
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,050
Thank you.

915
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,320
Well, you know, it's been a gas.

916
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,809
Quite.

917
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,549
That's not our strongest sign off,

918
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,420
but it happens from time to time.

919
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,780
So, thanks again.

920
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,159
Thanks, Chris.

921
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,690
I'm just here at this point.

922
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,690
Yeah.

923
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,730
Yeah, but check out Hong Kong Free Press,

924
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,210
it's one of the best.

925
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,070
The freest of the presses.

926
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,299
Freest of the presses.

927
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,299
Thank you.

928
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,299
Thanks.

929
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,220
Thank you.
