00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,440
A protest breaks out in China
People demand the truth

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,240
After a student dies mysteriously.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,720
You don’t see protests like this\h
very often in mainland China.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,480
That’s from the city of Chengdu.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,960
Students outside of the No. 49\h
High School there were chanting\h\h

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,640
“We want the truth.” It wasn’t long until\h
Chinese police “handled” the situation.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,880
The crowd is demanding the truth of what happened\h
to a 17-year-old student at their school.\h\h

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
They think authorities at the school and in\h
the government are covering up how he died.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,680
The student, named Lin Weiqi, was\h
found dead at their school on May 9.\h\h

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,560
His mother posted this on social media.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,240
“On May 9th at 9 o’clock, I received a notice\h
from the school that my son had passed away.\h\h

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,760
The school simply informed me that the cause\h
of death was a fall from the corridor…”\h

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
“Now, the school is not letting the\h
parents in to see what happened...\h\h

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
The school immediately dismissed all the class\h
students and warned them to keep silent...

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,800
School authorities had given her practically\h
no information about her son’s death.\h\h

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
Only that he had “fallen”.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,560
According to Radio Free Asia, “Local\h
media mentioned the matter was highly\h\h

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
sensitive in Chengdu, and all media\h
reporters were told not to speak up.”

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,160
Huh, that’s not suspicious.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Then this photo began to\h
circulate on social media.\h\h

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
It’s Lin’s mother holding a picture of\h
him outside the gates of the high school.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
More people began to pay attention to her\h
sad story, wanting to know more details.\h\h

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,320
And they watched how the school did\h
nothing to shed light on the situation.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
His mother then posted, “Last night at 9 o’clock\h
the police station told us what happened...\h\h

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,880
We learned that by the time the ambulance\h
had arrived at 8:30, my son had no heartbeat,\h\h

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,160
and he was taken straight to the\h
funeral home instead of the hospital.”

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,720
“The first thing we did was report this to the\h
police. The police said they would investigate...\h\h

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,320
They showed me surveillance footage of that\h
day, except only the incident was not caught\h\h

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,680
on camera... I read this kind of news many times\h
but never thought it would happen to me one day.”

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,280
How odd that the one time surveillance\h
footage would actually be helpful,\h\h

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,160
it’s not available. Normally, Chinese\h
citizens are under constant surveillance.

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,880
But the incident was getting\h
more and more public attention.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,480
The next afternoon, authorities rushed to\h
release a public notice to address the incident.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,520
It reads, “On May 9th at around 6:40 PM, a\h
student fell from the top floor corridor. The\h\h

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,960
school immediately called the emergency number.\h
By the time an ambulance arrived to investigate,\h\h

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,920
the student already had no pulse. The Public\h
Security Bureau has launched an investigation.\h\h

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
The school expresses its deepest condolences.”

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
So...still no further details on how he died.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
What’s weird is, the nearest hospital\h
is less than 10 minutes from the school.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,040
According to the mother’s social media\h
post, the ambulance arrived at 8:30,\h\h

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
just before she was notified about\h
the death at 9 o ‘clock that evening.\h\h

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,240
But that means the ambulance didn’t arrive\h
until nearly two hours after Lin fell.

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,800
And “When asked about the two-hour delay in\h
telling Lin’s parents of their son’s death,\h\h

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,480
the school’s safety director Mi Ping said\h
that after finding the body at about 7pm,\h\h

46
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,880
all of the form teachers were\h
called to help identify him\h\h

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,240
but the process took a long time due\h
to the injuries he had suffered.”

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,360
And that just raised more\h
suspicion among the public.

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,600
With so many missing details, rumors began to\h
spread suggesting the student had been pushed\h\h

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,720
off the building, or that teachers or students\h
had bullied him into taking his own life.\h\h

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,600
Others began to question if authorities\h
were covering up something even worse.

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Then early the next morning, the ‘Chengdu Chenghua\h\h

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,480
Education Branch’ issued a statement on\h
Weibo—attempting to dispel all the rumors.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,560
“Lin died from a high fall according to the\h
climbing traces, footprints and fingerprints\h\h

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,040
at the scene. It was determined to be a\h
personal act, criminal cases were excluded,\h\h

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,680
and no corporal punishment or insults to students\h
were found in the school...The student was not\h\h

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
found to be bullied at school...The student\h
committed suicide due to personal problems.”

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,720
Yes. He killed himself, completely unprompted—even\h\h

59
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,640
though no students ever bullied him, and\h
school authorities never punished him.\h\h

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,000
It just happens, people. And that’s why\h
state media are not allowed to report on it.

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,320
Then state-run Xinhua said the reason there\h
was no surveillance footage is actually that\h\h

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,840
“[Police officers] had taken away the recording\h
for investigation [as it was] key evidence.”

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,640
Yes, key evidence...of nothing\h
suspicious having happened.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
State media also claimed “Lin’s\h
father had watched the complete\h\h

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
recording on Monday morning\h
in the company of a lawyer.”

66
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,040
Meanwhile, articles began\h
circulating on the Chinese internet,\h\h

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,040
saying the issue had been resolved\h
between the school and Lin’s parents,\h\h

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,000
and they ultimately signed and\h
agreed to have the body cremated.

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,040
But, that might not be true. According\h
to Lin’s parents. His mother said,

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
“I solemnly declare here that I do\h
not agree with the statement issued\h\h

71
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,640
by Chenghua District this morning. There are many\h
questions about the content of their statement!\h\h

72
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,160
I will continue to fight the police and the\h
school to give me the truth. I want to speak\h\h

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,000
with my son’s teachers, and I want to see all\h
the videos! I do not agree with this result.”

74
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,320
Which brings us back to the protests.\h
Students gathered at the school holding\h\h

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,520
white flowers to mourn Lin Weiqi as they chanted,\h\h

76
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,600
calling for the truth. And videos like this caused\h
more anger at the way authorities handled it.

77
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,400
But this protest seems to have brought too much\h
attention—which I’ll explain after the break.

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
Welcome back. After this protest video went viral,\h\h

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,520
authorities had a problem. Not just the problem\h
of how to handle Lin Weiqi’s mysterious death, but\h\h

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,360
also how to handle large numbers of young people\h
protesting, and spreading those videos online.

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,520
Their solution? Blame foreign forces and Hong Kong\h
pro-democracy groups for instigating the protests.

82
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,000
Some Chinese netizens were quick\h
to side with local authorities,\h\h

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,200
and jump on the “hostile\h
foreign forces” bandwagon.

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
Here are some examples:

85
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,080
“Losers, quit the act. To think you flew all\h
the way from Guangdong and Hong Kong with your\h\h

86
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,920
broken Mandarin speech and cameras, wearing\h
masks so no one will recognize who you are.\h\h

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,080
You have some nerve to come\h
to Chengdu and make a scene.”

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,800
Yes, this guy thinks that Hong Kong\h
protesters flew to Chengdu to “make a scene.”

89
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,760
“I can’t take it anymore! Open your eyes everyone,\h
don’t fall into the trap of the foreign forces!\h\h

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,920
Notice how their chanting seems staged!\h
Not to mention everyone was able to hold\h\h

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,520
flowers and cameras, there was even a girl who\h
was assigned to cause a scene in the video!\h\h

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,800
They obviously pushed the girl and\h
made it seem like the police’s fault,\h\h

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,760
when they were actually trying to save\h
her! It’s too obvious, everybody WAKE UP!”

94
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah, wake up, sheeple! Don’t you realize\h
communist authorities are the good guys?!

95
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,120
And then there’s doxxing. This post\h
identifies a woman in the crowd,\h\h

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,920
and claims she’s a friend of someone\h
who worked at the local US consulate.\h\h

97
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,400
The consulate that was closed down last year. And\h
somehow she made $300 million dollars from this?!

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Wow, I wish hostile foreign forces would pay *me*\h
300 million dollars just to attend a protest.\h\h

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
I’ve been funded by hostile foreign forces\h
for years, and they’ve never given me a cent!

100
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,120
Now you’d think posts like this would not get\h
much traction online, because they’re too stupid.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,720
And yet, the provincial cyber police\h
just doubled down on the message.

102
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,840
They wrote, “The peace and tranquility of\h
the motherland today are not easy to come by.\h\h

103
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,880
Generations of revolutionary martyrs exchanged\h
their blood and lives for national independence,\h\h

104
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,480
and generations of Chinese sons and daughters\h
have used their youth and sweat to fight for\h\h

105
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,800
prosperity and strength. No one is allowed to\h
destroy it. We will never sit back and watch\h\h

106
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,640
the damage to national security and development\h
interests. We will never allow hostile forces\h\h

107
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,720
to undermine the security and stability of the\h
country and the peaceful life of the people.\h\h

108
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,240
We will never allow the color revolutions to\h
occur on this land. Anyone who wants to carry\h\h

109
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,040
out such a situation, try, you will be hit\h
head-on! #Vigilance Against Color Revolution”

110
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah, hashtag vigilance\h
against color revolution—which\h\h

111
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,160
no one was actually suggesting\h
was happening, except for you.

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,880
But if anyone knows how dangerous a revolution\h
can be, it’s China’s revolutionary martyrs\h\h

113
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,600
who exchanged their blood and\h
lives for national independence.

114
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from you,\h\h

115
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,240
a fan who supports the show through\h
the crowdfunding website, Patreon.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Lucien Furneaux says, “I am interested in knowing\h
more about 'gain of function' research and how the\h\h

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,680
CCP had been using it in regards to Covid 19,\h
and how they are continuing to implement it.”

118
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Good question, Lucien. The simple answer is,\h
the Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing\h\h

119
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,960
gain of function research on\h
coronaviruses before Covid-19 spread.\h\h

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
According to one of their funding\h
proposals, “gain of function”\h\h

121
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,280
meant scientists there were experimenting\h
to see if they could make coronaviruses\h\h

122
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,720
more contagious—and then use this knowledge\h
in the future to help *stop* global pandemics.

123
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,920
Hindsight, of course, is 2020.

124
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,800
Thanks for your question.

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,600
But speaking of, there’s more and more consensus\h
that the most likely origin of Covid-19\h\h

126
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,200
was an accidental lab leak from Wuhan. So if\h
you’d like us to do an episode about this,\h\h

127
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,040
leave your comments below, and we just might do\h
it for you. It will get demonetized by YouTube.\h\h

128
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
Which is why your support\h
on Patreon is so important.\h\h
