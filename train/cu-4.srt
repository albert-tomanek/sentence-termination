1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
The Chinese Communist Party\h

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,800
Is crushing Australia’s economy

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:15,920
Will Australia stand up to China?  Or back down?\h

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome back to China\h
Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,240
Have you ever wondered what the\h
world would be like if Twitter had\h\h

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,200
never been invented?\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
Perhaps President Hillary Clinton would be\h
preparing for her second term in office.\h

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,560
But that’s not the world we live in. Instead,\h\h

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,040
Twitter was invented. And it’s\h
become an important diplomatic tool.\h

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,400
And if you’re thinking that’s a\h
terrible idea, you would be right.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,560
Relations between China and Australia took another\h
hit on Monday (November 30), after Prime Minister\h\h

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,280
Scott Morrison demanded a fake image posted on a\h
Chinese official's Twitter account be taken down.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Morrison called a media briefing to condemn the\h
post which showed an Australian soldier holding\h\h

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,640
a knife to the throat of an Afghan child,\h
and said Canberra was seeking an apology\h\h

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
from Beijing.
\h\h

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
The Chinese Communist Party was probably\h
caught off guard by Morrison’s demands,\h\h

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
because the Communist Party is usually the one\h
that demands apologies from everyone else.\h

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,600
Which is why China responded that\h
it was sorry...that Australia sucks.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,040
This was the tweet in question, from Chinese\h
foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,400
This is not a real photo. It’s a photo\h
illustration created by a patriotic\h\h

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
Chinese artist whose work has been\h
boosted by Chinese state-run media.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,040
Both the tweet and the image are\h
about a recent independent report\h\h

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,720
commissioned by the Australian government. After\h
a four-year investigation, the report found that\h\h

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Australian special forces soldiers may have\h
committed up to 39 murders in Afghanistan.\h

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,120
Those 19 soldiers are now facing\h
investigation for their alleged war crimes.\h

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,280
This has been a huge scandal for Australia.\h
The government has pledged to appoint a special\h\h

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,400
investigator to prosecute the cases and\h\h

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,040
an independent oversight panel to make\h
sure the government implements changes.\h

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,960
Australia has also apologized to Afghanistan.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,360
But as far as the Chinese\h
Communist Party is concerned,\h\h

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
this is a great opportunity\h
to tear down Australia!\h

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,400
Zhao Lijian’s tweet is the latest example of\h
what’s being called “wolf warrior diplomacy.”\h\h

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
Named after the nationalistic\h
Wolf Warrior action movies.

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,840
Wolf Warrior diplomacy really began after Chinese\h
diplomats started joining Twitter. Of course.

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,640
Yes, Twitter has somehow managed\h
to make Chinese propaganda\h\h

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,600
worse. I didn’t think that was even possible.\h
But then again, twitter makes everything worse.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhao Lijian became the most famous wolf\h
warrior diplomat, after he tweeted back\h\h

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,760
in March that the US military could\h
have brought the coronavirus to China.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Which sparked a lot of media coverage.

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,240
Frankly, I don’t think we should call this wolf\h
warrior diplomacy. That makes it sound tough and\h\h

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,320
cool. These Chinese officials are just sending\h
aggressive tweets to get a rise out of people.\h

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,400
So let’s call it what it\h
is: Troll Face diplomacy.\h

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,840
Yes, Zhao Lijian and his fellow\h
diplomats are just internet trolls.\h

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
And like all internet trolls, they\h
love the attention they’re getting.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Now that the Chinese Communist Party has\h
triggered Australia, the Party is doubling down.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,840
But as hard as the Chinese Communist\h
Party is trying to pwn Australia,\h\h

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,680
the incident they’re mocking them for actually\h
shows a fundamental difference between\h\h

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
China’s authoritarian communist state\h
and Australia’s liberal democracy.

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
The Australian government started an independent\h
inquiry into the war crimes allegations.\h\h

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,160
The report was released publicly.\h
There will be further investigations,\h\h

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,840
and the individual soldiers involved, the\h
military, and the Australian government itself\h\h

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,400
will all face consequences for their\h
actions. And the public will know about it.

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,280
It’s a big contrast to how the\h
Chinese Communist Party treats,\h\h

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,440
for example, any criticism of their\h
suppression of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,920
But this incident is just the\h
latest in a long string of things\h\h

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,840
that have gone wrong between China and Australia.\h
I’ll tell you what those are after the break.

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,920
Welcome back. Relations between China\h
and Australia have been facing a\h\h

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,160
sharp downturn. And China, to no one’s\h
surprise, says it’s all Australia’s fault.

59
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,320
Obviously it’s because Australia just can’t\h
appreciate China’s goodwill because Australia\h\h

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,280
is so evil, according to my favorite\h
state-run media the Global Times.

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party has\h
so much goodwill towards Australia.\h\h

62
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Goodwill that they express through:

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
ramping up a huge trade conflict with Australia;

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
threatening Australian journalists;

65
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
and warning Australia over its\h
alliances with other countries.

66
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,760
How could Australia be so\h
ungrateful towards such goodwill?

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,680
China’s “goodwill” towards Australia started\h
earlier this year after Australia led calls\h\h

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
for an international investigation\h
into the origins of the coronavirus.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Which makes sense, since the Communist\h
Party is so touchy about the subject\h\h

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,400
that they’re still trying to insist\h
that the coronavirus came from Italy.

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Or maybe India.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
Definitely not from China.

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,920
But that coronavirus investigation is hardly\h
the only problem that China has with Australia.

74
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,040
In fact, last month, the Chinese embassy\h
gave Australian media a list of 14 reasons\h\h

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
why China is mad at Australia.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
Here’s the full list.

77
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,640
It includes everything from banning Huawei\h
and ZTE from Australia’s 5G networks,\h\h

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,320
to “incessant wanton interference in China’s\h
Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan affairs.”\h

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
It even includes things that the Australian\h
government isn’t directly responsible for,\h\h

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,960
like an Australian think tank publishing a\h
report on China’s use of Uyghurs as forced labor.

81
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,480
And negative news reports on\h
China from Australian media.\h

82
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,760
I mean, if the Chinese Communist Party has\h
complete control over China’s think tanks and\h\h

83
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,240
media, then the Australian government should\h
control their own think tanks and media, too.

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
But the real problem that the\h
Communist Party has with Australia\h\h

85
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,440
goes deeper than that. And I’ll tell you\h
about it after this commercial break.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Welcome back. The current conflict between\h
the Chinese Communist Party and Australia\h\h

87
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
actually goes back to 2017.\h
That’s when the Australian\h\h

88
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,800
government finally realized the extent of\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s infiltration\h\h

89
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,240
in Australian politics and society, and\h
they started to stand up for Australia.

90
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,520
Australia was the first Western liberal\h
democracy to expose the Chinese Communist\h\h

91
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Party’s influence operations. And that\h
was a huge problem for the Party.\h

92
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,680
And Australia made meaningful changes\h
to counter China’s interference,\h\h

93
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
including passing\h foreign interference laws.\h

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
Of course, that doesn’t mean that China’s\h
influence operations in Australia are over.\h\h

95
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
They are definitely still going on.

96
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,640
And we’ve talked about those a lot on this show.\h\h

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,440
We even traveled to Australia\h
back in 2018 to cover the issue.\h

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,320
But Australia’s actions over the years\h
have had a huge ripple effect. It started\h\h

99
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,600
the conversation about China’s influence\h
operations in other liberal democracies.\h

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,240
And the Chinese Communist\h
Party cannot let that happen.\h\h

101
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,240
Australia has stood up to\h
the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,160
so the Party must crush Australia—or other\h
countries might start getting ideas, too.

103
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,800
And the main way that the Party can\h
crush Australia is economically.\h\h

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,440
By destroying their exports to China.

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,640
Like coal.

106
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,920
And wine.

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,560
And lobsters.

108
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,280
So once again Australia becomes a test case\h
for dealing with the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
Will they continue to stand up to China, or\h
will they back down in the face of pressure?

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,800
It’s not going to be easy.

111
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Especially when you have experts\h\h

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,320
warning that an all-out trade war with China\h
could cost Australia 6 percent of their GDP.

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,840
So wouldn’t it be a better idea for Australia\h
to repair its relationship with China?

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,320
They could make a friendly gesture, like\h
joining China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
What could go wrong?\h

116
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,600
Look, it will be hard for Australia to stand\h
up to the Chinese Communist Party on its own.\h\h

117
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
Which is why its allies should stand by them.\h

118
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,920
New Zealand is joining Australia\h
in denouncing China’s tweet.

119
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,160
And America is stepping up to the plate, too. Look\h
at this tweet from the National Security lCouncil.

120
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,160
“Australian wine will be featured at a White\h
House holiday reception this week. Pity vino\h\h

121
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,040
lovers in China who, due to Beijing’s\h
coercive tariffs on Aussie vintners,\h\h

122
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,920
will miss out. Hashtag Aussie\h
Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi!

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,480
Wow, I can’t believe I just read that out loud.\h
Good for America for supporting Australia.\h\h

124
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,880
Could we just do it...not on Twitter?

125
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,320
And now it’s time for me to answer a question\h
from one of you, a supporter of the show\h\h

126
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
on the crowdfunding website\h
Patreon. Roy E Fitts asks:

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,320
Hey Chris, new patron here. if Biden\h
does win the white house do you\h\h

128
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
think the news and proof about the organ\h
harvesting that's been getting attention\h\h

129
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
will be silenced and or discredited\h
by the Biden administration?

130
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
The reality is that the Biden Administration\h\h

131
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
wouldn’t have to actively silence or\h
discredit the organ harvesting issue.\h\h

132
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,640
All they would have to do is ignore it, the\h
same way that previous administrations have.

133
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
The Chinese Communist Party has been\h
harvesting organs from prisoners of\h\h

134
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,600
conscience for more than 20 years now.\h
And the evidence of that keeps growing.\h

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
But it’s much easier for governments,\h\h

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,040
and corporations, and people to ignore\h
that evidence. Because if it were true,\h\h

137
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,640
then we couldn’t treat China like a normal country\h
that we should all be doing business with.\h\h

138
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,600
And based on our recent episode looking\h
at Biden’s foreign policy advisors and\h\h

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
their views on China, I wouldn’t hold my\h
breath for the Biden administration to\h\h

140
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,400
go around talking about organ harvesting\h
and why it should be stopped.\h

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,320
Roy, thanks for your question. Your\h\h

142
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
extremely depressing question. And thank\h
you for being a new patron of the show.
