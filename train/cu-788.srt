00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,100
China's growing interest

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,200
in “green” energy:

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,730
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,060
Bad news, everyone!

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,699
“Our world is in peril.”

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,340
That’s right.

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,439
Air pollution,

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,660
greenhouse gases,

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,020
fidget spinners—

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,280
the world is out of control, people!

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,210
Our planet,

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,050
voiced by Whoopi Goldberg,

15
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,600
is dying!

16
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,000
And now that President Donald Trump

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,060
has withdrawn the US

18
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,690
from the Paris climate agreement,

19
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,200
who can the world turn to for help?

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,280
One moment.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,920
Moving on.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,050
It's true that many are now looking to China

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,191
to be a global leader

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,730
when it comes to climate change.

25
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,260
Even some US politicians

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,210
plan to team up with China.

27
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,960
Like California Governor Jerry Brown,

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,730
who recently meet with Chinese officials

29
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,440
and green energy companies in Beijing.

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,810
"California is all in,

31
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,930
100 percent in meeting

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,940
the Paris Agreement—

33
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,450
in fact, going beyond.

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,040
We only make,

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
we only do that

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,620
if we are going to work with China,

37
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,800
Chinese provinces

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,030
to get the job done."

39
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,280
Yes, the Chinese government

40
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,770
has pledged to combat pollution.

41
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,220
China’s premier Li Keqiang has even promised

42
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,920
the return of blue skies.

43
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,930
Li also pledged

44
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,000
that upon the blue sky's return,

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that he would ask it

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to please tell us why

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,640
it had to hide away for so long,

48
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
so long,

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,020
where did we go wrong?

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,620
I didn’t realize Premier Li

51
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,120
was such a big E.L.O. fan.

52
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,420
But love is like oxygen.

53
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,420
You get too much,

54
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,430
you get too high.

55
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,430
Not enough…

56
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,560
then you’re probably living in Beijing.

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,690
So does this mean China is poised to become

58
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,240
a world leader in combating climate change?

59
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,980
Well, it turns out,

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,350
being a world leader in combating climate
change

61
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,580
is easier said than done.

62
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,180
Especially when parts of your country

63
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,100
look like a permanent Instagram filter.

64
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,129
I think this one's called

65
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,900
“Terracotta Worrier.”

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,300
Even though some Western media

67
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,720
and elected officials might be saying

68
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:17,830
China should replace the US on climate change,

69
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,560
that doesn’t mean the Chinese regime

70
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,939
is too keen on that.

71
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,549
According to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

72
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,120
“Taking on global leadership

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,820
is too much, too soon for China.”

74
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,380
Here’s an example.

75
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,800
A recent inspection in one region of China

76
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,489
showed that a shocking 70% of companies there

77
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,600
were violating pollution regulations.

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
It’s a bit of a hiccup.

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,780
Or a gasping,

80
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,040
sputtering cough as it were.

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,310
Over the course of several months,

82
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,320
the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection

83
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,959
investigated some of China’s

84
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,310
most polluted cities

85
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,390
in the mega urban sprawl of Jing-jin-ji,

86
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,029
a combination of Hebei,

87
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,300
Beijing, and Tianjin.

88
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Jing-Jin-ji.

89
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,660
It just rolls off the tongue.

90
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,380
Anyway, the ministry looked at

91
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,799
a variety of industries

92
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,049
and found that 14,000 out of 20,000 companies

93
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,579
were producing more emissions

94
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,579
than allowed,

95
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,730
or operating without pollution-control equipment.

96
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,980
But just because inspections

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,379
showed there was a problem

98
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,599
doesn’t mean the Chinese Communist Party

99
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,459
is going to effectively stop the problem.

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,640
Look, Chinese leaders

101
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,959
would love to have less pollution.

102
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,959
After all,

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,879
it literally makes China look bad.

104
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,309
I think this filter's called "Cobalt Monoxide."

105
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,320
But it’s complicated.

106
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,320
The Chinese economy

107
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,569
is heavily dependent on manufacturing,

108
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,609
which creates tons of pollution.

109
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:34,609
And the Party isn’t willing

110
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,159
to sacrifice China’s economy

111
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,969
to save the planet.

112
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,450
The promise of economic prosperity

113
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,719
is the main thing keeping the Communist Party

114
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,319
in power right now.

115
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,870
But pollution is also a potential threat

116
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,900
to the Party’s power.

117
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Pollution is one of the few issues

118
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,700
the Chinese mainstream middle class will protest.

119
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
En masse,

120
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,719
like this one in Jiangsu

121
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,790
back in 2012.

122
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,780
And in Dalian,

123
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,400
after tens of thousands of white collar workers

124
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,719
protested in 2011,

125
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,739
they successfully forced

126
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,809
a chemical plant to relocate.

127
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:06,889
Anti-pollution protests

128
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,669
are one of the only kinds of protest

129
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,769
that can have an effect in China.

130
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:11,989
And that's because these protests

131
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,519
are generally directed at local companies

132
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,239
or local government officials—

133
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,970
and not at the Party Central.

134
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,900
At least, for the time being.

135
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,760
You see, the Chinese Communist Party

136
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,980
has set up a system

137
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,300
where the central government

138
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,930
solves pollution problems

139
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,310
by issuing guidelines and targets

140
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,270
and then leaves it up to local officials

141
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,520
to implement the guidelines

142
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,260
and reach the targets.

143
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,280
On one hand,

144
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,280
this enables the Party

145
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,539
to blame local officials

146
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,789
when things go wrong.

147
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,460
But on the other hand,

148
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,450
this system is not necessarily effective

149
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,800
when dealing with pollution.

150
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,490
Because local officials don’t always

151
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,139
come up with pollution solutions

152
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,950
that are...not stupid.

153
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,620
Like how, to keep skies blue,

154
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,419
local officials in Beijing

155
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,040
banned outdoor barbecuing.

156
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,449
Repeatedly.

157
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,449
And in Xi’an,

158
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,150
officials just stuffed cotton gauze

159
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,879
into the air monitoring equipment.

160
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,030
Hey, the numbers don't lie.

161
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,320
Except they really, really do.

162
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,889
And in this lovely city in China’s Hebei

163
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:09,880
province,

164
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,599
villagers protested against a chemical plant

165
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,470
they alleged was giving them cancer.

166
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,909
So officials had a great solution.

167
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,180
"They blocked the doors to our village houses

168
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,880
to stop us going out and blocking the road.

169
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,979
Some would take you away,

170
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,180
some would beat you,

171
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
some hit you so badly

172
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,240
you'd end up in hospital."

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
As you can see,

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,630
Chinese officials really beat the problem.

175
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,270
What’s that, Shelley?

176
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,420
OK, too soon.

177
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,580
But China is changing, you say!

178
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,090
They’re investing billions of dollars

179
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,800
in renewable energy.

180
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,320
That’s true.

181
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,629
But there are still many state-owned enterprises

182
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,530
in the power, steel, and cement sectors

183
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,580
that rely on coal.

184
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,020
And they have tremendous power

185
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,150
to block limits on coal emissions

186
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,520
that could hurt their bottom line.

187
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,980
According to the US Energy Information Administration,

188
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,560
China burns almost as much coal

189
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,880
as the rest of the world combined.

190
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,060
This was Beijing at the end of last year.

191
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,420
I think they're calling this filter,

192
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,120
“Orange Is the New Blue.”

193
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,380
But, according to the Paris Agreement

194
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:10,979
that China just signed,

195
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,280
all that’s going to change.

196
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Just kidding.

197
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,700
It allows China to actually increase emissions

198
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,710
until 2030.

199
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,830
But don’t worry,

200
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,389
that’s when the Chinese regime promises

201
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,200
CO2 emissions will peak.

202
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,960
“I’m totally going to quit smoking,

203
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,900
Just gimme, like,

204
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,080
twelve more years.”

205
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,400
Now to be fair,

206
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,210
over the past two years,

207
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,530
China has stopped the construction

208
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,270
of 103 new coal power plants.

209
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,740
And over the past several years,

210
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,430
coal consumption has already been decreasing.

211
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,050
But according to this article,

212
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,840
that’s “largely because of slowing economic
growth.”

213
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,900
And while the Chinese regime canceled construction

214
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,440
of a bunch of coal plants,

215
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,080
there are “46 coal-to-chemical plants in operation,

216
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,880
and another 22 under construction.”

217
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,380
But there's still plenty of time

218
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,400
for China to actually meet its targets

219
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,949
from the Paris Agreement.

220
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,090
As long as local officials

221
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,260
have a steady supply of cotton gauze.

222
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,100
And on top of that,

223
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,740
China is also helping other countries pollute—

224
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,430
through its One Belt, One Road project.

225
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,969
Basically, China is helping developing nations

226
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,639
build coal-fired power plants.

227
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,700
According to National Geographic,

228
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,249
a state-owned Chinese company

229
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,669
is currently building a $2 billion

230
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,810
coal power plant in Kenya.

231
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,040
And in Africa overall,

232
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,389
more than 100 new coal plants

233
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,499
are in development,

234
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,200
and about half are being funded by China.

235
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,000
This is not to say Chinese officials

236
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:38,120
don’t care about pollution.

237
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,750
Many of them genuinely do.

238
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,439
It’s just that this kind of green

239
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,509
always comes first.

240
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:45,500
So what do you think of

241
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,039
China’s ability to fight pollution?
