1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,600
Hong Kong is under attack!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,170
The Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,450
is imposing its tyranny on the city

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,320
But the resistance is on the rise

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,900
This 
is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,279
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,900
Can music change the world?

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,860
Who knows?

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,480
But it might be able to at least change Hong
Kong.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,900
That’s what Denise Ho hopes.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,520
She’s is one of the biggest pop stars in
Hong Kong.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,700
She also had a huge following in Mainland
China.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,210
But she put all that at risk

14
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,890
by joining the 2014 Umbrella Movement,

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,980
a student led movement

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,180
to bring democracy to Hong Kong.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,620
The movement was not well received by those
in power.

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,480
For resisting Beijing’s pressure,

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,770
Denise Ho found herself on the wrong side
of the law.

20
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,510
And then the Chinese Communist Party

21
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,570
canceled her tours in China,

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,700
and blocked her social media accounts.

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,640
But that hasn’t stopped her

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,780
from standing up for human rights.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,100
I sat down with Denise Ho at the Oslo Freedom
Forum

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,560
to talk about the future of Hong Kong.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,180
Thanks for joining me today Denise.

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,180
Thank you!

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,180
Thank you.

30
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,820
So recently two people from Hong Kong

31
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,229
have come out to say that they got asylum
in Germany.

32
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:14,389
How does it feel to have Hong Kong be a place

33
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:16,960
that people get asylum from now?

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,659
Well, you know, it's pretty ironic

35
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:28,740
because right now we are in faced of this
extradition law.

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Yeah.

37
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,799
That is, you know, that Hong Kong government

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,350
is trying to impose on us.

39
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,350
But next week, actually,

40
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,669
we will be having a very big protest in Hong
Kong.

41
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:48,119
So, you know, we are fighting still

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,509
after five years from the Umbrella Movement

43
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,819
even though it's a pretty dim situation right
now in Hong Kong

44
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,939
since we try to shout out our opinions

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,779
but the Hong Kong government is just not listening.

46
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:10,290
Do you think it's possible to get a fair trial
in Hong Kong now?

47
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,750
I mean there's been legislators

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,360
that who have been kicked out of office,

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,010
Umbrella Movement leaders who have been arrested
and detained.

50
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,830
Is the court still free?

51
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,970
Well it really depends, you know,

52
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,850
which judge you get.

53
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,850
Okay.

54
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,330
Well that is my opinion.

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,110
If you are lucky, fortunate enough,

56
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,290
then you might get a judge that is unbiased,

57
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,110
and then he or she would look at the facts.

58
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,970
But from my point of view I think that some
of the trials

59
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,350
that went on during these five years were
quite biased.

60
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,850
Say for the Mong Kok Fishball Revolution,

61
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,850
you heard of it?

62
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,600
I have, why don't you say it for the audience?

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,430
For the Mong Kok Fishball Revolution

64
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,170
there were students and young generations

65
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,380
who were sentenced for up to seven or eight
years.

66
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,920
So, I mean, they probably had to be prosecuted

67
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,160
for the hassle that happened that night.

68
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,310
But is it fair to have such a heavy sentence?

69
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,090
We compare it a lot to what happened in 1967

70
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,030
when there was a revolution back then

71
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,850
with homemade bombs and all that,

72
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,840
and even back then the sentences

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,370
were not as strong as it is now.

74
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,880
And just recently the Umbrella Nine,

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,030
the activists who were involved in the Umbrella
Movement,

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,990
they were prosecuted and also sentenced for
a lesser sentence,

77
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:12,209
but still they were sentenced for half a year
or so.

78
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,281
But the fact is the Umbrella Movement

79
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:17,910
was not really started because of them,

80
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,049
they were just put on to the stage

81
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,810
just for intimidating the Hong Kong people

82
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,379
so that we won't get into another revolution

83
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,280
like the Umbrella Movement.

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,360
I know were Cantopop singers who openly came
out

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,610
in support of the Umbrella Movement,

86
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,410
and at the time the South China Morning Post

87
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,360
said that was career suicide.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,849
So what made you do that?

89
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,131
Well it was really the, you know, the picture...

90
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:50,870
It was the moment when I saw the police the
87 tear gas bombs

91
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,270
onto the peaceful protesters that, you know,

92
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,500
I was just so angry at that moment.

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,849
It might seem not much for other places

94
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,930
where you get tear gas bombed all the time,

95
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,490
but for Hong Kong we never saw

96
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,449
such a harsh reaction from the government.

97
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,110
And the fact that the people who were on the
streets,

98
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,660
you know they were just every day, normal
people.

99
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,020
They had nothing, they had no weapons whatsoever,

100
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,999
and for the police to react in such a way,

101
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,309
it was so...

102
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:37,189
We got so angry and we were so frustrated

103
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,500
and the emotions that came out that day.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,759
And on that moment I decided just I don't
care anymore

105
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,639
about repercussions that might come if I spoke
out.

106
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,499
So was it career suicide?

107
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:58,360
Half, half.

108
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,219
Half, half.

109
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,080
Half suicide.

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,719
Half suicide on the glamorous and extravagant
side

111
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:13,659
where I would get commercials and, you know,

112
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,360
the easy revenue that came from China.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
That was totally cut off.

114
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,009
Yeah, you couldn't tour as much in China or
at all.

115
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,669
I can not even get into China.

116
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,860
I was banned totally,

117
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,740
and I was labeled "Hong Kong poison."

118
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,789
That's right.

119
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,240
But on the other hand,

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,099
I started my revolution of my own in the entertainment
business.

121
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,199
And in 2016,

122
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,500
when I was supposed to have a concert in the
Hong Kong Coliseum,

123
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,599
the biggest venue in Hong Kong.

124
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,740
And normally you would have sponsors backing
you up,

125
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,589
buying some of the tickets,

126
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,289
and I got none of that,

127
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,300
so what I did was I started a campaign

128
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,539
to crowd sponsor the concert.

129
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,159
And I broke up, you know,

130
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,919
like if normally the sponsorships

131
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,069
would be one million Hong Kong dollars,

132
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,039
then I broke it up into super small pieces

133
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,529
and I offered it to local businesses.

134
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:27,969
And in the end we got 300 local businesses
who backed us,

135
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:32,139
and also 50,000 sold out in hours.

136
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,400
That's incredible.

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,630
I almost wish more western businesses would
hear that,

138
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,830
so they might think twice about

139
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,869
"oh there are options beside just [crosstalk]”

140
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,419
Yeah there are, there are actually.

141
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,979
You know, well on the other hand

142
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,099
is because I have a strong fan base,

143
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,909
so I was pretty confident that

144
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,839
even when I'm banned from China

145
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,599
they would be supporting me.

146
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,309
But the key is you have to,

147
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,229
you have to be really flexible.

148
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,900
You can not ride on the old ways,

149
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,270
and you know you have to play a completely
different game

150
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,629
from what the traditional music scene is doing.

151
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,270
Well considering the levels of influence

152
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,069
the Chinese Communist Party is having in Hong
Kong,

153
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,449
have you ever considered singing mainly in
Mandarin anymore?

154
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,520
Well I did release two Mandarin albums,

155
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,289
but that was mainly for Taiwan,

156
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,949
you know the Taiwan market.

157
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,729
And also before the Umbrella Movement I was
touring in China.

158
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,320
I had this theater piece called,

159
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,710
what was it called?

160
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,940
And it was based-

161
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,060
Wait, the Dream of Black Mansions, Red Mansions?

162
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,310
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,740
And so I toured for three years in different
cities of China,

164
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,860
and I actually gathered quite a number of
fans

165
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,670
during the pre-Umbrella Movement years.

166
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:08,200
So the thing that I feel is a shame is that

167
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,780
I can not reach these fans as much right now,

168
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,920
but they get through, you know,

169
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,210
they find ways to get in touch with me.

170
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,210
Oh.

171
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,210
Yeah!

172
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,529
They have the VPNs in China,

173
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,529
and they just use that.

174
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,040
And, you know, you see all these comments

175
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,180
on Instagram, Facebook, and they are the support
from China,

176
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,620
but also at the same time the...

177
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,190
We call them the 50 Cents, like those who-

178
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,370
On China Uncensored we know all about the
50 Cent Army.

179
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,410
But it's quite ironic because they have to

180
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,920
get through the wall to come [crosstalk]

181
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,990
On the platforms banned in China to criticize
you.

182
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,020
Yes that is funny [crosstalk]

183
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,780
Well to criticize "Hong Kong poison," you
know, it's worth it.

184
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,960
So I know your family originally fled China
to Hong Kong

185
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,330
to escape the Chinese Communist Party

186
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,030
and when it got close to the handover

187
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,020
they went to Quebec, right?

188
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Yes.

189
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,710
Why did you go back to Hong Kong?

190
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,360
Well this is something that my dad always...

191
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,090
you know, he's on me all the time

192
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,650
because they used up a sum of money for us

193
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,730
to get away from Hong Kong,

194
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,420
and then I was the reason that now

195
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,940
everyone is back in Hong Kong because of me.

196
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,030
But the reason why I decided to go back to
Hong Kong

197
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,990
was my attachment to the Cantonese,

198
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,000
the Cantopop, music scene as my childhood,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,870
teenage idol was the Cantopop diva, Anita
Mui.

200
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,160
And so in 1996,

201
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,360
I decided to get back to Hong Kong

202
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,850
to do the contest that she did 15 years ago.

203
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,480
And by accident I won.

204
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,030
What do you mean by accident you won?

205
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,480
Well, you know, I was just a fan chasing my
idol

206
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,370
and I just wanted to get in touch with her,

207
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,970
try to get the glimpse of her.

208
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,680
But of course I really loved singing and performing,

209
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,940
but the main reason was because I wanted to
see my idol.

210
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,990
Yeah, but fate happened and I won,

211
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,710
and so I stayed in Hong Kong since 1997.

212
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,520
So I went back from 1997

213
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,650
and I started my music career since then.

214
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,790
How many years ago?

215
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,360
15? 20ish?

216
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,860
I know after the Umbrella Movement ended there

217
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,990
was sort of this idea that the young people
of Hong Kong

218
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,440
gave up or they were defeated, is that true?

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,900
In a way, yes, it was quite gloomy and difficult,

220
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,770
very difficult five years.

221
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,310
I mean at first...

222
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,690
I think the first two years people were still
fighting,

223
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,750
like people got really angry and frustrated,

224
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,250
and so there were different ways, you know?

225
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,340
Some people got very violent,

226
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,600
and well violent in the Hong Kong way.

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,200
And, you know, they were quite heavily criticized

228
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,330
by the pro-Beijing parties, which you know
they...

229
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,400
And they used that as a tool to-

230
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,460
To everyone.

231
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,600
Yes, yes.

232
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,630
And so that was when the prosecution

233
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,340
and the political reprisal happened.

234
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,740
And all those names that were detained

235
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,670
and arrested during the Umbrella Movement

236
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,670
some of them were jailed

237
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,120
and some of them were sentenced to different
periods of time.

238
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:22,100
And these two years it's been quite depressing,

239
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,670
depressing time for the Hong Kong people

240
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,410
and especially the younger generations.

241
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,930
I have friends with families

242
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,680
who chose to leave once again the city

243
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,110
like when my family did [crosstalk] in the
80s.

244
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,730
And most of them are young families with young
children.

245
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,130
I could understand, you know,

246
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,930
I could relate to them because if I had children
right now,

247
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,470
I would be quite worried about what education

248
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:07,580
they would be getting from the communist Hong
Kong government.

249
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,280
There are much lesser discussion about

250
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,070
what people should do in these times

251
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,470
because in a way we have tried a lot of things

252
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,970
and it just didn't work

253
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,610
because we don't have the democracy system

254
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,160
that we wish we had.

255
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,540
And so the Hong Kong government they just...

256
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,500
they just do what they want, they just...

257
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,760
they are not listening,

258
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:42,140
and they are passing laws quite unjustifiably,

259
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,840
and they're changing laws

260
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,050
in favor of the Beijing government.

261
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,940
Well with the new extradition law

262
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,600
has that changed how people feel?

263
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,460
Because I know there was another big protest

264
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,440
that happened because of that.

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Yes.

266
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
In a way yes.

267
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,010
The discussions are warming up now,

268
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:07,550
and personally I hope that after these different
periods

269
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,210
of frustration, disappointment

270
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,660
that people would come to realize

271
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,990
that this is a very long war.

272
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,440
This is a very long battle that can not be
won,

273
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,020
a very long battle that can not be won

274
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,030
just within one or two years.

275
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,420
It's a very difficult process

276
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,980
and I think Hong Kong people are learning,

277
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:41,630
and we are a population that is educated

278
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,430
to be quick and instantaneous.

279
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,680
So the sought and notion of patience we

280
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,970
are just not very much accustomed to that.

281
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,300
So we are learning to be more patient

282
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,330
and to work our way through these very difficult
issues.

283
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,430
And just a few weeks ago we had

284
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,750
the first protest for the extradition law,

285
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,090
and since the Umbrella movement that was

286
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:26,260
the first time that the number of people surpassed
100,000,

287
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,900
and you know that is encouraging for those

288
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,440
who had been still working hard at it.

289
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,970
And so hopefully the next protest on the ninth
of June

290
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,850
would gather more people,

291
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,710
and even though we know a protest

292
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,790
might not change a lot of things,

293
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:56,360
but personally I think it is a form of unity
and where,

294
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,680
you know, people can see each other

295
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,470
and then we can get back into that notion
of

296
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,030
"we are not alone."

297
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,560
And we are, we are still here, we are still
numbered.

298
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,030
And something can still be done.

299
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,290
What kind of support for Hong Kong

300
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,670
would you like to see in the international
community?

301
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,730
Well, you know, as someone who has been

302
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,480
banned and rejected by global brands,

303
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
I think there is power in international unity.

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,680
Because what we see is

305
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,370
people are afraid of losing the China market,

306
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,330
so brands and businesses they choose to not
speak out

307
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,390
and they choose to stand on the side of money.

308
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,850
So I think that if the international market...

309
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,780
they realize that there are other choices.

310
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,930
I don't mean we have to ignore the China market

311
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,690
that is just part of the international market.

312
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,380
And so when people realize that that is not
the only choice

313
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,220
and we have more important values

314
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,930
and things that we should focus on,

315
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,970
I think that might gradually be a force

316
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,410
that we could rely on each other to gain back

317
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:38,310
some of the values and the virtues are so
important to us.

318
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,990
So where do you see Hong Kong in 2047?

319
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,960
In 2047?

320
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
That is-

321
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
That's the big year?

322
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:55,620
Yeah, that is something that I really have
no answer for.

323
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,520
I know what the reality is,

324
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,430
but at the same time I am still optimistic,

325
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,780
in a way that even the tyrants,

326
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,650
the big machines,

327
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,809
there are people behind it.

328
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,590
And so in a way people make mistakes,

329
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,480
and people make decisions that dry things
in various ways.

330
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,830
So now how many years we have?

331
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,050
20ish?

332
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,380
I can't do that math.

333
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Yeah.

334
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,900
And so a lot could happen in this period of
time

335
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,900
and I try to stay not positive but optimistic.

336
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:47,490
And I mean we have to keep this optimism.

337
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,670
We have to keep this sought that we can make
a change

338
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,910
even though it might be baby steps,

339
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:01,740
but I think the power is really within the
people

340
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,100
and if we do not give up then who knows

341
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,310
maybe something would change along the way.

342
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,440
Well I think that's a great note to end this
interview on.

343
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,680
Thank you so much for joining us.

344
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Thank you, yeah.

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,400
And keep up the good work in Hong Kong.

346
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,780
Okay, thank you.
