00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,900
On this episode of China Uncensored, to arms,
my 50-cent army! To arms!

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:12,950
Hi welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host
Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,900
Mothers in law.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,800
Often a punch line in and of themselves.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Except when they get kidnapped.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,190
Some of you may know my friend and fellow
YouTube celebrity Ben Hedges.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,030
He's the host of Laowai Kan Zhongguo.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,390
And this is Ben's mother in law, Sheng Xiaoyun.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,690
And this is Ben's mother in law's house—after
it was ransacked by Chinese police.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,079
...which looks roughly like my old house in
the Bronx after it was ransacked by a drug-crazed

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,850
lunatic.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,260
And before ransacking her home, police went
to the elementary school where she works,

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,680
and kidnapped her.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,739
That must have been fun for the kids.

15
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:58,060
So it turns out, Xiaoyun committed what the
Chinese regime considers the one of the most

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,960
heinous crimes imaginable: Filing a legal
complaint.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,659
And while you may think that being a former
elementary school teacher already makes Xiaoyun

18
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,780
a scourge on society, there's one other thing
you should know.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,770
She practices meditation—Falun Gong, which
is based on the principles of truth, compassion,

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,990
and tolerance.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,109
And in China, believing in those principles
is dangerous.

22
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:29,030
Because in 1999, Chinese leader Jiang Zemin
decided to eradicate anyone who practiced

23
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,249
Falun Gong.

24
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:36,450
So he created the world's biggest internal
security force, and used it to kill them.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,189
But since current Chinese leader Xi Jinping
came to power in 2012, he's been waging war

26
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:48,249
on the Jiang Zemin political faction that
used its genocide of Falun Gong to grab power.

27
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:53,279
In the past few years, Xi has arrested and
purged hundreds of Jiang's men under a so

28
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,729
called "anti-corruption campaign." That includes
some of the highest ranking members of the

29
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,049
Communist Party.

30
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,359
I guess many Falun Gong practitioners in China
felt then that this might be a good time to

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,649
file complaints against Jiang Zemin.

32
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,760
You know, for all the torture and genocide.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,379
And technically in China, there's a mechanism
for doing that.

34
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,959
You file a complaint with the Supreme People's
Court and the Procuratorate.

35
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,879
So Xiaoyun, having been harassed multiple
times by China's internal security police,

36
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,750
including being tortured in a labor camp for
a year, decided it was within her legal right

37
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,319
to file a complaint of her own.

38
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,099
In fact, since June this year, Chinese people
have filed well over a hundred and fifty thousand

39
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,430
complaints against Jiang Zemin.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,060
And some of them have then been abducted or
harassed by police.

41
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,709
Now before you say, "Well, what did you expect?"

42
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,170
First of all, blaming the victim allows this
type of genocide to happen.

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,290
But more important, the legal complaints against
Jiang are both legitimate and have legal standing.

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,980
And how the China government handles them
deals with the fundamental issue of whether

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,030
or not China can have rule of law.

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,489
If Chinese people are arrested for exercising
the rights supposedly guaranteed by the Chinese

47
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,939
constitution—such as filing a legal complaint—how
can you expect the Chinese regime to follow

48
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,540
laws about intellectual property theft?

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,629
International trade?

50
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:22,709
Cyber espionage?

51
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,069
The South China Sea?

52
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:31,739
But even more important, this is a chance
for you to do something, while at the same

53
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,230
time, getting to harass one of the jerks who
makes life miserable for ordinary Chinese

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,189
citizens.

55
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:41,390
Xiaoyun was detained by police from this Chinese
police station.

56
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,890
And this is the actual name and phone number
for the police chief responsible for her arrest.

57
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,219
So get your phones out, my precious 50-cent
army, and give Police Chief Yu Changjun a

58
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:53,560
call...

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,749
...and tell him to release Sheng Xiaoyun.

60
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,030
This number is also in the description below.

61
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,200
Obviously, you'll have better luck communicating
with him if you speak Mandarin.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,439
You know, before he hangs up on you.

63
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,299
I'm not kidding, by the way.

64
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,889
Actually call this number.

65
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,219
And then send me an email with the subject
line "I Called the Police" and tell me what

66
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,810
happened on the call.

67
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,959
My goal is to have 500 viewers call this number.

68
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,720
I think that'll be enough to give him the
message that it's not ok to arrest your citizens

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,650
for filing a complaint.

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,640
Let's help rescue my friend Ben's mother in
law.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:05:02,390
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
