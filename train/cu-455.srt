00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,140
the war between China and Taiwan!

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,020
Hi and welcome to China—it’s right over
there!

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,280
I’m standing on the island of Jinmen,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,369
just off the coast of China’s Fujian province.

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:19,179
Yes, that’s Jinmen with a “K”.

7
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,010
Some people also call it Kinmen.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,960
Oh, and in the old-timey days,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,529
people called it Quemoy.

10
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,769
Just like Taiwan used to be called Formosa.

11
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,650
Or like text messages used to be called

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,029
“Oh my gosh, just call your mother!”

13
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,940
But even though the People’s Republic of
China,

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,620
the PRC, is just a few miles across the water,

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,670
this island is part of the Republic of China,

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,670
the ROC.

17
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,670
Aka Taiwan.

18
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,140
Aka Formosa.

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,400
Aka your mom.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,900
Wait.

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,840
I know what you're thinking,

22
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,929
how can a little part of Taiwan be so close
to mainland China?

23
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,140
why hasn’t the Chinese army invaded already?

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,519
Well, they tried.

25
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,519
Like three times.

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,720
They just...weren’t very good at invading.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,510
First, in 1949, the ROC’s forces—

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,190
called the Nationalists—

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,140
fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil
war to the communists.

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,200
Then the communist forces tried to capture
Jinmen

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,460
as a first step toward invading Taiwan.

32
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,360
But they didn’t expect the Nationalists
to be prepared for them.

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,640
Also they didn’t bring enough food.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
So the Communists...didn’t win.

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,100
Then between 1954-1955,

36
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,660
the Communist Party’s army shelled Jinmen

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,810
to test if the United States would really
back the Nationalists.

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,479
“Chinese Nationalist soldiers spring into
action

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,000
on shell-torn Quemoy island

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
as a warning alert sends frightened children

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,770
and their parents scurrying for shelter,

42
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,420
wondering if this is the long-threatened communist
attack

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,320
on their beleaguered outpost.

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,180
Barely five miles from the mainland,

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,520
Chiang Kai-shek’s troops are ever-alert,

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,170
pledged never to surrender Quemoy.

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,580
Coastal batteries are ready to bark death
to the communists,

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,980
plotting their evil schemes across the sullen
sea.”

49
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,840
Not only did the US help,

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,119
they considered dropping a nuke on China.

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,380
Wait, forget the nuclear bombs for a minute.

52
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,820
Let’s go back to that newsreel.

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,500
“Plotting their evil schemes across the
sullen sea?”

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,420
That’s amazing.

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,470
Why don’t reporters talk like that anymore?

56
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,470
Really?

57
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,900
That’s what you got from that?

58
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,460
No.

59
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,460
Carry on.

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Anyway, only three years later,

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,660
the PRC tried to invade Kinmen again.

62
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,620
“Suddenly the Chinese Nationalist offshore
island of Quemoy

63
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,620
has become the red-hot target for communist
artillery.”

64
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,400
On August 23, 1958,

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,480
the PRC started bombarding Kinmen,

66
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,440
which became known as the 823 artillery battle.

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,830
In fact, they shelled Kinmen for 44 days.

68
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,980
And dropped 470,000 artillery shells over
the island.

69
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,379
The PRC and ROC also waged naval and air battles
over the island.

70
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,769
We spoke with Li Shi-sheng,

71
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,560
who was in the local militia defending Jinmen.

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,020
“In the militia,

73
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,320
we had to wear our own clothes and eat our
own food.

74
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,880
All to protect this land...

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,960
We didn’t even know where our next meal
would come from.

76
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,600
We were scared all the time.

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,000
We constantly had to hide.”

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,300
But the shelling continued.

79
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,880
For the next 20 years.

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,380
Only now,

81
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,900
the shells were filled with propaganda from
the dirty reds.

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,939
Chris, we’re not doing that.

83
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,170
Okay fine.

84
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,269
While Americans were watching Star Wars

85
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,640
and dancing to Saturday Night Fever,

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,520
the communist People’s Liberation Army was
still firing on Jimen

87
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,420
three or four times a week.

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,709
Some shells were full of propaganda leaflets.

89
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,580
Others were full of lead.

90
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,180
“When we heard the first shells hit,

91
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,220
we would go into the bomb shelters.

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,880
We would be able to tell where the shells
would hit

93
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,360
just from the sound.

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Whether the shells were from Xiamen or the
other islands,

95
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,020
we’d be able to tell where they were from

96
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,000
and where they would hit.”

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
That’s why locals built these

98
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,970
underground concrete tunnels and bunkers

99
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,390
that connect all the houses.

100
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,300
Even under this Qing-Dynasty era school.

101
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,170
And they also acquired all these weapons.

102
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,360
The Nationalists also built these underground
docks

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,830
called the Jhaishan tunnels—

104
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,830
so they could load and unload supply boats

105
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,550
out of the range of communist Chinese bombs.

106
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,540
The people of Jinmen also fought back.

107
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,850
By sending their own anti-communist propaganda

108
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,230
to the mainland.

109
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,320
Through loudspeakers that played

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,820
across to the mainland.

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,880
And other ways as well.

112
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,390
“The anti-Reds are experimenting

113
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,100
with other ways of getting their message across

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,850
the two miles of sea.

115
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,520
Under favorable conditions,

116
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,180
balloons carrying propaganda leaflets rise
to 40,000 feet,

117
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,070
and have been known to stay up 12 hours.”

118
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,740
But people also tried to carry on with their
lives.

119
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,600
One family actually found a pretty good use

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,760
for all those bomb shells.

121
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,440
“First we have to decide what kind of knife

122
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,580
to make from the bombshell,

123
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,520
then we cut a piece of the bombshell,

124
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,300
add heat, and shape it.

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,260
It needs to be cooled in oil and not water,

126
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,080
because of the grade of the steel.

127
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,660
Then we grind and sharpen the blade,

128
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,960
and then add the handle.

129
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,220
That’s how we make a knife.”

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,540
Now Jinmen looks like a sleepy rural island.

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,060
But For years,

132
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,280
it was on the front lines

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,700
of the battle between the communists and the
free world.

134
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,130
Communist China tried to bomb Jinmen into
submission,

135
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,130
but never did.

136
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,760
Now, they’re using money to do what bombs
couldn’t.

137
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,460
Today, tourists from Mainland China frequent

138
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,070
the once war torn island.

139
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,180
And, looking across at the more prosperous

140
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,810
Xiamen in mainland China,

141
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,300
many in Jinmen now want to get closer

142
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,310
to their former Communist adversaries.

143
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,120
There's even talk of building a bridge

144
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,280
between Jinmen and the mainland.

145
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,340
So what you’re saying is,

146
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,510
the Taiwan side stopped the propaganda war
too soon!

147
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,130
No...that’s not exactly what I was trying
to…

148
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,130
Don’t worry Shelley!

149
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,960
I’m on it.

150
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Come with me

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,220
America’s darling Chris Chappell,

152
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,760
star of many hit YouTubes,

153
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,150
plus his plucky sidekick Shelley Zhang,

154
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,020
has taken up the mantle battling the evil
communists

155
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,280
on the island of Quemoy with renewed vigor.

156
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Balloons carrying messages of freedom

157
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,560
will rain down upon the dirty reds and...

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,920
Chris, what are you doing?

159
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,310
I’m putting, you know,

160
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,760
messages of freedom in balloons.

161
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,920
It’s the 21st century.

162
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,980
Pieces of paper in balloons won’t help anyone.

163
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,760
You’re right!

164
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,440
I need to use modern technology.

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,760
Flash drives!

166
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,580
You know you also need to use helium.

167
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,220
Aww.
