00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,129
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,949
China’s great and glorious Photoshop fails.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,059
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,220
China has been photoshopping since before
it was cool.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,390
Before there was even photoshop actually.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,810
For example, why let a perfectly good historical
photo of Mao be ruined

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,810
just because this one guy later got purged
from the Party?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,320
Delete!

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,490
This happened a lot, actually.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,260
Back then they used airbrushing to, uh...

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,620
edit the historical record.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,100
Unfortunately, advances in technology

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,860
don’t necessarily make people better at
what they do.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,010
So here are 5 shocking examples of Chinese
photoshop fails.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,690
Number 5 Floating Officials

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,470
You know, Chinese officials are busy.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,780
They don’t have time to, you know,

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,670
visit places and do their jobs.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,050
That’s where Photoshop comes in.

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,720
Here are some such hard-working officials

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,110
inspecting a new highway in Sichuan.

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,670
Yeah, no one was fooled by that.

23
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,760
Netizens mocked the bad photoshop job

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,940
by showing that they have better skills than
the government.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,030
The Guardian called it

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,560
“one of the worst-doctored photographs in
internet history.”

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,030
But I’m guessing no one at the Guardian
saw these next four.

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,040
Number 4 Doctoring the elderly

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,820
The story is, these officials were supposed
to be visiting

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,430
the oldest woman in Ningguo city.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,409
Then the local government actually tried to
pass off this photo as real.

32
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,470
But like this official’s legs,

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,020
the government’s attempts to doctor the
photo are pretty transparent.

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,080
Why is this old woman so tiny?

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,760
How does anyone decide that this looks ok
to publish?

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,120
Eventually officials admitted the image was
doctored.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,159
Shocking!

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,940
That they admitted it, that is.

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,140
In an official statement,

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
they said the image was fake,

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,390
but they did really visit the old woman.

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,360
And other photos emerged showing that,

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,700
at least at some point,

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,950
they did.

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,690
So why the fake?

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,140
Well according to the statement,

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,740
the photographer wasn’t able to take a picture
that could

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,900
fit all the officials and the elderly woman.

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,050
I mean you know how hard it is

50
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,209
to take a photo of five people at the same
time?

51
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,290
So they had to fake it.

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,890
But that doesn’t explain why they had to
fake it so poorly…

53
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,819
Number 3 Copy and Paste Africans

54
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,940
A state-owned enterprise in Shandong province

55
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,160
wanted to commemorate the beginning of their

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,500
Angola Infrastructure Transformation Project.

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,130
But rather than hold some kind of actual ceremony
and take a picture of it,

58
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,099
they instead opted for the,

59
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,520
“Photoshop random Africans in front of their
company banner.”

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,040
Number 2 Parks and Re-creation

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,720
So you may have noticed that a major part

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,360
of being a local government official,

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,120
is going out an inspecting things!

64
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,500
And these guys may just be the perfect local government employees,

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,311
at least according to Ron Swanson,

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,520
He shows zero initiative.

67
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,020
He's not a team player.

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,959
He's never wanted to go that extra mile.

69
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,950
Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government
employee."

70
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,150
And this photoshop job is just as incompetent
as the government ought to be,

71
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,440
according to Ron.

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,260
I guess no one in the government noticed

73
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,680
that this guy’s whole body is as big as this
guy’s torso.

74
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,380
Which is also as big as a tree.

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,160
It’s about as good as my annual inspection
of

76
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,709
Hollywood,

77
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,810
New York,

78
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,910
Birthday Town,

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,990
and Space.

80
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,160
And finally number 1

81
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,300
Well hey, that’s not too bad actually.

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,590
It more or less looks like these officials
are actually there!

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,849
Oh.

84
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,879
These six officials in Shanxi are overseeing
the destruction of fake alcohol.

85
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,940
And it’s true!

86
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,629
That is definitely fake alcohol.

87
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,209
So what do you think of the Chinese government’s
Photoshop fails?

88
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,860
Do you think you could do better?

89
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,700
Prove it!

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,890
Download the photo in the Description below

91
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,030
and show me your Photoshop skills.

92
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,379
I’ll post the best ones on my Facebook page.

93
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,029
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

94
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,900
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time!
