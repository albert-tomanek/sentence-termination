00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:01,879
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,500
North Korea is threatening nuclear war,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,190
and Chinese hackers want to make sure

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,540
we’re not prepared to deal with it.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,270
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,760
Things on the Korean peninsula are heating
up.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,890
The US is sending in warships,

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,940
China is urging restraint,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,960
and North Korea promises destruction.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,160
Now that we possess mighty nuclear power

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,800
to protect ourselves from U.S. nuclear threat,

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,449
we will respond without the slightest hesitation

14
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:43,120
to full-out war with full-out war and to nuclear war

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,359
with our style of nuclear strike,

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,350
and we will emerge victor

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,000
in the final battle with the United States."

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,820
Well, to ensure North Korea does not

19
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,289
emerge as the victor,

20
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,309
the US installed THAAD in South Korea.

21
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,200
It stands for Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,750
It’s kind of important,

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,220
in the event North Korea ever tries

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,560
to make good on its promise

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,820
to turn South Korea’s capital into

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,909
“a sea of flames.”

27
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,180
But now THAAD is under threat.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,450
Not from North Korean missiles,

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,310
or shifting political winds,

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,670
or even public protests.

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,450
But from Chinese hackers.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,829
According to cybersecurity firm FireEye,

33
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,390
“Chinese state-backed hackers

34
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,979
have recently targeted South Korean entities

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,140
involved in deploying a U.S.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,270
missile-defense system.”

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,310
Remember: it's not just North Korea that doesn't like THAAD.

38
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,360
The Chinese regime doesn’t like it either.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,109
Even though THAAD is designed to stop

40
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,759
North Korean missiles,

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,539
it could in theory allow South Korea

42
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,250
and the US to track Chinese missiles.

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,799
So there are two main hacker groups

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,030
from China involved here.

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,789
One FireEye is calling the Tonto Group—

46
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,249
there must be some Lone Ranger fans over there.

47
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:02,069
The other is nicknamed APT10.

48
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,299
It's also sometimes called Stone Panda.

49
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,990
That one has also been accused of hacking

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,590
a US trade lobbying group,

51
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,650
and also of rolling down hills

52
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,540
and gathering no moss.

53
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,099
There are some independent Chinese hackers

54
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,299
targeting South Korea, too.

55
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,709
But both Tonto and Stone Panda

56
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,110
have been linked to Chinese military intelligence
units.

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,480
This is not to say that the Chinese Communist
Party

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,290
is behind the hacks in any way.

59
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,689
I mean, sure the Chinese military

60
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,040
belongs to the Party.

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,340
But China never messes with other countries!

62
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,189
“China always sticks to the principle of
not interfering

63
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,560
in the internal affairs of other countries.”

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,340
It’s just a coincidence

65
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,030
that since the South Korean government announced

66
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,670
the deployment of THAAD earlier this year,

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,670
hacking attacks from China have been on the
rise...

68
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,099
and that some of these hacks

69
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,569
have been targeting entities related directly

70
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,349
and indirectly to THAAD.

71
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,379
Last month,

72
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,040
South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs
website

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,689
was crippled.

74
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,819
This Korean news agency

75
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,870
said Chinese hackers have targeted,

76
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,909
“the homepages of 10 South Korean firms

77
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,590
and some South Korean embassies

78
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,720
in other countries”.

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,799
The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning

80
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,189
raised the country’s cyberattack alert level

81
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,159
to the second highest rating.

82
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,440
I guess the Future Planning division

83
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,459
didn’t see it coming.

84
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,810
And what has North Korea been doing

85
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,709
while the Chinese Communist Party has totally
not been

86
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,750
interfering in the internal affairs of South
Korea?

87
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,349
Well, they just held a massive rally

88
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,500
marking the 85th anniversary

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,799
of the North Korean army.

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,390
Even though Kim Jong-un wasn’t there,

91
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,900
don’t they still sound excited?

92
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,980
How do they all know when to say that?

93
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,640
I wonder what it would feel like to have

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,440
hundreds of people cheering your every word?

95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,080
Pretty good, actually.

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
I may keep that around.

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Anyway, where was the dear leader?

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,790
Why he was inspecting a pig farm.

99
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,129
They have lots of food in North Korea,

100
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,129
did you know?

101
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,879
Except I can’t seem to find Kim in this
picture.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,280
Just a bunch of giant hams.

103
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,500
That is never going to get old.

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,880
But not to worry.

105
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,350
Chinese hackers may be trying

106
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,820
to mess with THAAD,

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,380
but THAAD is merely a precautionary measure.

108
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,260
I mean, it's not like North Korea

109
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,190
is holding any live-fire artillery drills

110
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,280
while US warships gather, right?

111
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm sure everything will be fine.

112
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
So what do you think

113
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,970
of the Chinese regime’s cyber attacks

114
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,230
in retaliation for South Korea’s

115
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,970
missile defense program?

116
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,820
Was it a...THAAD idea?

117
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,900
Yep, definitely keeping that.

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
Leave your comments below.

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,790
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored,

120
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,580
once again I’m your host, Chris Chappell,

121
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
see you next time.
