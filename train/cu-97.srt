1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,669
China launched a war against the free world

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,990
While America turned a blind eye

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,690
Now China’s political warfare is everywhere

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,200
Is the battle lost?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Or can we still fight back?

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,060
This is China Uncensored,

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,280
I’m Chris Chappell, here in Taipei, Taiwan.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,580
When the Cold War ended,

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,680
the world breathed a collective sigh of relief.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,310
And completely forgot about the other massive
Communist power

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,580
threatening the world

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
—the Chinese Communist Party.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,380
Through a sophisticated use of what they call
political warfare,

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,000
the Chinese regime has slowly subverted democracies
around the world,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,469
including the United States and Taiwan.

16
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,520
I sat down with Chinese political warfare
expert

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,000
Professor Kerry Gershaneck

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,420
to learn how we all got trapped in China’s
Red Matrix.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,180
Thanks for joining me today.

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,199
Thanks Chris.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
Appreciate you having me here today.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,340
Absolutely.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,380
So you're an expert on Chinese commie's party
political warfare.

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,820
First, what is political warfare?

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,040
Political warfare from the people's Republic
of China perspective

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,960
is the number one way it is going to destroy
the democracy on Taiwan.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,260
It is the number one way it will usurp the
United States

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,630
as the leading global superpower,

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,040
the way it will bring down the hegemon,

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,200
and so it can become the hegemon.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,490
The goal of political warfare's to do all
that without fighting.

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,590
That is without going kinetic in a mid intensity

33
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,970
or high intensity conflict.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,110
You use political means, you use influence.

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,049
Malign influences a term that you'll hear
often.

36
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,730
But it's much more than simple malign influence.

37
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:54,640
It's all the means that a communist fascist
totalitarian regime,

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,720
based on Leninist terror,

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,289
as a means of executing your policies, state,
can use.

40
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,329
So I know a lot of terminology around political
warfare,

41
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,640
like gray zone operations, or comprehensive
coercion.

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,160
I think that's pretty confusing to a lot of
your average audience.

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,319
How would you explain it to like my mom?

44
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,830
You're absolutely right.

45
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,150
The lexicon, the terminology,

46
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,250
that surrounds what is in reality, this war
that we are in,

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,740
China is at war with us, and we don't understand
it

48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,230
because we don't understand the terminology.

49
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,270
We America, and Taiwan, the Republic of China,

50
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,810
all too often we think in terms of discrete
functions

51
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,940
such as diplomacy.

52
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,750
We think in terms of information operations,

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,080
we think in terms of psychological operations.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
There's a whole array of terminology.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,590
You've addressed the gray zone operations,

56
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,430
but there's proxy armies.

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,340
There's a whole array of terms

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,100
that gets stovepiped in our thinking.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,610
Our policy leaders,

60
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,090
our elected officials don't understand that
these aren't

61
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,480
just discreet functions from the PRC perspective.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,460
The PRC is waging war against us,

63
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,810
they're waging what we would call in

64
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,290
the military combined arms warfare.

65
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,540
They're using every asset they have.

66
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,220
Every component, the army, Navy, air force,

67
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,620
Marine special operations.

68
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Okay.

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,200
Apply that to political warfare.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
It's psychological operations, special measures.

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,450
Again, going back to their mentors.

72
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,230
This Chinese communist party mentors,

73
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,630
was originally Lenin and then Stalin, in the
Soviet union.

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,920
So it's the active measures or special measures,

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,420
that they use too, include assassination,
kidnapping, proxy armies,

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,520
violence, coercive efforts to influence

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,830
and to change the behavior of other countries,
of other groups,

78
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,650
of their own people to conform

79
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,000
with exactly what the CCP wants them to do.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,530
Our terminology frankly, is really undermining
our ability

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,301
to fight back effectively against the political
war

82
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,370
that's being waged against us.

83
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,250
Why is the Chinese communist party doing this?

84
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,460
I mean, why can't we just get along?

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,610
Excellent question that I know that you know
the answer to,

86
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,350
but for the benefit of your audiences worldwide,

87
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,850
who may not fully understand the issue.

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,490
No one cares if we're dealing with a quote
rising Canada.

89
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,290
No one cares if we're dealing with a rising
Brazil.

90
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,440
No one cares if we're dealing even with the
rising Republican-

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,000
I care about a rising Canada, I never trusted
them.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,020
You know as well you should, but again,

93
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,120
the maple leaf on that flag flying overhead,

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,410
that doesn't instill as much fear in me

95
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,031
as seeing the flag of the People's Republic
of China

96
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:47,420
flying over Taiwan or Washington DC and here's
why.

97
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,620
The country we're dealing with, the state,

98
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,040
every word here I'm going to say is important.

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,410
It is an increasingly militarily and economically
powerful,

100
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:06,060
hyper nationalistic, expansionist, fascist
totalitarian regime.

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,760
All the other countries, Canada included,
are democracies.

102
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,890
They're self correcting.

103
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,940
If the Republic of China next week decided

104
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,530
we're going to build a 550 ship Navy twice
the size of the US Navy,

105
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,530
guess what?

106
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,260
The regime that's in power would be out of
power

107
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,870
come next election because the people can
self correcting.

108
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,940
They're going to vote out people

109
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,500
that improperly utilize national assets,

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,650
national treasure to build militaries

111
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,580
that you don't need for peacetime defense.

112
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,580
People's Republic of China

113
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,520
isn't building a military for peace time defense.

114
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
They're using it for coercion.

115
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,490
They're using it for expansion.

116
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,100
Again, the nature of the regime counts

117
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,090
and this is what so many American academics

118
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,260
and a lot of policymakers, including foreign
policy

119
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,420
and foreign service officers and even a military
personnel.

120
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
Certainly a lot of professors.

121
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,460
I mean it's what they don't get.

122
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,760
We're not dealing with a benign country.

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,440
You know, the rise of China.

124
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
We can accommodate that.

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,870
We can make them like us.

126
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,990
No, we can't.

127
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,510
It is, again, it's a very dangerous state
that

128
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,170
we're dealing with and it has no intention

129
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,300
of being co-opted and turned into a democratic
country

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,570
that respects rule of law, respects human
rights,

131
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,500
respects democracy.

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,280
Everything they do, everything they do in
terms of their people,

133
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,540
censoring our thoughts overseas, setting up
proxy armies.

134
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Say for example in Myanmar,

135
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,680
the largest non-state military force and most
effective in Asia,

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,030
and arguably much of the world is the United
Wa State Army.

137
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,220
It influences every decision made by the government
of Myanmar,

138
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,230
Burma, as we call it in America.

139
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,950
Well, where are they getting those brand new
tanks?

140
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,669
Where are they getting those brand new helicopters,

141
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,950
those brand new uniforms.

142
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,930
The AKs coming out of the crates still in
cosmoline.

143
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:04,490
They it just fall off the lorry of a PLA truck
in Southern Yunnan.

144
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,460
It's being provided on a systematic basis,

145
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,400
along with the education training facilities.

146
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,110
All the other things that United Wa State
Army

147
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,020
needs to be a coercive proxy army within the
borders of Myanmar.

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,840
So this is the nature of the beast we're dealing
with.

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,010
So that's why we care.

150
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,220
The nature of the regime here is incredibly
intimidating.

151
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,830
It's totalitarian, and it's not one we can
afford to let win

152
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,510
and hence we must do a much better job of
fighting

153
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,650
on the political warfare battlefields.

154
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,270
So I think this is a very important point
that you're touching on,

155
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,020
that political warfare is not the same as

156
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,120
the normal kind of competition that all countries
engage in?

157
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,080
Political warfare is war, and that is how
the PRC sees it.

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,300
They're waging war against us.

159
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,150
Now, think back about 20 years ago.

160
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,580
There was a fellow running around in Southwest
Asia who was saying,

161
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,590
"America, I'm at war with you.

162
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,590
I'm at war with you.

163
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,590
I'm going to kill your people.

164
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm at war with you."

165
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,810
And a lot of the officials in Washington DC
were saying,

166
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,740
"Yeah, look, you got a towel on your head.

167
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,300
You live in a cave.

168
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,800
You're nothing serious."

169
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,270
Well then on September 11th,

170
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,699
2001 when we had a several thousand Americans
die,

171
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,780
very hideous deaths at the hands of this individual.

172
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,430
Finally, the US government woke up and said,

173
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,430
"Yeah, no kidding.

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,470
He was at war with us."

175
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,880
We need to have the same recognition of

176
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,400
what the people's Republic of China's war
against us.

177
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,789
How that falls out, what that looks like,

178
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,870
and we can't do that based on our own lack
of education.

179
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,529
No one in senior US department of defense
schools

180
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,250
teaches PRC political warfare.

181
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,240
At the academies of course, but when you were
national war colleges,

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,940
your army war college, your a Naval war college,

183
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,440
your national defense university,

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
it isn't preparing us on the military side.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,290
Then you get you have a flawed defense strategy

186
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,980
that can't respond to the political warfare
that PLA

187
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,120
is waging very effectively against us,

188
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,760
and co-opting incidentally retired,

189
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,950
a vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff

190
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,220
was co-opted under what we call a liaison
program,

191
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,460
a United Front program and as well as

192
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,550
a number of other senior American military
officers.

193
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,100
Same issue on the state department side.

194
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
The Schultz Center,

195
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,029
the Foreign Service Institute at Arlington,
Virginia.

196
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,760
They don't teach it.

197
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,100
Go talk to them, interview them and say,

198
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,240
"How do you prepare either our entry level
diplomats,

199
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
our foreign service officers,

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,839
or the ones coming back from mid level training
or other training.

201
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,540
How do you prepare them to deal with the existential
threat

202
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,790
posed by Beijing with it's political warfare."

203
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,640
The existential threat being, again,

204
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,760
they're trying to destroy our country.

205
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,710
Again, Taiwan is the major target,

206
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,330
but every one of our friends and allies,

207
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,290
how are we preparing our diplomats to do that?

208
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,350
We're not.

209
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,370
Why not?

210
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,390
Complacency.

211
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,730
We won the cold war.

212
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,110
So at the end of the cold war we shut down
our capabilities

213
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,529
to fight on the information battlefield, effectively.

214
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,710
We shut down the US Information Agency.

215
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,710
Arguably it had gotten soft,

216
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,060
it had gotten rotten inside.

217
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,220
It needed to be reformed, it did not need
to be shut down.

218
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,529
The state department was ill-equipped psychologically,
ideologically,

219
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,630
and in terms of manpower to take on that mantle,

220
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,520
especially when it looked like we were Chris
at the end of history,

221
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,990
we didn't need to worry about totalitarian
regimes anymore.

222
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,020
Everything was going to be peace, love, happiness
and flowers,

223
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,480
and so we didn't need that capability.

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,700
Now that's a downside.

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,540
We have become complacent.

226
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,020
We don't have the education system

227
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,450
in either our government institutions

228
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,310
or our civilian academic institutions.

229
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,310
Go to Georgetown,

230
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,100
go to any other universities that pump out
our future diplomats.

231
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,750
See what programs they have to address political
warfare,

232
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,810
pretty much nonexistent.

233
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,700
So the the downside is we are totally unprepared.

234
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
We have generations of diplomats,

235
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,930
generations of department of commerce personnel
at least since 1992,

236
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,320
they're not getting any preparation to deal
with this,

237
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,149
and hence they can't recognize it.

238
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,970
A problem within our country,

239
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,090
but a problem also within our friends and
allies.

240
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,820
Most of them can't recognize it or if they
can recognize it,

241
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,700
they have zero capacity to fight back.

242
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,191
I think the Chinese communist party

243
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:46,150
would accuse you of a cold war mentality.

244
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,149
I'm saddened, I'm hurt, I'm angered, and I'm
irked,

245
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,540
which is the way that they have conditioned
our news media

246
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,230
and many of our, again, government officials
to respond to anything

247
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,560
that is along the lines of what I just said
about China,

248
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,240
any criticism of China.

249
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,370
We have become conditioned in many cases to
do anything we can

250
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,410
to not anger or upset China.

251
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,890
I get those three words specifically because

252
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,460
if you look at Reuters headlines routinely,

253
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,660
they will always have a headline such as,

254
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,120
"In an a move guaranteed to anger or upset
China.

255
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,991
President Tsai, for example, from Taiwan,

256
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,550
has said she wants democracy

257
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,140
and not one country, two systems for Taiwan."

258
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,459
Reuters could just as easily have written,

259
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,899
"In a move designed to hearten,

260
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,070
give hope to the the free people of Taiwan.

261
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,020
President Tsai has said, we want freedom.

262
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,100
We want democracy.

263
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,870
We don't want one country, two systems."

264
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,140
But again, our news media, many of our academics,

265
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,279
our think tank world, has been infiltrated.

266
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,850
It's been co-opted in many ways,

267
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:06,490
many in there have allowed themselves

268
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,210
to have their thoughts controlled,

269
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,710
where they instinctively will say what China

270
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,310
wants them to say so as not to upset China,

271
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,459
or in some cases not to upset the flow of
funding

272
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,350
from Chinese organizations.

273
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,730
So based on what you're saying,

274
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,490
it's not so much that the Chinese Communist
Party

275
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,990
is forcing people to act in a way they want.

276
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,020
It's more that they are manipulating them
to,

277
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,560
of their own accord do what the communist
party wants?

278
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,660
It's psychological manipulation that gets
people

279
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:42,860
to the point that they will do instinctively
what they think that China,

280
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,520
the CCP wants them to do, so as not to offend
China.

281
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
So what you have then is preemptive actions.

282
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,029
For example, we've seen this within our own
Department of State

283
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,959
where a lot of the policies that restrict
interaction

284
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,150
with free and democratic Taiwan,

285
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,070
they were never the result of any agreements
with Beijing.

286
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,370
They weren't even presidential level directives.

287
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,290
They were just self-imposed restraints,

288
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,550
increasingly oppressive over the years

289
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,600
within the US government bureaucracy,

290
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,209
that restrained us from what we could do

291
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,360
to support this country to survive.

292
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,340
That extended everything from the arm sales

293
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,779
at the Taiwan Relations Act

294
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,700
was supposed to ... they were supposed to
go on routinely.

295
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Somehow they went back to what, almost zero,

296
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,450
for a total of eight years.

297
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,240
As far as interaction, ship visits even.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,410
There's no agreement that says we can't send
a ship to Kaohsiung,

299
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,850
a US military ship to Kaohsiung.

300
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,850
There's a lot of-

301
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,850
The southern city in Taiwan?

302
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,860
The southern city, the major port in southern
Taiwan.

303
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,550
There all kinds of interaction that was prohibited

304
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,750
because it's self restraint,

305
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,110
under what I would call the red matrix.

306
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,770
I didn't come up with that term,

307
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,330
but the red matrix is you live in this matrix
like world where

308
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,470
you just do everything you think will please
China.

309
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,050
We can't say anything bad about China.

310
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,300
We can't call China totalitarian.

311
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,690
We can't call China fascist.

312
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,950
I've seen this in the think tank world.

313
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,450
I used to work there.

314
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,480
We can't even call it a dictatorship.

315
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,610
Well, why?

316
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,690
Marianne Webster are on our side in this case.

317
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,149
Look up the definition of fascist.

318
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,160
Look up the definition of totalitarian.

319
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,110
Every element in Merriam Webster, the PRC
fulfills.

320
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,110
Dictatorship.

321
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,500
That's written right in its constitution.

322
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,180
Yet I've heard people in the think tank world

323
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,870
and even US government officials saying,

324
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,580
"Well, we won't call it a dictatorship publicly.

325
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,730
We just can't say that about China."

326
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,160
That's the Lord Voldemort syndrome that we
see.

327
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,270
A lot of my students grow up with Harry Potter.

328
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,670
They understand the concept.

329
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,300
We can't say Lord Voldemort's name because
bad things will happen.

330
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,140
Well, we see the under this red matrix,

331
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,110
this self-censorship,

332
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,580
the lower Voldemort's syndrome in play.

333
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,029
Not just in the United States,

334
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,590
not just in an academia here in Taiwan.

335
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,360
In many cases, it's throughout the world.

336
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,660
So the PRC, to give the PRC credit where credit
is due,

337
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,000
it's political warfare has been tremendously
successful worldwide,

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in many cases.

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Now you could say,

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,020
"Well, the election outcome the other day
shows that it wasn't perfect."

341
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,240
No, but it's still ongoing.

342
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,620
They see political warfare as a perpetual
struggle,

343
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,100
"Okay, there's ebbs and flows.

344
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,270
We don't have to go kinetic.

345
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,520
We don't have to go to mid intensity conflict,

346
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,350
but we're going to keep the struggle going
perpetually

347
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,330
until we win."

348
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, all right, so let's get specific.

349
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,800
What is the Chinese Communist Party doing

350
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,950
as far as political warfare goes in Taiwan?

351
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,899
In Taiwan, they've a co-opted a lot of the
news media.

352
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,390
They bought for example, through,

353
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,250
again, this is through surrogates.

354
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,079
Everything's a little bit hard to prove in
a court of law,

355
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,669
but in reality, those in the know know what's
going on.

356
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,439
For example, radio stations down South

357
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,030
where they don't read newspapers as much,

358
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,399
but the radio in the rural areas is very important.

359
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,399
They bought the radio,

360
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:22,119
many radio stations that used to be either
pro Taiwan,

361
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,179
or certainly pro freedom and democracy.

362
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,139
Now you see a very heavy influence of PRC
propaganda

363
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:32,929
being broadcast over those radio stations.

364
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,700
Want Want, the Times, the different news media
either online,

365
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,239
and or print, that they've been bought or
co-opted here.

366
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,580
So you've got the news media, you've got from
the mainland,

367
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,840
massive social media attacks and social media
infiltration

368
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,799
pretending to be either concern Taiwanese,

369
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,659
pretending to be even Americans.

370
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,009
There's all kinds of ways they're trying to
influence

371
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:04,679
on the very extensive social media battle
ground.

372
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,759
Infiltration of academia.

373
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:12,399
There are certainly professors who have gone
what we call pan-Red here.

374
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:16,020
Political parties for those who aren't familiar
with Taiwan,

375
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,559
DPP Democratic Progressive Parties is a pan-Green.

376
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,350
The KMT is a pan-Blue.

377
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,039
Well, there's another party,

378
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,399
there's other colors as well,

379
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,039
in this color spectrum of political parties
here.

380
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,220
But the ones who've gone over to the PRC,

381
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,350
the ones who are pro quote, reunification,
and that's a misnomer.

382
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,149
But we'll use the PRC term,

383
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,389
the ones who are pro reunification and want
to do it tomorrow,

384
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,330
on Beijing's terms, we call them pan-Reds.

385
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,929
So even they have infiltrated academia

386
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,149
and they have a tremendous influence,

387
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,399
or at least tremendous capability to influence,

388
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,330
the young people of Taiwan

389
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,049
because you have to get A's from those professors.

390
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,789
You have to get their recommendations

391
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,630
if you want to go on for master's degrees,

392
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,080
if you want to go on for PhD.

393
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,640
In many cases they dictate your success or
failure in academia.

394
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,210
If you do what they want, if you to go along,
you get along.

395
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,330
If you don't do what they want, a

396
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,679
nd what they want is for you to support the
PRC, you have trouble.

397
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,740
Well, so what is Taiwan doing about this?

398
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,480
Taiwan has begun to take some steps.

399
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Taiwan is at a disadvantage,

400
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,970
just like the United States because at the
end of the cold war

401
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,299
when we dismantled our capability to fight

402
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,730
on the political warfare battlefields,

403
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,559
that was around the time that Taiwan was democratizing,

404
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,480
and they were able to speak freely about the
white terror,

405
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,610
which was the era when the the KMT ruled with
an iron hand

406
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,659
and basically slaughtered a lot of people
here,

407
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,990
and repressed civil rights,

408
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,759
and used rule of law to oppress people

409
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,720
rather than to provide them

410
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,249
what we would expect a democracy to provide.

411
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:06,679
Well, around the 1980s the son of Chiang Kai
Shek,

412
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:07,679
to his great credit,

413
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,509
who had been schooled incidentally ...

414
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,649
Chiang had a son who had been schooled

415
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,710
in Leninist political warfare,

416
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,759
and Leninist tactics within the Soviet union.

417
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,690
But he helped lead his country to democracy,

418
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,470
with the ability to publicly speak about

419
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,759
that really vicious era of repression.

420
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,870
In my mind,

421
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,440
this country went too far the other way in
eliminating laws,

422
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,179
eliminating capabilities that would allow
them to detect,

423
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,100
expose and take appropriate legal action against
infiltration.

424
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,999
Rather recently, last month, I believe,

425
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:55,239
it was the end of the last year.

426
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,539
At the end of December, the anti infiltration
law was passed.

427
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:01,950
That was a massive first step in helping to
cut down the amount of money,

428
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,419
the amount of influence that could come in
from overseas affecting,

429
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,769
for example, elections.

430
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,999
Much more needs to be done though in terms
of educating the public,

431
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:15,620
educating government officials,

432
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,179
educating business leaders about the threats

433
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,559
posed by PRC political warfare.

434
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,759
So why should Americans be concerned about
w

435
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,989
hat the Chinese Communist Party's trying to
do in Taiwan?

436
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:35,729
Well, first of all, Taiwan is an existential
threat to the CCP.

437
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,720
Americans are slowly beginning to realize

438
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,289
that we're in strategic competition with the
People's Republic of China.

439
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:51,649
They don't understand fully that the PRC is
at war with us.

440
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:55,809
Where Taiwan plays a very important role is
again,

441
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,639
it poses the existential threat to the Chinese
Communist Party

442
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:07,369
because it shows that Chinese people can rule
themselves in a democracy.

443
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,879
It is the narrative from the CCP,

444
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:13,179
that Chinese people can't have freedom,

445
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,690
they can't have democracy, can't rule themselves.

446
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,659
They need the jackboot of oppression to keep
the country

447
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,590
from fragmenting and having all the splitist
split

448
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,769
and the country devolving into chaos.

449
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,049
Now Taiwan proves Chinese people can rule
themselves

450
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,269
and they can survive with dignity,

451
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:32,639
and they can survive with prosperity,

452
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:35,549
under that democratic rule.

453
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,230
So that's one of the many reasons.

454
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,039
There are several reasons that that Beijing
wants to take Taiwan.

455
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,659
For Americans, they have to realize we need
to stand by democracies,

456
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,980
democracies worldwide, and especially Taiwan.

457
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,049
Taiwan has stood up heroically,

458
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,739
and almost alone, to the CCP.

459
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,950
If Taiwan can stand up,

460
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,169
just like the Hong Kong protesters have been,

461
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,570
they've achieved some remarkable things,

462
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,440
especially with the elections in Hong Kong.

463
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,960
If Taiwan can continue to stand up against
an expansionist,

464
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,071
brutally repressive fascist totalitarian regime

465
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:15,750
that gives hope to democracies around the
world.

466
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,059
America must support Taiwan,

467
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,480
for our own self interest and the interests
of Japan,

468
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
Republic of Korea, all the association of
Southeast Asian nations,

469
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,350
ASEAN nations, in the region,

470
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,010
you best hope Taiwan doesn't fall

471
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,080
because if this Island falls to the PRC,

472
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,399
then it becomes a power projection platform.

473
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:39,299
They don't care about the people of Taiwan
and Beijing.

474
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,440
I think they'll treat them like Xinjiang,

475
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,820
treat them like East Turkestan.

476
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,909
They'll have concentration camps.

477
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:47,679
I think they'll do the worst they can to punish
them,

478
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,610
if they do reunify.

479
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,649
That's my personal opinion.

480
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:52,159
But more importantly,

481
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,820
rather than even dealing with the people,

482
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,009
what the PLA, what the CCP also wants this
Island for,

483
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,450
submarine pens, airfields, so they can project
power

484
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,519
further into the South China Sea,

485
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,560
and into Oceania where they have, frankly
a Neo colonization effort

486
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,489
going on throughout the Pacific islands, a

487
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:18,820
nd a massive malign influence campaigns in
Australia, and New Zealand.

488
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,070
They can support those political warfare campaigns
in Oceania,

489
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,059
Pacific islands, down to Australia, New Zealand

490
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,799
with military power better now,

491
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,869
not just the PLA Navy,

492
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:36,690
but strategic bombers out of Taiwan,

493
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,149
other vessels and power projection forces
based here.

494
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,740
So the countries who are democracies,

495
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,700
those countries that are democracies around
the world,

496
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,039
best support a democracy like Taiwan,

497
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,599
the David against Goliath here.

498
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,440
But also those countries that even are

499
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,110
authoritarians in the Asia Pacific region,

500
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,529
but do not want to be under the jackboot of
Beijing's oppression.

501
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:05,840
They best hope that Taiwan does not fall

502
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,749
and become a power protection base for the
People's Liberation Army.

503
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,780
Well I know the Chinese Communist Party

504
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,629
would say that it's really the United States

505
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:17,909
that's the real troublemaker in the Pacific.

506
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,860
How would you respond to people who argue

507
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,649
that the United States is actually the worst
aggressor?

508
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:28,369
I lose a lot of sleep over that accusation
by Beijing.

509
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,369
It's tormented me.

510
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,519
It haunts me.

511
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,519
They-

512
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,519
Irks you?

513
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,639
Yeah, it upsets me as well.

514
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:36,659
As well, look,

515
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,320
it's one of many propaganda narratives

516
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,919
and it's successful in some places.

517
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,769
I've seen the success that they've had,

518
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:46,230
the infiltrating in the countries that are
supposedly

519
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,659
friends and allies of America.

520
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,929
They've done a pretty good job of infiltrating
on social media

521
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,450
and people buy into that line that we're the
troublemaker.

522
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,700
The reality is we're the only guarantor of
freedom, democracy,

523
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,909
rule of law, post Westphalian rights, within
this region.

524
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:10,999
If America is not here and to use the PRC
lexicon,

525
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,769
"Making trouble," that is standing up for
democracies like Taiwan,

526
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:18,259
like Japan, like the Republic of Korea, Australia,
New Zealand.

527
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:22,149
If we're not here, no one else will have the
strength to do it.

528
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:25,789
And so we have seen what has happened in the
past

529
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:31,929
when totalitarian regimes have marched forward
and no one stood up.

530
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,390
You know peace in our time,

531
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,169
we remember the appeasement in Europe in the
1930s

532
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,429
when no one was willing to stand up to Hitler.”

533
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,700
We'll just give him the Sudetenland.

534
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,129
Okay, Czechoslovakia, that's fine.

535
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,190
He'll be happy.

536
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,190
He'll be happy."

537
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,679
No, they're never happy.

538
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,659
So we cannot appease.

539
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,200
We must confront.

540
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,359
We must stop the forward march, the expansionism.

541
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,519
We must be able to counter the political warfare,

542
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,519
which is again,

543
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,720
their primary means of winning what they want
to achieve.

544
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,940
We need to effectively counter it,

545
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,340
and then we have a chance of surviving,

546
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,659
Taiwan will be able to survive, the other
democracies will.

547
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,140
But they cannot do it on their own.

548
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,090
The United States, just as in the cold war,

549
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,179
the United States has to be the leader, the
unifying force.

550
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,909
The powerful country that can give encouragement,

551
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,349
give material support, gives psychological
support,

552
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,039
other types of support to those nations

553
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,639
standing up against the totalitarian regime
that is on the march.

554
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,769
So if anyone watching wanted to learn more
about

555
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,710
you or political warfare, where should they
go?

556
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,369
Well, they can Google my name,

557
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,880
In Political Warfare, a number of articles
will come up,

558
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,710
about 20 in the past year and a half.

559
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,179
They also can go to Project 2049 Institute.

560
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,760
They can go to the Global Taiwan Institute.

561
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,799
They can go to the Hudson Institute.

562
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:09,379
Now you're beginning to see good organizations
like the three,

563
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:15,860
and there more, exposing PRC political warfare.

564
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,049
They've all done some very good work on political
warfare.

565
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,950
Not enough though.

566
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,320
We need to encourage masters candidates.

567
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,809
We need to encourage PhD candidates at the
university level

568
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,619
to do their thesis on the issue.

569
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,750
It's not just do it on soft power,

570
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:40,080
or hard power, or now the popular term is
sharp power.

571
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,759
No, do it on political warfare,

572
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,519
that's the real battle that we're fighting.

573
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,130
Delve into it.

574
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,110
Professors need to encourage that.

575
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,559
So professors need to get out of the Lord
Voldemort syndrome

576
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:56,019
and start looking into the whole issue themselves.

577
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,330
And again, government officials.

578
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,690
If government grants start flowing

579
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,669
to academic institutions and think tanks

580
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,490
to pursue this and come up with solutions,

581
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,469
"how can we effectively counter,

582
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:09,529
how can we effectively fight and win on the
information battlefield

583
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,960
to counter PRC political warfare?"

584
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,349
You'll start seeing a lot more intellectual
effort

585
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,769
being invested into this.

586
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,020
As I understand, you do have a book you're
working on?

587
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,629
Got a book that will be published sometime
in late spring or early June,

588
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,940
I'll give you more information on it when
it's published.

589
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,320
But at this point it's coming along very nicely

590
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,429
and it will address a large part of what we
talked about today,

591
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:37,889
but in substantive detail with somewhere around
400 foot notes.

592
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:38,889
Fantastic.

593
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:39,929
I'm looking forward to it.

594
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:40,420
Okay.

595
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,380
Thank you very much, Chris.

596
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,100
Thanks for being here.

597
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,740
Honored to be here with you.
