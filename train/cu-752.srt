00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,240
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,760
China uncensors America.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,339
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,690
You know, a lot of you have said things like,

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,640
“Hey Chris, stop criticizing China!

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,660
You should do America Uncensored.”

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,500
Well, guess what?

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,820
China Central Television has already done
it for me!

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,600
Last month, state-run CCTV broadcast

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,420
this documentary to millions of households across China.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,749
As they pursue human rights,

12
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,920
does the US judge other countries,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,649
or are they equal with them?

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,469
This is the human rights record of the human
rights defender.

15
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:49,949
So, I decided to watch this 45-minute, awkwardly
titled documentary.

16
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:54,859
Fortunately, they added English subtitles
to the version on their US website.

17
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,909
It begins...here.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,080
Now don’t worry, not everything they point
out happened five decades ago.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,390
But it’s true, the US army did some pretty
terrible things in Vietnam.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,290
CCTV then goes on to describe

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,619
a dozen other more recent human rights problems America has.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,759
For example, police violence.

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,619
And privacy violations.

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,450
And of course, racism.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
After watching all this,

26
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,659
I was absolutely outraged, because...

27
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,539
I actually agree with CCTV.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,680
America does have problems.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,519
And CCTV is absolutely right to point them
out.

30
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,629
I was even going to say so in the comments
below

31
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,090
but CCTV’s comments section seems to be
disabled.

32
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,580
But my point is, exposing America’s problems
is healthy.

33
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,610
It helps us improve.

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,010
That’s why America’s founding fathers
wanted a free press.

35
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,480
Americans are pointing out America’s problems,
too.

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,340
For every single problem CCTV talks about,

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,959
there have already been public protests

38
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,670
that the police permitted, and the American
media covered.

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,790
In fact, CCTV used American media coverage
of those protests in their documentary.

40
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,730
Americans have protested everything.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,140
The Vietnam War.

42
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
Police brutality.

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,580
Mass surveillance.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,540
Racism.

45
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,560
Because in America,

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,330
the government and media don’t pretend that
America doesn’t have its own problems.

47
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,330
Even elected officials here are free to speak
their minds:

48
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,330
"I'm Matt Rosendale and this is how I look from a government drone.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,580
Spying on our citizens

50
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,260
that’s just wrong.

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm Matt Rosendale and I approve this message."

52
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,329
And so while I agree with CCTV that there
really are human rights problems in the US,

53
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,849
it’s their conclusion that has a major flaw.

54
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,579
Dialogue and not criticism,

55
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,470
cooperation and not antagonism
are the correct path for

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,489
promoting the human rights
of every country.

57
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:49,610
What they’re really saying is: Don’t criticize
China until you fix your own problems first.

58
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,330
By that logic, during World War II,

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,960
America should never have helped liberate
Nazi concentration camps

60
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,589
because America had its own internment camps
for the Japanese.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,640
Look, if everyone had to be perfect before
they could point out other people's issues,

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,580
what kind of world would we live in?

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,120
America isn’t great because it doesn’t
have problems.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,720
America has lots of problems.

65
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,549
America is great because it gives Americans
the ability to publicly address those problems.

66
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,189
We even have an entire genre of comedy shows

67
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:25,369
that are all doing some version of America Uncensored.

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,180
So when CCTV asks,

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,960
"As they pursue human rights,

70
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,710
does the US judge other countries,

71
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,910
or are they equal with them?"

72
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,970
I say, no, the US is not equal with China.

73
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,160
Not until I can go to China,

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,710
interview experts there who can speak freely,

75
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,470
use footage of Chinese protests broadcast
by local Chinese media,

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,060
criticize Chinese policy however I want,

77
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,340
and upload my videos to a China-based website...

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,630
without being “harmonized.”

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,509
But until then,

80
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,870
I’ll just have to keep uncensoring China
from the good ol’ U.S. of A.

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,490
And look, if CCTV wants to upload their propaganda
documentary to a US-based website,

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,520
I say go for it.

83
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,490
Just don't disable the comments.

84
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,319
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

85
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,030
Don't forget to comment below however you
want.

86
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,400
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.
