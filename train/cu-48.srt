1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,739
China is pushing a Coronavirus scam

2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:06,200
While the disease spreads in the Middle East

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,830
And around the world

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,040
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,220
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,400
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,099
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,439
An update on the coronavirus disease,

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,769
also called COVID-19.

10
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:28,589
It’s now spread to at least 47 countries.

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,599
But the World Health Organization

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,000
is declining to call it a pandemic.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Cool.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Just like they declined to call it

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,640
a global health emergency a month ago.

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,800
Now a pandemic means that a disease

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,970
is spreading around the world.

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,280
And the W.H.O. used to have specific criteria

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,410
for declaring a pandemic.

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,790
And with outbreaks in China,

21
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,130
South Korea, Italy, and Iran,

22
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,710
COVID-19 would likely have met those criteria.

23
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,850
But the good news is,

24
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,830
now the W.H.O.’s criteria for pandemics

25
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,170
is a lot more...vague.

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,010
According to the director general,

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,320
the coronavirus is not a pandemic because
there

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,420
hasn’t been “uncontained global spread”

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,170
or “large-scale severe disease or death.”

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,490
Instead the head of the W.H.O. says these
are

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,240
“epidemics in different parts of the world.”

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,549
I mean, South Korea is reporting record daily
spikes

33
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,840
and Japan is closing all schools.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,090
It’s spreading throughout the Middle East,

35
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,409
With Iran having the highest death toll outside
of China,

36
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,759
And the guy in charge of fighting it in Iran
was infected.

37
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,609
Coronavirus cases are also surging in Italy.

38
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,609
And spreading from Italy to the rest of Europe.

39
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,990
And it’s in Latin America now.

40
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,810
But thank goodness it’s not a pandemic yet.

41
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,401
However, official numbers of new coronavirus
cases

42
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,560
are down in China.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,389
Unfortunately, that might just be because
the Communist Party

44
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:55,530
has a coronavirus scam—

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,969
changing the definition of what an infection
is.

46
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,469
They’ve changed the definition 6 times so
far.

47
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,810
So what does it mean that the numbers are
going down?

48
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,179
According to an expert

49
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,840
at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security,

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,099
“There are two possibilities —

51
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,940
the draconian social distancing measures China
has taken

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,680
are really driving down the number of cases...

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,030
or health officials are changing their view

54
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,819
of what constitutes a case.”

55
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,769
Kind of like how the Party lifted

56
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,700
millions of people out of poverty,

57
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,900
by changing the definition of what poverty
meant.

58
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,019
Most of those people are called “low-income”
now.

59
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,870
Problem solved!

60
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,520
But one thing we can all confidently count
on

61
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,569
is the lack of medical supplies since everything
is made in China.

62
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,989
The Coronavirus is hitting the Chinese economy
hard.

63
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,459
Factories are struggling to start up again
after being shut down.

64
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,140
Only a third of Chinese small businesses are
open.

65
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,269
And migrant workers,

66
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,200
a critical part of the Chinese economy,

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,310
can’t move throughout the country

68
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,329
because of quarantines and border restrictions.

69
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,430
You know what that means?

70
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,670
Now’s the right time to buy Chinese stocks!

71
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,590
And JPMorgan says the Chinese economy

72
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,390
will grow in the second quarter.

73
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,500
I mean, just think about

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,989
how much money can be made in China!

75
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,470
There’s probably no downside at all!

76
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,760
Especially if you don’t learn from history!

77
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,110
I wish I knew how to quit you.

78
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,129
Well then why don’t you?!

79
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,110
The Trump Administration is considering

80
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,349
punishing Chinese state-run news organizations

81
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,370
operating in the United States.

82
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,269
That’s in retaliation for China

83
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,780
kicking out three Wall Street Journal Reporters.

84
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,590
Which itself was possibly retaliation for
the US labeling

85
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,129
Chinese state-run media operatives of China’s
communist state.

86
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,030
Which...they are.

87
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,200
Some of them are part of the Chinese Communist
Party’s

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,500
Central Propaganda Department.

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,879
Others are directly under the Party’s Central
Committee.

90
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,129
Reporters with state-run media in the US

91
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,620
have been accused of essentially spying for
the Communist Party.

92
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,650
That’s why the new punishments the Trump
Administration

93
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,659
are considering may include, “expelling
journalists

94
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,519
who have contact with intelligence agencies.”

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,709
Then again, I have to say,

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,499
my opinion of Chinese state-run media really
changed

97
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,410
after China Daily called China Uncensored,

98
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,400
a “leading Western media outlet.”

99
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,729
Also, “disgraceful anti-China garbage,

100
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,710
which seems to have come out of a gossip rag.”

101
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,910
Sorry Global Times.

102
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,970
I think China Daily is my new favorite Chinese
state-run media.

103
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,430
Two major Apple shareholders pushed for a
proposal

104
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,720
that would force Apple to disclose censorship
requests

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,990
from China and any other country.

106
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,830
“The motion, set to be voted on

107
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,880
by the company’s investors [this week],

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,990
was prompted by numerous allegations

109
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,380
of Apple kowtowing to Beijing

110
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,190
and blocking apps from being used by Chinese
customers.”

111
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,100
That includes Apple removing VPNs at Beijing’s
request.

112
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,880
So that Chinese people can’t access

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,470
the outside internet on their iPhones.

114
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,930
But good news for Apple!

115
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,979
The votes are in and...

116
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,530
Apple will not be held accountable.

117
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,820
Apple’s major shareholders are all large
corporations,

118
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,690
which themselves mostly have investments in
China.

119
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,970
So really, this helps everyone not be held
accountable.

120
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,490
But there is at least *some* good news this
week.

121
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,670
On February 19,

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,580
you saw our episode about how the Chinese
Consulate in New York

123
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,110
put up an exhibit about Tibet in the Queens
Public Library—

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,580
full of all sorts of propaganda.

125
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,449
Well, this week,

126
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,039
thanks to unrelenting pressure from local
Tibetans,

127
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,440
and also possibly China Uncensored

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,010
pestering library officials for comment,

129
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,800
the Library took the exhibit down.

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,470
Tibetans can finally celebrate a victory

131
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,110
against the Chinese Communist Party.

132
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,330
Tibetans in exile, at least.

133
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,130
And that’s it for this week’s China news.

134
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,470
Now it’s time for me to answer a question

135
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,669
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

136
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,970
on the crowd funding website Patreon!

137
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,741
Today’s question comes from Joe King

138
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:06,870
“Chris, do you think that while the plaque

139
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,669
will be placed into the box for shipping,

140
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,880
our cherry blossoms of joy will spread their
petals

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,160
above the google exec's dew of shameful tears?”

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,710
I think that’s my favorite question ever.

143
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,669
So, China Uncensored just hit 1 million subscribers.

144
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,680
Supposedly that means YouTube will send us
a plaque like this.

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,729
This comes after YouTube and Google

146
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,910
have been suppressing the show.

147
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,200
Subscribers have been secretly unsubscribed.

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,479
People don’t get notifications of new episodes,

149
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,590
even when the notification bell is on.

150
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,349
Videos have been demonetized, age-restricted,

151
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,160
or taken down with no explanation.

152
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,910
China Uncensored rarely turns up in suggested
videos,

153
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,639
and for years, if you tried to search China
Uncensored,

154
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,340
the suggested text would be China Uncensorship
pollution,

155
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,520
which is definitely a real thing.

156
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,850
We struggle to even get our t-shirt merchandise
approved.

157
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,449
And yet despite all this,

158
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,740
China Uncensored has continued to grow,

159
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,710
even as the revenue from YouTube continues
to plummet.

160
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,819
This has been possible because you

161
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,530
are watching and sharing the videos

162
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,599
and you continue to support the show

163
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,110
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

164
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,099
So YouTube and Google have failed to stop
us,

165
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,490
and that’s all because of you.

166
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,310
So I can only imagine that plaque

167
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,449
will be bathed in a gentle mist

168
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,860
of the tears of those Google execs

169
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,970
who still long to get back into China.

170
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,139
That is if they ever ship it to us.

171
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,430
I’m not going to hold my breath.

172
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,639
Thanks for your question and your support,
Joe King.

173
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,419
And if you’d like to join the China Uncensored
50-cent army,

174
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,310
head over to patreon.com/chinauncensored to
learn more.

175
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,520
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

176
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

177
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,880
See you next time.
