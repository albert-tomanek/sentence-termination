00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,480
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,040
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,500
This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,220
Protect your privacy online.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,720
Now, my team of high-powered market researchers

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
has told me I need to make China Uncensored

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,180
more appealing to Generation Z.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,059
And that’s why I joined “The Tick Tock.”

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,340
It’s just “TikTok.”

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,870
Fine. “TikTok.”

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,650
TikTok has 500 million active users worldwide,

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,210
including pretty much everyone under 25.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,210
It’s...fire.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,350
Who are you? How did you even get in here?

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,920
Look. I get that Tik Tok is the coolest new
app.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,800
Or littest. Or most Gucci, fam.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,170
I hate myself right now.

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,680
But the biggest problem,

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,580
other than my own looming mortality,

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,650
is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,450
Back in 2017, a Chinese company called ByteDance

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,820
bought the social media app Musical.ly

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,130
for close to one billion dollars.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,800
Musical.ly was based in Shanghai,

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,080
but had its most users in the US,

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,670
where it caught on with American teens.

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,510
Then they merged Musical.ly’s userbase into
TikTok,

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,690
and that allowed them to slide TikTok into
the US market.

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,950
Now, you might think,

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,730
“So what if TikTok is owned by a Chinese
company?”

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,740
Well, if you’re worried about “FBI Man”
watching you...

32
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,410
...you should be way more concerned about
“MSS Man” watching you.

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,940
MSS is China’s Ministry of State Security.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,060
They’re seriously scary dudes.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,610
Or whatever zoomers call dudes these days.

36
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,140
And China has very different laws about data
privacy.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,010
Namely, in China, there’s no privacy.

38
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,209
Chinese law says Chinese companies that collect
user data

39
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,530
have to share that data with the Chinese government
upon request.

40
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,820
It’s not that Chinese authorities actively
monitor every user’s data in real time,

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,440
but “The reality is that if and when Beijing
makes a demand,

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,540
it is hard for Chinese-based companies to
say no.”

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,400
And that’s why it might be concerning that
a Chinese company—

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,750
ByteDance—owns TikTok,

45
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,180
since TikTok collects so much user data.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,640
That data includes your username,

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,129
what you like, where you are in the world,

48
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,599
what’s being recorded by your

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,200
camera and microphone, et cetera.

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,069
And it’s not just *me speculating* about
security risks.

51
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,739
The US government has just opened a national
security investigation into TikTok.

52
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,379
The investigation is led by CFIUS—

53
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,730
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States.

54
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,380
CFIUS is an interdepartmental group of federal
government agencies.

55
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,099
It investigates—and sometimes blocks—

56
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,090
deals by foreign companies that might pose
a risk to US national security.

57
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,879
For example, last year CFIUS blocked Chinese-owned
Ant Financial

58
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,450
from buying financial services company MoneyGram.

59
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,540
CFIUS also blocked IDG Energy Investment

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,300
from buying a bunch of oil and gas assets
in Texas.

61
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,690
And now CFIUS is forcing a Chinese company
to sell Grindr,

62
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,349
a gay dating app.

63
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,390
Chinese gaming company Kunlun Tech had purchased
Grindr last year,

64
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,209
without going through a CFIUS review.

65
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,900
CFIUS didn’t disclose specifically why the
Chinese buyout of Grindr

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,590
was a national security concern.

67
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,459
But I can just imagine what would happen

68
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,659
if the Chinese intelligence service

69
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,969
knew private information about Americans—

70
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,690
like who’s gay, who’s HIV-positive,

71
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,019
and had access to the, um, “pics” that
may *occasionally*

72
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,639
get sent by men using the Grindr app.

73
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,159
Imagine all the blackmail opportunities.

74
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,689
Anyway, back to TikTok.

75
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:12,689
Earlier this year,

76
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,250
there were also some concerns about TikTok’s
censorship.

77
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,320
It came after the Guardian got its hands

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,590
on TikTok’s content moderation policy.

79
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,040
It showed TikTok had been censoring content

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,020
that was embarrassing to the Chinese regime.

81
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,510
For example, there were reports that videos
about

82
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,080
the Hong Kong protests were being either blocked
completely,

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,030
or quietly labeled as “visible to self”,

84
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,040
so other users couldn’t see them.

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,780
And this applied to the American app TikTok,

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,210
not the Chinese version,

87
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,289
which goes by a different name.

88
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,150
But it seems that since May this year,

89
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,250
TikTok has changed its policies to distance
itself from Beijing.

90
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,720
TikTok now claims that it not censor content....

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,389
...while also not specifically admitting that
they ever did.

92
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,490
In an official statement, TikTok said,

93
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,730
“[Their] data centers are located entirely
outside of China,

94
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,650
and none of [their] data is subject to Chinese
law.”

95
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,949
They also said, “[they] have never been
asked

96
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,910
by the Chinese government to remove any content

97
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,660
and [they] would not do so if asked.”

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,840
Which is funny, because ByteDance,

99
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,669
the company that owns TikTok,

100
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,270
is completely governed by Chinese law.

101
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,419
That means the Chinese government could in
theory

102
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,490
require ByteDance to require TikTok to give
up user information.

103
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,020
Which means TikTok would give it to ByteDance,

104
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,520
which would give it to the Chinese government.

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,830
But I see no reason why the US government

106
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,480
should ban a Chinese-owned social media app.

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,300
Even though the *Chinese* government bans

108
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,449
pretty much all *American* social media apps,

109
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,000
like Twitter and Facebook.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,910
But still, CFIUS is investigating TikTok

111
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,190
as a potential a national security risk.

112
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,770
CFIUS just won’t reveal why,

113
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,220
since they “[do not] comment on information
relating to specific...cases.”

114
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,639
There are few things that could happen after
this review process.

115
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,710
CFIUS could decide TikTok is a risk,

116
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,040
and ban it outright. That’s unlikely.

117
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,550
CFIUS could decide that TikTok’s owner,

118
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,400
Bytedance, needs to sell off TikTok to an
American company.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,410
That’s what happened with Grindr—

120
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,960
although the difference is that TikTok

121
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,819
wasn’t an American company to begin with.

122
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,460
Or CFIUS could decide there’s no problem.

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,750
And then TikTok would be free to do...

124
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,090
whatever TikTok does.

125
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,970
Because frankly, I still don’t get the appeal.

126
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,440
What are you still doing here?!

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,789

130
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,199

or your internet service provider

134
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,069
from learning who or where you are.

135
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,370
And if you want to post subversive videos
to TikTok

136
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,770
in a country that won’t let you...

137
