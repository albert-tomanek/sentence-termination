00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:02,440
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,600
Wait, a story about Hong Kong

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,940
that’s actually hopeful?!

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,550
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,730
Finally some good news on the show!

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,880
It seems rare these days, doesn’t it?

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,970
Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong,

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,859
Alex Chow and Nathan Law

10
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:25,349
have had their prison sentences overturned.

11
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,660
Two years ago they had been sentenced

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,240
to community service for unlawful assembly

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,330
for their role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,930
That’s when tens of thousands of Hong Kongers

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,980
staged a mass protest against the Communist
Party

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,300
for going back on its promise

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,250
to give Hong Kong universal suffrage.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,780
Then last year they were resentenced

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,440
to prison for the same crime,

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,350
because the “Hong Kong government”

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,660
decided that their sentences

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,870
weren’t harsh enough

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,210
to deter other people

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,330
from protesting in the future.

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,850
Now they’ve all served time in prison,

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,550
so I’m not quite sure how the courts

27
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,420
will give them that part of their lives back,

28
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,880
unless they’ve discovered time travel.

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,399
Of course, time travel is illegal in China.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,679
It’s not all good news for protesters, though.

31
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:13,679
On one hand,

32
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,340
Hong Kong’s chief justice said,

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,060
“It would be inappropriate to retroactively

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,109
apply harsher penalties to the three.”

35
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:22,330
But on the other hand,

36
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,820
the judge also suggested that

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,149
from here on out,

38
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,429
the courts will be doling out harsh sentences

39
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,429
to anyone who gets out of line.

40
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,270
We wouldn’t want the young people

41
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,600
getting any more ideas.

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
But it will be hard to keep these things low
profile.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,149
Because 12 US Congresspeople

44
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:41,659
have nominated Wong, Chow, and Law,

45
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,530
as well as the entire Umbrella Movement,

46
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,859
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,549
Led by Senator Marco Rubio

48
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,429
and Congressman Chris Smith,

49
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,619
the lawmakers praised the Hong Kong activists

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,189
for boldly challenging the Chinese regime’s

51
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,100
erosion of the one country,

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,710
two systems model—

53
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,110
the model that was supposed to

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,189
protect Hong Kong from the CCP.

55
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,189
In response,

56
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,439
Chinese state-run media decided to maintain

57
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,360
a dignified silence on the issue.

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Just kidding.

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,840
They called it “ludicrous” that they would
nominate

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,700
those dangerous “rabble rousers”!

61
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Yeah, you rabble rousers!

62
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,840
Get off China’s lawn!

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,200
China’s Foreign Ministry even wrote a statement
to Reuters

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,080
calling the Umbrella Movement illegal from
head to toe.

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,150
Yes, Joshua Wong...illegal from head to toe.

66
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,150
And on Wednesday,

67
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,250
everyone’s favorite pro-Beijing group,

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,280
Voice of Loving Hong Kong,

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,000
showed just how much they love Hong Kong,

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,310
by protesting the Nobel Prize nomination

71
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,480
in front of the US and Norwegian consulates.

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Now at first,

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,790
you might think that’s a dumb place to protest.

74
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,650
The government of Norway

75
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,650
does not have a say

76
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,540
in who wins the Nobel Prize,

77
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,210
even though the Nobel organization

78
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,430
is headquartered in Norway.

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,530
But you see,

80
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,070
groups like the Voice of Loving Hong Kong

81
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,320
tend to be closely linked to the Chinese Communist
Party,

82
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,710
so you know, it’s hard for them

83
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,400
to understand that in free societies,

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,840
the government isn’t actually secretly controlling
everything.

85
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
So what do you think?

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
