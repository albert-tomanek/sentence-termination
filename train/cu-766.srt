00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,849
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:04,500
is China gaming bitcoin?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,620
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,620
Bitcoin!

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,150
The money of the future.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,150
Maybe.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,250
Or it could all crash and burn.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,140
Depends who you ask.

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,360
For those of you unfamiliar with it,

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,820
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,159
Which is not how this guy pays you for dinner.

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,560
Cryptocurrency uses cryptography

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,229
to secure its transactions

15
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:32,630
and to create more of the currency.

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,860
Cryptography secures information in code,

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,030
like the famous Enigma machines

18
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,580
used by the Nazis during World War II.

19
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,080
Nowadays, cryptography is done by computers

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,820
using incredibly complex math.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,560
Which unlike the Enigma code,

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,810
can't be solved by Britain's greatest minds,

23
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,960
Sherlock Holmes and Elizabeth Swann.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,540
Modern cryptography lets Bitcoin

25
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,930
operate independently from a central authority,

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,500
like a government or a bank,

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,550
because you don't need a third party

28
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,820
to validate the Bitcoin transaction.

29
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,360
And transactions can be done anonymously.

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,329
Bitcoin has been described as

31
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,160
the world’s most democratic currency.

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,400
So obviously it’s been thriving in—

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,540
you guessed it—

34
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
China.

35
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,620
According to Coin Telegraph,

36
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,800
“the majority of Bitcoin trading,

37
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,700
estimated from 50 percent to 98 percent,

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,899
takes place in China.”

39
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,509
This creates a problem.

40
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,219
In theory, Bitcoin can’t be controlled

41
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,429
by any government.

42
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:28,659
But in practice,

43
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,469
the Chinese Communist Party can have

44
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,799
a huge influence

45
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,469
on the global price of Bitcoin.

46
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,720
So if you own Bitcoin,

47
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,480
well, the value of your money can

48
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,289
be heavily influenced by the whims

49
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:42,920
of the world’s largest authoritarian regime.

50
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,470
Take that, democratic currency!

51
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,140
Take what happened in 2013 as an example.

52
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,899
In early September that year,

53
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,560
one Bitcoin was worth around 100 US dollars.

54
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
By late November,

55
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,539
that price had skyrocketed

56
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,959
to more than 1,000 dollars per Bitcoin.

57
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,420
And then overnight,

58
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,440
it came crashing down.

59
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,810
China’s central bank,

60
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,229
the People’s Bank of China,

61
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,200
told financial institutions in China

62
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,580
to suspend trading in Bitcoin

63
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,170
because it “doesn't have ‘real meaning’

64
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,920
and lacks legal protections.”

65
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,500
Funny that those same things

66
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,820
didn't stop the Chinese regime

67
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,660
from encouraging people to speculate

68
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,420
in China's stock markets.

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,080
But back to Bitcoin.

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,240
In two weeks,

71
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,890
Bitcoin lost over half its value.

72
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,890
It took a full year

73
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,320
before the price bottomed out.

74
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
Something similar happened again

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
in February this year.

76
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,370
The People’s Bank of China met with

77
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,030
three of China’s biggest Bitcoin exchanges,

78
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,760
BTC China, Huobi, and OKCoin.

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
The exchanges then stopped Bitcoin withdrawals

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
for four months.

81
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
The exchanges recently lifted the ban,

82
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,000
but during the suspension,

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,430
the global price of Bitcoin

84
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,630
dropped again,

85
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,360
though not as much as in 2013.

86
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,630
So why has the Chinese regime

87
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,500
been targeting Bitcoin?

88
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,080
Besides it being a democratic currency?

89
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,180
There are a few reasons.

90
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,580
First, Chinese people can use Bitcoin

91
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,440
to get their money out of China.

92
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,820
You see, the Chinese regime has limits

93
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,160
on the amount of foreign currency

94
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,230
people in China can buy—

95
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,230
because they’re worried about

96
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,260
rich Chinese people

97
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,870
moving their money out

98
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,700
and then fleeing the country.

99
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,480
But Chinese investors can buy Bitcoin in China,

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,600
and then later exchange that for foreign currency

101
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,080
in any amount they want.

102
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,170
Huge fortunes that might have been made through,

103
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,920
I don’t know,

104
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,930
corruption,

105
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,410
could be safely stored out of reach

106
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,329
of pesky Chinese investigators.

107
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,170
And that was why China’s central bank

108
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,570
started investigating Bitcoin exchanges

109
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,950
back in February,

110
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,930
and threatened to shut down exchanges

111
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,270
that violated rules on

112
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,120
“foreign exchange management,

113
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
money laundering,

114
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,210
and payment and settlement.”

115
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,930
But it’s unclear how much money

116
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,840
is actually being moved out of China

117
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,180
through Bitcoin.

118
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,770
Bitcoin transactions in China

119
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,340
are not anonymous,

120
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,340
since you have to link

121
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
a Chinese bank card

122
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,010
to your Bitcoin account.

123
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,060
You could move a few hundred

124
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,690
thousand yuan into Bitcoin,

125
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,620
but larger amounts would attract attention.

126
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,740
So why is there so much

127
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,360
Bitcoin trading in China?

128
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, that brings us to the second reason

129
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,630
the Chinese regime is so interested

130
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,390
in Bitcoin.

131
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,560
Earlier I mentioned people speculating

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
in China's stock markets,

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
and since those markets

134
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,910
have cooled down,

135
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,910
guess where people

136
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,200
are putting their money now?

137
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,870
You see, in China,

138
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
there's not a lot of places

139
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,730
people can invest their money.

140
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,889
Which leads to things like

141
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,700
real estate bubbles.

142
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,980
Stock market bubbles.

143
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,500
And, naturally,

144
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,600
fish bladder bubbles.

145
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,940
It's like Chinese investors looked at

146
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,370
the Dutch tulip bulb craze,

147
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,370
and thought,

148
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,370
what a great idea,

149
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,600
but it needs more fish bladders.

150
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,720
Putting your money in an online cryptocurrency

151
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,900
stored on something called a blockchain

152
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,060
that can do something called forking

153
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
doesn't seem so crazy

154
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,320
now, does it?

155
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,180
Hmmm...Bitcoin or fish bladders?

156
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,280
Which will be the money of the future?

157
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,240
Anyway, speculation,

158
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
no matter the medium,

159
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,220
has the same result.

160
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,260
And many of the same things

161
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,590
that led to China's stock market collapse

162
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,070
are now happening in China's Bitcoin exchanges:

163
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
People dipping in and out

164
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,260
to make a quick buck,

165
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,139
leading to wild market fluctuations,

166
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,280
and risky margin trading.

167
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,430
Which is to say,

168
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,210
this will all end really well.

169
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,270
One of the Bitcoin investors

170
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,710
interviewed in this article

171
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,310
even says he can't lose money on Bitcoin

172
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,480
the same way he did on the stock market,

173
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,910
because Bitcoin's not controlled

174
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,900
by the Chinese regime.

175
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,570
Uhhhh....about that.

176
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,071
The third reason the Chinese Communist Party

177
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,639
has been targeting Bitcoin is control.

178
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,120
You see, the CCP is not out to kill Bitcoin—

179
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,740
at least not right now.

180
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,139
They just want to bend Bitcoin to their advantage.

181
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,620
But first, let’s talk about Bitcoin mining.

182
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,780
Simply put,

183
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,150
people can run powerful computers

184
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,330
to solve complex math problems

185
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,990
that validate Bitcoin transactions--

186
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,990
that's the cryptography

187
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,639
I was mentioning earlier--

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,800
and they're rewarded with Bitcoins.

189
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,240
This is how new Bitcoins are created.

190
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,370
But nowadays Bitcoin mining

191
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,010
requires powerful computers,

192
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,240
custom chips,

193
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,390
and lots of electricity.

194
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,390
And it turns out

195
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,730
China is home to 50 to 70 percent

196
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,520
of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations.

197
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,889
The Chinese government could, of course,

198
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,200
restrict Bitcoin mining,

199
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,520
but it doesn’t.

200
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,840
Quite the opposite.

201
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
In many instances

202
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,420
the government is actively supporting it.

203
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,240
According to Bitcoin Magazine,

204
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,669
major Bitcoin mines in China’s northwest

205
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,290
are being given, “access to government-supported,

206
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,590
low-cost wind and solar electricity.”

207
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,900
Powering the computer servers

208
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,270
is one of the biggest financial challenges

209
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,320
to Bitcoin mining.

210
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,490
The People’s Bank of China

211
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,800
could also be showing favor to Bitcoin.

212
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,990
A senior banking official

213
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,650
just recently published a detailed editorial

214
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,460
about all the advantages Bitcoin

215
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
can offer China.

216
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
Because if you look at it,

217
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,330
since China can have a huge impact

218
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,729
on the price of Bitcoin,

219
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,580
why wouldn’t the Chinese regime

220
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,680
use its influence over the market

221
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,000
to its advantage?

222
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,659
Here’s what the CCP could do.

223
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,250
Let’s say the Bank of China makes it known

224
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,880
they’ll be investigating

225
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,770
some major Bitcoin exchange.

226
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,620
Prices plummet.

227
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,770
Chinese officials then buy up Bitcoin

228
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,480
while the market is down.

229
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,510
And then they release a statement

230
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,170
that the Chinese government supports Bitcoin,

231
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,600
and the market skyrockets.

232
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Again, that’s hypothetical,

233
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,199
but very possible.

234
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,210
Following China’s investigation earlier

235
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,210
this year,

236
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,770
the price of Bitcoin, “more than [doubled]

237
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,800
to about $2,900 over the last three months.”

238
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
And on top of that,

239
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
the Chinese regime has

240
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,800
the ultimate Sword of Damocles

241
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,889
over all Bitcoin operations in China.

242
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,090
According to CNN,

243
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,870
“Chinese regulators could clamp down on
bitcoin

244
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,639
by classifying it as a foreign currency,

245
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,900
which would effectively limit

246
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,910
individual Bitcoin transactions

247
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,699
to $50,000 per year.”

248
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,040
So a lot of people feel they should buy

249
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,990
as much Bitcoin as they can right now.

250
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,820
Which will, of course, further drive up the
price.

251
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,090
Possibly making some officials very rich.

252
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,020
Of course, China is not the only influence

253
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,490
on the Bitcoin market,

254
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,990
and there are also new cryptocurrencies like Ethereum,

255
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,540
that are gaining market share.

256
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
But the Chinese regime

257
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,050
still has a pretty big effect

258
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,290
on the global price of Bitcoin.

259
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,290
Which makes me think,

260
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,820
maybe the fish bladder market

261
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,889
is the way to go.

262
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:20,889
What do you think?

263
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,389
Leave your comments below.

264
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,389
And as you know,

265
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:24,699
China Uncensored is made possible

266
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,180
almost entirely through viewer contributions

267
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,380
and support.

268
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,860
A lot of viewers have asked us

269
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,479
to set up a Bitcoin address

270
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,940
for China Uncensored—

271
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,870
and now we have.

272
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,870
The money you contribute

273
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,140
will go to improving the show,

274
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,440
like hiring staff,

275
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
buying props,

276
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
renting studio equipment,

277
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,149
investing in fish bladders and so on.

278
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,500
The link to our Bitcoin page and address is
below.

279
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
And after all,

280
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,010
if you’re putting Bitcoins into our hands,

281
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,100
it won’t be in the hands

282
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,620
of the Chinese Communist Party.

283
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,540
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

284
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,760
See you next time.
