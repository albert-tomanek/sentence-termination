1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,280
These young people,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,010
what do they feel is the downside

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,450
of having Beijing in charge?

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,570
It makes us -

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,020
It doesn’t make us stronger.

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,639
I mean the people.

7
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,309
It makes us in the fringe

8
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,249
of the game of power.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,859
I’m here in Macau,

12
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,679
China’s other Special Administrative Region.

13
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,810
Like neighboring Hong Kong,

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,349
Macau is supposed to be run under China’s

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,619
One Country, Two Systems policy.

16
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:31,890
And like with Hong Kong,

17
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,110
the one country thing is definitely true,

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,020
but the two systems part—less so.

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,190
But unlike in Hong Kong,

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,010
the democratic movement here in Macau

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,600
is small.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,690
Most people seem content

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,400
to let the Communist Party have its way

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,140
in exchange for economic prosperity.

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,431
You know that draconian anti-subversion law,

26
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,431
Article 23,

27
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,820
that half a million Hong Kongers protested
against in 2003?

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,570
Well, in Macau,

29
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,350
it was passed in 2009

30
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,940
without much fuss.

31
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
Dissidents here,

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,670
perhaps even more so than in Hong Kong,

33
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,410
are fighting an uphill battle against the
status quo.

34
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,530
So naturally,

35
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,850
I just had to come here and talk with someone

36
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,760
who shares my passion for uphill battles

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,550
against the status quo.

38
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,490
I sat down with Scott Chiang,

39
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,220
President of the New Macau Association,

40
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,260
a major pro-democracy NGO in Macau.

41
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
Thanks for joining me, Scott.

42
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,100
Why don’t you tell us about

43
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,820
the New Macau Association.

44
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,520
Well, it’s been one of the, uh,

45
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,490
People says it’s a flagship democratic association

46
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,490
in Macau.

47
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,660
I don’t know.

48
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,909
We’ve been here since the early 90s.

49
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,090
It’s founded by a bunch of

50
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,320
very passionate people

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,700
who care about the future of Macau

52
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,240
because it’s just before the handover

53
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,280
and it’s just after what happened in ’89

54
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,630
in Tainanmen Square.

55
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,990
And people genuinely concerned about our future

56
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,220
under Chinese rule.

57
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,540
Younger generation - I’m part of it -

58
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,340
emerges in the recent years,

59
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,799
and we want to make democrats - true democrats
-

60
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,760
survive in Macau in the coming generations.

61
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,319
So this organization has been around for a
long time.

62
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,829
How have you seen the situation in Macau change

63
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,279
since the handover in 1999?

64
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:18,019
Macau has been in ruins in my childhood.

65
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:23,489
The 90s is not one of our brightest hours.

66
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,010
So the expectation was low in the time of
handover.

67
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,340
This is in contrast to what happened in Hong
Kong.

68
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,980
And soon after that,

69
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,629
we have the opening up of the casino industry.

70
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,879
And that, adding up with the lot people, tourists,

71
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,090
coming from mainland China,

72
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,480
gave us what is called the Golden Decade.

73
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,680
Well now we have the GDP exceeding

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,719
many developed countries.

75
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,829
And yes, that set a lot of people very satisfied.

76
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:02,609
And that also denied a lot of chance that
we actually had

77
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,249
to fight for our own rights

78
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,499
because people said, “Oh,

79
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,779
we’re having a good time,

80
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,379
so why don’t we shut up,

81
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,330
and enjoy it while it lasts?”

82
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,510
So people feel things are better now,

83
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,689
under Communist rule?

84
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,790
Naturally.

85
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,159
And when they acknowledged

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,370
the good times come from mainland tourists,

87
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,400
and they will think again, when they try to
criticize

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,349
China or the local government, even -

89
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,079
because they know they have the endorsement
of Beijing,

90
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,299
and they know that Macau’s fate,

91
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,299
in their mind,

92
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,879
is in the hands of the privileged -

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,950
not in themselves.

94
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,909
I have to say that, sadly,

95
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:49,980
that’s the truth about many local people.

96
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,699
The younger generation are feeling

97
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,519
more strongly and strongly and strongly that

98
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,810
they need to have a say in what goes on in
their town.

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,019
So I still see hope in that.

100
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,059
These young people,

101
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,790
what do they feel is the downside

102
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,219
of having Beijing in charge?

103
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,219
It makes us -

104
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,900
It doesn’t make us stronger.

105
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,409
I mean the people.

106
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,079
It makes us in the fringe

107
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,450
of the game of power.

108
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,900
That is one of the things

109
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,639
we want to fight against.

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,859
To change people’s minds and show them,

111
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,730
no, when you fight it,

112
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,730
you may stand a chance.

113
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,159
But if you just sit home and wait,

114
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,659
nothing will happen.

115
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,259
So how does the political situation in Macau

116
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,720
compare to Hong Kong?

117
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,190
Macau has a very robust apolitical tradition,

118
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,190
so to say,

119
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,650
because not that people are not talking about
politics.

120
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,949
They do,

121
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,580
and they may know more than you might suspect.

122
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,360
But they fail to connect what is in the news

123
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,520
and what they need to do to change it.

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,680
They may be very openly criticizing Obama.

125
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,470
They may have a strong opinion against Trump.

126
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,250
But they wouldn’t be the same open and vocal,

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,650
criticizing personnel when it comes to local
politics.

128
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,819
Yes, they may complain in local cafes

129
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,130
about this and that,

130
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,490
the traffic, housing price…

131
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,610
But when you say,

132
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,110
“Hey, why don’t we do something change
that?”

133
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,419
They say, “Nah, it doesn’t work.

134
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,669
I’ve been around more than you - longer
than you.

135
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,449
And I know they don’t work.”

136
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,870
That is the general sentiment,

137
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,100
at least for the older generations.

138
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,440
And that sentiment shaped the fate of Macau

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,220
for the last decades.

140
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,300
How about the younger generation?

141
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,639
The younger generation?

142
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,360
We are more…

143
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
We are better educated.

144
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,810
And many of my friends,

145
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,330
when they have the chance to go abroad,

146
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,600
and get a job there,

147
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,180
they choose not to go back

148
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,550
because they know Macau is not suitable for
them

149
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,669
or for their offspring.

150
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,620
But for those who return,

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,199
I believe there is hope in them because

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,879
when they had the chance,

153
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,930
and they choose to return to their hometown,

154
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,560
I expect more from them when it comes to,

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,879
you know,

156
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,599
changing the place for the better.

157
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,379
So how has the implementation of Article 23
in 2009

158
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,379
changed Macau?

159
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,689
Well, may I disappoint you in saying, “business
as usual?”

160
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,039
Sometimes even we didn’t realize,

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,210
oh, it’s already here

162
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,439
for quite some years.

163
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,020
Yeah, the thing is, when you talk to people
saying,

164
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,680
“Oh, this law is bad because it

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,560
diminished civil liberty,

166
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,439
it gives the administration too much power,

167
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,719
it makes criminal charges against, you know,

168
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,860
freedom of speech -“

169
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,069
And people say, “what are you afraid of,

170
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,800
if you’re not going to overthrow Beijing?”

171
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,720
Nonetheless, it is harmful to civil society.

172
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,909
But pretty much nobody listened,

173
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,580
unlike in Hong Kong.

174
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,330
So do you think Macau still has

175
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,590
the One Country, Two System policy?

176
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,169
In the first part, I’m pretty confident.

177
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,469
And I understand you were recently interviewed
by police

178
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,150
after a protest earlier this year.

179
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,580
Which interview do you mean?

180
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
How many?

181
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
Are you concerned for your safety?

182
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,290
I lost count, actually.

183
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,699
Am I safe in this room?

184
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,650
Should I be seen with you?

185
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,370
Well, you film it.

186
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,240
I guess that’s true.

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,580
I should’ve thought about that.

188
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,620
No, as I told you,

189
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,900
we were relatively safe,

190
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,340
or not worried by those up there

191
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,020
because we are weak

192
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,110
in comparison to our counterparts in Hong
Kong.

193
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,219
We do not constitute a critical minority in
the house

194
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,960
of legislation.

195
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,979
And we don’t mobilize as much as those in
Hong Kong.

196
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,469
And how do you feel about that perceived weakness?

197
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:02,370
It is not just “perceived.”

198
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,849
It is backed by hard fact.

199
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:10,840
And that is both a blessing and curse, right?

200
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,090
Being weak is not a good thing,

201
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,270
but then it kinda protected you from a lot
of attacks.

202
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,400
And oftentimes we think to ourselves,

203
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,990
“Have we been doing the utmost that we can
do?”

204
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,220
We are pretty much the leading democrats in
Macau.

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,250
There’s not much competition there.

206
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,240
Is it because we are doing good enough,

207
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,690
or is it because it’s not a very attractive

208
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,150
career path?

209
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,030
Then we have to remind ourselves that we have
to

210
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,040
do better than we have been.

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,980
Being weak can be a motivation.

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,680
What is your hope for the future of Macau?

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,030
Well as I told you,

214
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,240
the younger generation has a lot of potential.

215
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,560
Information is easier to obtain now.

216
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,680
It’s harder to keep your people blind and
deaf

217
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,700
from what’s happening outside.

218
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,690
And what’s happening in Hong Kong and Taiwan
has been a

219
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,080
very, very, very visual alarm

220
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,560
for people in Macau.

221
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,850
Some people will take that as an alert,

222
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,580
saying “we shall not move to that direction.

223
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,250
Macau is no place for extremists.”

224
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,190
But then younger generation will see opportunities,

225
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,600
saying we may not need to do the same thing,

226
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,850
but we can, nonetheless, take things into
our own hands

227
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,880
instead of putting it up to somebody else.

228
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,180
Well thank you again.

229
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
That was Scott Chiang,

230
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,720
president of the New Macau Association.

231
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,400
Thank you - thank you.
