1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,050
on this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,970
Chinese officials say Christian symbolism
has crossed the line

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,140
Oh, that's terrible

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,090
hi welcome to China uncensored

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,809
I'm your host Chris Chappell

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,840
you know there are a lot of misconceptions
about China

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,250
floating around out there these days

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,510
like some people have come up with the idea
that

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,539
just because China's Constitution guarantees
religious freedom

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,890
people in China are guaranteed religious freedoms

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,520
come on where does it say that?

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,010
no, religion is serious business in China

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,490
first of all the ruling communist party is
officially atheist

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,230
and if you want to be a member you have to
be atheist too

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,390
there are also only five officially recognized
religions

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,120
Protestantism Catholicism Buddhism Taoism
and Islam

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
sorry Jews

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,450
now obviously the situation in China has improved

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,270
since the days of the Cultural Revolution

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,300
when the monasteries and temples were being
burned

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,360
and the priesthood exiled or killed

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,120
but according to this year's report

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,260
by the u.s.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,680
Commission on International Religious Freedom

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,610
the Chinese regime's suppression of Christians
in 2014

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,350
is even worse than in the previous year

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,450
it says Christians continue to face arrests,
fines, lengthy prison sentences

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,420
and of course the bulldozing of churches

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,590
now as you might imagine chinese officials
were

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,480
none too pleased with that report

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,570
they said it was full of arbitrary and unfounded
criticisms of China

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,240
so let's take a look at those arbitrary criticisms

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,810
according to a report last month by China
aid

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,070
a non-profit international christian human
rights organization

35
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:50,210
there was a 150% rise in cases of persecution
against Christians in the past year

36
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,940
almost 3,000 Christians were detained and
1300 sentenced

37
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,620
it's the worst persecution of chinese christians
in a decade

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,049
and a lot of these cases are related

39
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,909
to the so-called three rectifications and
one demolition campaign

40
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,280
by the Zhejiang provincial government

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,289
the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province

42
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,319
has been called the Chinese Jerusalem

43
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,790
because so many of its residents are Christian

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,700
but local officials are trying to make their
presence a lot less visual

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,170
the three rectifications and one demolition
campaign is in theory

46
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,050
geared towards removing illegal structures

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,220
but in reality the illegal structures on the
lists

48
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,430
are all pretty much churches and temples

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,840
and by "one demolition" they mean

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,650
hundreds and hundreds of crosses and scores
of churches

51
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,650
but who's counting

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,770
yep. what's that Shelley?

53
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,220
oh the commission on international religious
freedom is counting?

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,080
ok that number is in fact more than 400 last
year

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,670
for example, the SanJiang church in WenZhou

56
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,040
which took 12 years and 4.7 million dollars
in donations to build

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
was demolished in one night

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,880
I mean yes thousands of the churches' members
tried to stop it

59
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,459
but a good number of them were arrested

60
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,300
and the thing is it was a state-sanctioned
church

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,730
that was even lauded by the local government

62
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,640
for being a model engineering project

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,340
a deeper problem is that technically

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,950
all the land in China belongs to the Communist
Party

65
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,700
so whenever they decide they want you off

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,989
it can lead to some pretty awkward situations

67
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,650
wave after wave of churches have been demolished

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,849
or have had their crosses torn down

69
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,660
because nothing says illegal structure like
a cross on a rooftop

70
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,989
though that eye of sauron they're building
in Beijing is a beauty

71
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,879
and of course as with any construction project

72
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,160
it's reasonable to assume that some crosses

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,629
will spontaneously burst into flames

74
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,270
I mean it is construction

75
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,090
but people, come on, the Chinese Constitution
guarantees religious freedom

76
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,980
ZheJiang officials just have a few little
suggestions on how to handle the crosses

77
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,129
let's see

78
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,090
crosses must be placed on the facades of buildings

79
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,410
not above them

80
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,590
they must be of a color that blends into the
building

81
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,260
not one that stands out

82
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,989
and they must be small

83
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,230
no more than one tenth the height of the building's
facade

84
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,780
and of course if your church's cross doesn't
meet

85
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,779
those perfectly reasonable requirements

86
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,779
it will be torn down

87
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,909
like in my catholic high school

88
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:28,139
when they announced that we were no longer
allowed to have facial hair

89
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,969
and then they came into our bedrooms

90
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,949
in the middle of the night and ripped off
our beards

91
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,759
now unsurprisingly officials have met some
resistance from Christians

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,830
in the regions

93
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,110
but they decided to take the high road

94
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,210
instead of lowering themselves to the level
of

95
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,539
rationally explaining their actions

96
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,169
they just arrested people

97
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,349
I mean arresting Christians worked out pretty
well for the Romans

98
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,819
why shouldn't it work for the chinese government
too?

99
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,089
last year 50 people from a Protestant church
in Zhejiang

100
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,249
protested the planned removal of their churches'
cross

101
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,180
the police beat them

102
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,400
after that a pastor named Huang Yizi from
another state sanctioned church

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,509
gathered a group together to appeal to authorities

104
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,309
and get an explanation for the violence

105
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:17,069
this sort of appeal to officials is quite
common in China actually

106
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,759
the official term for it is apparently

107
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,460
gathering crowds together to disturb social
order

108
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,979
Huang was sentenced to a year in prison and
the cross was torn down anyway

109
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,639
now this is not as heavy-handed as it sounds

110
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,330
originally they were planning on putting Huang
in jail for 10 years

111
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,080
so really they're being quite lenient

112
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,509
so what do you think of the attacks on Christians
and crosses in China?
