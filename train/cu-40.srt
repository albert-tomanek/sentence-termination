1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:02,129
Uyghur ex-officials

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,450
Are given the death sentence
Over a Uyghur textbook

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,449
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,480
It’s no longer a secret that China is giving
“special treatment” to ethnic minorities

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,240
like the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,590
In the last few months, countries around the
world have started calling that special treatment

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,780
genocide.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,839
And last month, the US and its allies sanctioned
Chinese officials for genocide.

9
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:40,980
“Genocide” includes separating Uyghur
families and throwing them into concentration

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,149
camps.

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,890
Or forcing birth control on Uyghur women to
suppress the population.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,589
And let’s not forget killing Uyghurs and
harvesting their organs.

13
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:54,350
And then there’s the cultural genocide.

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,469
Like silencing the Uyghur language.

15
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:02,129
For example, in the internment camps, Uyghurs
are forced to speak Mandarin and not their

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,370
native language.

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,550
You see this?

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,880
Why this is just a language class.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,440
Today’s lesson: How to say “Thank you
Chinese Communist Party, for giving me all

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,450
of this free re-education.”

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,460
But it’s not enough for Uyghurs, including
Uyghur children, to learn Mandarin.

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,740
They also need to learn Chinese Communist
Party propaganda, with a hearty dose of historical

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,570
revisionism.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,820
What happens if they’re not learning to
love the motherland?

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,680
The death sentence.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,850
The Chinese regime has recently handed death
sentences to Uyghur former officials for “writing

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,310
and publishing school textbooks designed to
‘split the country’”.

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,890
Two former education officials were given
suspended death sentences, while five more

29
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,230
Uyghurs, including book editors, were given
long prison sentences, some up to life in

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,700
prison.

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:05,060
Now in China, a suspended death sentence means
it could be changed to life in prison instead.

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,020
Which is the...good news?

33
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,310
So what were these men’s crimes?

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,480
They were accused of adding separatist ideas
to Uyghur language textbooks for elementary

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,500
and secondary school kids, starting in 2002.

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,880
Those textbooks were then used in Xinjiang
for more than a decade—before authorities

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,890
changed their minds in 2016, and decided they
were in fact separatist books that harm young

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,890
people.

39
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,080
“25 million copies of the textbook were
printed and distributed in Xinjiang.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,120
And tens of thousands of Uyghur educators
have used it for 13 years, causing extremely

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
serious harm.”

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,510
The son of one of the imprisoned book editors
pushed back on the Chinese regime’s claims.

43
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,069
He points out that these textbooks were approved
by the state for 13 years.

44
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,040
And he says “China is trying to erase history
and write a new narrative.”

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Whaaaaat?

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,520
Erasing history and writing a new narrative?

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Does that sound like something the Chinese
Communist Party would do?

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,020
But the Party is going even further to rewrite
the history of Xinjiang.

49
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,450
I’ll show you how after the break.

50
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,150
Welcome back.

51
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,660
Former Uyghur education officials have been
thrown in prison for an old textbook featuring

52
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,540
no-longer-approved history.

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,709
And now Chinese state run CGTN has released
a documentary film about them—a full hour

54
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,380
of villainizing these “two-faced” Uyghurs.

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,070
Murat Sheripjan says even the term “two-faced”
doesn’t properly describe such persons.

56
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,170
They are the enemy, the enemy in the shadows”

57
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,080
The documentary of course includes televised
forced confessions from these “enemies in

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
the shadows.”

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:13,110
The idea was to use the power given by the
Party and the people to spread our ethnic

60
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,920
chauvinist sentiments and extremist errors
among more Uyghur people.

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,060
It was meant to control their minds, influence
them in childhood in order to turn them into

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,980
separatists.By framing these Uyghur officials
as hardened criminals, Chinese state-run media

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,590
is attempting to justify the Party’s genocide
of the Uyghur people.

64
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,320
They had to do it to fight terrorism, guys.

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,220
Terrorism like, showing a medal worn by a
historical figure.

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,770
Take this graphic for example.

67
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,850
The national emblem is that of East Turkistan.

68
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,420
It shouldn’t appear in textbooks at all.

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,860
The East Turkestan Republic was a short-lived
state that occupied the upper west region

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,560
of Xinjiang briefly from 1944-1949.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,010
The man pictured in the textbook was one of
the presidents of the East Turkestan Republic.

72
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,120
But no one is supposed to know that.

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,010
We shouldn’t be teaching this history at
all!

74
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,940
Especially since, according to Chinese state-run
media, there has never even been an East Turkestan

75
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
state.

76
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,370
Really, it’s much safer for society if children
lose all connection with their cultural roots.

77
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,790
This is the legend of seven heroic Uyghur
girls.

78
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,600
It’s all fabricated.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:40,580
Han Chinese soldiers trapped them at a cliff
and they jumped to their death to defend their

80
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
homeland.

81
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,210
It’s meant to incite ethnic hatred and it
will misinform the students.

82
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,120
Look, everyone knows that the only true Chinese
history is the one where the Han Chinese are

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,870
the heroes.

84
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,900
The documentary claims that these Uyghur textbooks
are directly responsible for what the documentary

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,650
refers to as the July 5th Incident.

86
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,900
But the outside world calls the July 5th Incident
the “Urumqi Massacre”—because Chinese

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,770
soldiers massacred people!

88
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,710
It happened after ethnic riots broke out in
Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, in 2009.

89
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,199
“According to witness reports, an estimated
1000 or more people, most of them ethnic Uyghurs,

90
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,910
were shot dead during that one and a half
hour period of time.”

91
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,930
And after massacring a bunch of Uyghurs, the
Chinese Communist Party imprisoned thousands

92
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,979
more.

93
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,979
And they locked down the entire Xinjiang region
for months—including cutting off the internet

94
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,139
entirely.

95
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,350
But maybe the Chinese Communist Party is onto
something here.

96
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,770
Children’s books are definitely the main
source of terrorism and separatism.

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,419
And the only solution is to lock up an entire
ethnic group.

98
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,330
At least until the Chinese regime writes new
children’s books.

99
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,270
Like “Horton Hears a Separatist and Reports
Him to the Neighborhood Committee.”

100
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,380
“Where the Wild Splittists Are.”

101
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,919
“James and the Giant Hegemon.”

102
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,530
Or my personal favorite, “Oh the Re-educational
Places You’ll Go!”

103
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,710
See, with these two-faced officials safely
behind bars, the Chinese Communist Party can

104
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,440
finally lead the Uyghurs to a brighter future,
with patriotic children’s textbooks.

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,310
This is Part One of the first grade’s Uyghur-language
textbook.

106
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,470
Here's the national emblem, and the national
flag, and the statement “We are Chinese”.

107
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,220
Here is the flag-raising ceremony.”

108
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,600
What are we telling the students with these
pictures?

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:57,070
They should know that they are citizens of
the People’s Republic of China, that Xinjiang

110
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:06,430
is an inalienable part of the motherland.”

111
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,539
What a happy ending.

112
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,650
Everything is rectified.

113
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,150
And the Uyghur children can learn to dance
like the happy ethnic minority they’re supposed

114
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,360
to be.

115
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,050
Which means it’s a perfect time to watch
China’s new hit musical inspired by the

116
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,009
Hollywood movie La La Land.

117
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:30,710
It’s called “The Wings of Songs”, and
showcases the beautiful rich life of ethnic

118
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,710
minority groups in Xinjiang.

119
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,890
Including all of their happy ethnic dancing.

120
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,779
I mean, it totally works.

121
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:44,300
It’s just like the Sound of Music, but in
the end Captain Von Trapp joins the Nazis.

122
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,060
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent

123
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,810
Army—fans who support the show on the crowd
funding website Patreon.

124
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:00,040
Ringleader asks, “Hey Chris, how would "Xi
the Poo" react if the U.S. and/or the U.K.

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,060
established a full embassy and/or military
base in the free and independent country of

126
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,480
Taiwan?”

127
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,500
Well I know how they would feel.

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,890
The feelings of the Chinese people would be
deeply hurt.

129
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,150
What would the Communist Party do about it?

130
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,230
Right now, there’s not a whole lot they
can do.

131
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,530
They would make a big stink about it.

132
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,350
The Foreign Affairs ministry would make all
kinds of statements, there’d be angry tweets.

133
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,860
And you know what, there might even be some
sanctions.

134
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,560
Some US officials might not be allowed to
travel to China anymore.

135
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,690
I also imagine there would be a continuation
of military maneuvers around Taiwan, that

136
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,770
would quietly shrink over time.

137
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,940
Because even though Xi Jinping might say the
US and China are equal now...

138
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,060
...the truth is a little different.

139
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:56,510
However, if the US shows weakness, and the
Chinese regime is able to take over Taiwan,

140
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,620
the power would shift.

141
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,470
If the Chinese regime manages to even partially
replace the US dollar with its own currency,

142
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,850
the power will also shift.

143
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,830
We just did a full episode about that.

144
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,279
The Communist Party’s goal is to replace
the US as the world’s biggest superpower.

145
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,810
There’s still time to stop that from happening.

146
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,790
But not a lot of time.

147
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,640

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,440
