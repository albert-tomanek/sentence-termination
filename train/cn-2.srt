Today's show is sponsored by
Marilyn Manson's Fancy Dancin'.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,920
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We are playing Citation Needed.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,360
I have an almost-randomly selected article from Wikipedia in front of me

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,080
and these folks can't see it.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,960
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,280
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers which is...

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,900
Now, sometimes the random article selector

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,620
comes out with something that I definitely can't use.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Sometimes it comes out with something wonderful.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,500
And sometimes it comes out with something like...

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
The Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,400
[Laughter]

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,300
'Neck a vest' is when you get a pint of vest

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,740
and just try and try and down it.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,040
Warming!

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,420
Nekavestnominate!

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,200
Actually, I found out what the German for 'neknominate' was,

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
and it's 'Biernominierung'.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,480
ALL: Ahhh!

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,020
Yes!

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,480
It's got a lovely... Biernominierung.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,560
Yeah, it's got that kind of assonance in it that really really sells it.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,640
'Neknominate'... enh.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,800
'Ich Biernominierung Hans!' It still works.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,360
— Yeah.
— It still works.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,840
Ohh, 'neck vest'.

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,480
Neckarwestnominate: you have to build a nuclear power plant in your back garden.

28
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,620
I was thinking you'd just have to wear a really bad sweater for the next day.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,820
Really tight '80s tank top. That kind of thing.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,020
Sorry, it just occurs to me that Starfleet spandex uniforms

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
don't really fit all body types. There's just...

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,940
That's a fair point! You never saw a fat Starfleet captain, did you?

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,820
That's what I was thinking.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,340
What about Scotty?

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,580
No, but he didn't wear, like, the first version Next Generation ones,

36
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,600
you know, the *really* tight 'you can see their junk' level ones.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
Oh yeah, they did fit, didn't they?

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,940
Can you imagine being a bit of a chunkier fellow in one of them?

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,400
Just the gut hanging out.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,380
I suspect that enough TNG conventions have brought us this image.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,120
'I've split my uniform, sir.'

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,980
— '...again.'
— 'Again.'

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,880
[Sad trombone]

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,500
Are you just improvising a '70s sitcom on board the USS Enterprise?

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Carry On Enterprise! Yeah.

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,300
Oh, actually that would have been really good.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah! Carry On Star Trek could actually have been a thing.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,820
It's around about the right time.

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,280
Goodness, I'm glad we're riffing on this,

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,180
because frankly Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant doesn't...

51
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
[Laughter]
...doesn't have that much in the way of —

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,400
Is it in Russia?

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
No, it's in Germany.

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,260
Can anyone tell me its nameplate capacity?

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,960
Nameplate capac... Nameplate?!

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,140
They could have fit dozens and dozens of nameplates in there,

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,000
but that lousy nuclear fuel...

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Why are you putting name badges into a nuclear reactor?

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,860
That sounds like the worst thing you could do!

60
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,680
Fifty nameplates per square metre.

61
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,060
When you've got a name like that, it must go right to the edge of the...

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm imagining this place looks exactly like the one off Thunderbirds.

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,660
It's got a big circular sphere thing in the middle,

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,080
and with a name that long it's going all the way around the edge.

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,880
Literally — I'm giving you a point. That is pretty much exactly what it looks like.

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,140
Hahey!

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Does anyone want to tell me what 'nameplate capacity' is?

68
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,020
— Why don't *you*?
— I'd thought it was the power output.

69
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,540
— No! Name...
— Yeah! Point. [DING]

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,240
Is it?

71
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,940
It's the nominal capacity.
It's the maximum it can put out, sustained.

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,020
It's — to use your Star Trek reference again — maximum warp.

73
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh! I see.

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,400
About 2.2 gigawatts.

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,000
— Of course! Argh! Just what I was going to say.
— Yes!

76
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,520
It's hard to generate interesting questions about nuclear power plants.

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
Let's go a bit more generically.

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,400
What would happen if you wee in the reactor?

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,540
That's an interesting question about a nuclear power plant right there.

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,840
Your dick falls off.

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Into the coolant, in which the...

82
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,220
Into the reactor via a pipe.

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,480
Okay? I'm not talking about opening the top up and just weeing in there.

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,980
I know exactly that a jet of neutrons will come out

85
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,720
and turn my dick into Godzilla, or something like that, right?

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm... I mean, I'm imagining it's just...

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,100
ROAR!

88
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,880
It's such a brilliant image, I'm sorry!

89
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,780
I think we should all just take a breath,

90
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,080
and appreciate that what we're actually seeing

91
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,080
is a remake of Godzilla, just with a tiny Brannan

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,760
— perched somewhere very high in the shot.
— [Screams]

93
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,700
Going, 'Oh ****, I shouldn't have pissed in...'

94
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,280
'however-you-pronounce-it Nuclear Reactor.'

95
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,340
'No, no, don't destroy Tokyo! We need that...!'
'ROAAAR!'

96
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,880
You'd look like an amazing Rod Hull and Emu.

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,180
What if Rod Hull had pissed into a nuclear reactor?! Would Emu have come real?

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
No!
[Laughter]

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Would the emu have become welded to his arm and sentient?

100
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,020
Folks, if we do have any experts in nuclear physics watching...

101
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,040
'Help me!'

102
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Or indeed in Rod Hull.

103
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,260
Yeah.

104
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,180
Just... do tell us what would happen.

105
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,640
I mean, I'm imagining it would be basically like

106
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,740
pissing on the stones in a sauna, only a thousand times worse.

107
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,840
[Steam sounds]
— Yeah.

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,340
And then, if you have got an emu on your hand, it comes real. Right?

109
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,480
[Laughter]
You've basically got a cloud...

110
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,220
If you have the foresight to bring an emu with you.

111
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Which I would, naturally!

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,520
...a cloud of radioactive piss-steam,

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
— essentially, is what comes out there.
— Ha!

114
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,440
Also, if you've got a real emu, and your hand up its arse,

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,780
it turns into a puppet.

116
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,960
— Ohh!
— It cuts both ways.

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Science is amazing!

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,760
So anyway, this nuclear power plant.

119
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,180
Yes. How long has it been operating?
(I'm just naming questions.)

120
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,760
Since '54.

121
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
All right. Okay. Let me have a go, let me have a go.

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,560
This is looking like something out of Thunderbirds.

123
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,680
Yep. And it's a West German nuclear power plant.

124
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,040
And it's in West Germany, so — that's fine, because it's been influenced

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,760
by American and British technology of the time in nuclear reactors,

126
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,560
which is what? Influenced Gerry Adam —

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,640
Not Gerry Adams! Gerry Anderson!

128
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,080
Gerry Adams' Thunderbirds!

129
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,520
— We're on dangerous territory here, lads.
— WHOA, everybody!

130
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,340
I wasn't going to say anything more to follow that.

131
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,060
I was going to let it run all on its own!

132
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,840
I was just assuming...

133
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,500
During the '80s their voices were provided by actors.

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,120
[Laughter]
Yes.

135
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
I was thinking the entire series as being silhouetted,

136
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,140
like The Hood in the opening credits. It just never comes out of it.

137
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Oh, s***!

138
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,060
...Gerry *Anderson* would have been influenced by.

139
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,360
So I'm going to say, 19... 59, 1960?

140
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,220
I said '54.

141
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,200
Er, '63. Why not.

142
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,220
You're closest. Point. '71. [DING]

143
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,940
— Yes!
— Argh!

144
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,460
Closest without going over!

145
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,040
W*****!

146
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Which was late enough that it got what?

147
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,040
That earlier power plants may not have had?

148
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,260
Safety! And protection.

149
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,840
Yeah, it's got to be something like that.

150
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,460
Following Windscale, yeah. Yeah.

151
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,140
A ribbon to open it with.

152
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,980
Er, it was more something that they wouldn't have wanted.

153
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,000
Protest.

154
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,520
Protest! [DING] Protest. Have a point.

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,180
Absolutely right. Blocked the entrance with an eight-metre wall.

156
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,860
Oh, fair p—
A wall?

157
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,460
Yes.

158
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,300
— They don't just appear.
— A wall of...?

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Literally, a wall of breeze blocks that they brought with them.

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,940
What do you mean, brought — bollocks!

161
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,720
Good on — that's some classic protest! I like that.

162
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
Yeah, but how long is it —

163
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,680
Whoa, whoa. Eight-metre-long.

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
Not eight-metre-high.

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,400
Ahhh.

166
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,820
Just over the entrance road, yeah.

167
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,000
— Still pretty cool.
— I'm gonna say.

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Yeah, that's a pretty good protest.

169
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,580
Like, we're not going to chain *ourselves* down...

170
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,640
Because I've got to say, there's some security guard that's sat there,

171
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,660
sipping his, I don't know, his schnapps or coffee or whatever, going —

172
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,460
Schnapps?!
[Laughter]

173
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,540
I don't think security guards on nuclear power stations

174
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,640
are allowed schnapps.

175
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
It might be cold.

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
They're looking outside, someone's building a wall...

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
'Hmm. Better do something about that soon.'

178
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,140
[Drunken singing]

179
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,000
You know. You could easily just come out and go,

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
'Hey, hey, hey. Leave it. Leave it. Don't do that. Put it down.'

181
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,620
There is an international market for electricity.

182
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,500
Every time EastEnders ends, we have to buy in power from the continent

183
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,840
and bring it over to the UK.

184
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,400
And French nuclear power stations have to

185
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,280
stick another rod of uranium on, or something, I don't know.

186
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,320
[Laughter]
I don't think...!

187
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,900
— Just into a frying pan!
— Stick another log on!

188
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,520
I think that's how it works! I'm not a scientist, but I...

189
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,540
Ainsley Harriott's Nuclear Power.
'I'll bang it in there, it's lovely.'

190
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,220
'Just bring another nuclear rod in from the shed, would you?'

191
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,700
— 'I think it's going to get cold.'
— 'Yeah, all right.'

192
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Have you got the schnapps? It's cold out there.
[Laughter]

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,560
Mind you, you're saying this...

194
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,780
I went to York's nuclear bunker

195
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,020
ALL: Oooh!

196
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,360
...the other day. I went and did the tour.

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,900
And one major gripe: the guy doing the tour pronounced it 'nucular'.

198
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
[Groans]

199
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
That aside — very, very interesting.

200
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,780
Is this the one with the sign that says 'Secret Nuclear Bunker — This Way'?

201
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,660
Yeah. It says.

202
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,180
Right next to the windmill as well. I had a brilliant day.

203
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,720
I had a tourist's tourist's tour of Holgate.

204
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
— Windmills and bunkers!
— Windmills and bunkers.

205
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,660
That's like Bedknobs and Broomsticks...

206
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,580
[Laughter]
...only more about power generation.

207
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,980
But it turns out, they didn't have NBC suits.

208
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,040
Er... Nuclear, Biological, Chemical.

209
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,200
They didn't have the standard protection suits.

210
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,300
So what you've got is a hundred and eighty civilians,

211
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,880
trained to run this place in the event of nuclear attack.

212
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,260
The first sixty to get there would be allowed in.

213
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
The other hundred and twenty were told,
'Go home to your families; enjoy dying.'

214
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,060
Wow.

215
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm imagining that looking like a rather grimmer version of It's A Mad, Mad World.

216
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh yeah.

217
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,560
Sixty. That's not many.

218
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,480
No. The sixty that are in there can only survive for thirty days;

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,980
work a hot bed system, twenty hours each;

220
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,240
don't have NBC suits to go up on the roof to check the readings;

221
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,940
the thing can't survive a direct hit, which is anywhere within twelve miles;

222
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,560
Oh.

223
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,420
...and these are the volunteers. These are the people that *want* to be there.

224
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,440
It's full of mechanical equipment...

225
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,960
so the police had a list of engineers,

226
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,540
which they would randomly select from,

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,180
and at this point it all goes a bit Soviet Russia.

228
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,880
Because the police go, and invite them to join, and come and help,

229
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,200
and if they say no, they're arrested, and they go along to help anyway.

230
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,420
Wow.

231
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,460
I'd just go straight to the 'arrested', personally.

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Yeah. 'There's two ways we can do this...'

233
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,940
But it's the thought of everyone pelting in,

234
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,660
in various methods of technology...

235
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,200
Yeah, and the sixty-first person just...

236
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
— 'Darrrgh!'
— 'Ooooh!'

237
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,640
'Doooh!'

238
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,780
It seems wrong to have this as a farce in my head,

239
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,420
but in my head, the door closes, it just kind of...

240
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,540
— Bonk!
— Yeah.

241
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,200
Bounces back down the steps, yeah?

242
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,040
Either that or the last person runs in and reaches out,

243
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,980
and pulls his hat back in before the door shuts.

244
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,460
It's really weird as well, because they do the tours on an hourly basis,

245
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,760
or an hour-and-a-quarter basis,

246
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,160
and if you're not there when they go in, you're not allowed in.

247
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
They go and close off the spiked top fence,

248
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,060
then they close the blast door behind you, and you go and do the tour.

249
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,600
So when we come out, having had —

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,460
you know, it's seriously paranoic down there.

251
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,420
— Yeah.
— It's weird, it's like...

252
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,760
This was never used. This is the weirdest ******* **** I've... eugh!

253
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,240
This is strange. This should be a film set, it's not.

254
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,740
And you go back out and you open the blast doors,

255
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,600
and there's all these people on the fence just waiting to be let in for the next tour!

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,300
[Laughter]
Aaaa! Aaa! It's like Threads! It's like Threads happened!

257
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,880
It's Threads turned up to eleven.

258
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,140
If you guys are around on a different Sunday,

259
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,320
because we're going to be busy tomorrow,

260
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,580
You'll — well, you'll hate it, but you'll all love it, I'm sure. It's great.

261
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,600
No! No! No! Because it'll make me think of Threads!

262
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,280
Yeah!

263
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,700
Speaking of that bunker tour, they're still doing...

264
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,800
well, they *were* still doing tours around the Chernobyl site.

265
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,400
— Yes.
— Yeah.

266
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,740
Well, it's slowly becoming more acceptable to go in there.

267
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,840
But the roof's about to cave in there...

268
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,820
— they haven't finished fixing it, so.
— Oh, no, no, no...

269
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,840
— Not in terms of fallout, I mean...
— Yeah.

270
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,960
20,000 years or whatever before it's habitable.

271
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,720
But the restrictions around it are slowly slackening so that you can go in.

272
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,040
Yeah. What was a pretty impossible tourist destination ten years ago

273
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,800
is... they were doing package tours five years ago,

274
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,540
and now it's got to the point where they're opening it for filming...

275
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,960
They're just letting people in.

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,500
And it's always been kind of a porous border anyway,

277
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,340
— because locals could just come in.
— Yeah.

278
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,780
Some of their people are still living there.

279
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
— Yeah.
— Yeah, some people refused to move.

280
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,980
Wildlife's thriving.

281
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,960
— Oddly.
— Oddly. Weirdly.

282
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,460
So, you know what?

283
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,100
Fling another nuclear rod on, it seems like it's fine!

284
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,620
Stick another rod on the barbie.

285
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,300
[Laughter]
I was just thinking that.

286
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,320
Just to drag it back to being silly...

287
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

288
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Obviously, the bunker in York is one of the big command centre bunkers.

289
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes!

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,020
And it was decommissioned and whatever else...

291
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,480
Was it an RSG?

292
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,400
To use the technical terminology — Regional Seat of Government?

293
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,060
No, that was the bunker over the road.

294
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,120
Which is now gone and is now a modern-built block of flats, but it was near there.

295
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,940
Not as big as the Harrogate one, because obviously that's the...

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
— the backup national one or whatever.
— Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,660
But yeah. There's like thirty or sixty of these bigger ones, with the sixty people

298
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,220
who get to wait for thirty days to go outside and die, but anyway.

299
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,840
And they've been sold off or whatever else.

300
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,620
One of them, you can paintball in.

301
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,540
ALL: Ohhh!

302
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,280
And obviously, on top of this, there's all the little three-man ones

303
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,100
that are out in the hills and around.

304
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,320
The Royal Observer post ones, yeah.

305
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah. They're being sold off as real estate.

306
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,140
Yeah. It's all ROC...

307
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
— Can you?!
— Yeah.

308
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,500
The nearest one for us is in Fulford, and it's somebody's wine cellar.

309
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,040
Ohhh, yes!

310
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,360
And there are also people who will do package tours,

311
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,960
where the three of you can go and be in this hole

312
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,440
for three or four days, for a watch cycle of the ROC.

313
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,900
Next filming location!

314
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Three of us cooped up in one location for an entire weekend?

315
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,880
I'd go spare anyway.

316
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,120
Can you imagine the maft?

317
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,460
[Groans]

318
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,360
Well, this is the thing about this hot bed system.

319
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,780
You've got sixty of them on eight-hour shifts, twenty at a time,

320
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
and you literally... just climb back in.

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
That's the hot bed idea.

322
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,540
And you've got a litre of water a day, so you're not going to wash with it.

323
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,340
At that point, when the world has ended...

324
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
I'd drink my own piss, quite frankly.

325
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
Oh no, there was enough to drink, just about.

326
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,120
No, he would anyway!

327
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,220
Sorry, I was tempted to end on that line.
Just cut to black...

328
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,300
...on that.

329
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,740
'I'd drink my own piss, quite frankly!'

330
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,540
[Laughter]
Thump!

331
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,460
'FIN.'

332
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,320
All right. On that...

333
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
'On that nuclear bombshell...'

334
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,180
[Groans]

335
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,940
Clarkson!!

336
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,520
Congratulations, Chris, you win this one.

337
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,780
Just for talking for the longest.

338
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,960
Just for talking for the longest, yeah.

339
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,640
But with knowledge and aplomb!

340
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,700
— A plum?
— A plum!

341
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,440
I also have other fruits!

342
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,100
A nuclear plum.

343
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,920
You've won a piece of classical music played using old military ordnance.

344
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,280
— Ah.
— That fits.

345
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
It's Pachelbel's "Cannon in D".

346
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,060
— Until next time, that's been Matt Gray...
— Bye-bye!

347
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,320
That's been Gary Brannan...

348
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,240
That's been Chris Joel...

349
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,960
'It's the end of the world as we know it.'

350
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
I've been Tom Scott. We'll see you next time.

351
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,520
Congratulations!
You made it through the wilderness and to the credits.
