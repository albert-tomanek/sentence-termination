1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,959
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:04,899
is Canada selling out to the Chinese regime?

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,379
I mean, they do have pandas, though....

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,500
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,250
Today I want to talk to you about something
very important—

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,270
Canada.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,630
Don't laugh.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,460
Because after the November elections, half
of the United States will be moving there.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,920
Which half, we’ll have to wait and see.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,660
But while Americans are contemplating

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,850
moving to Canada in droves,

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,570
it may be too late to get a spot.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,801
That's because Chinese

15
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:39,800
are already moving to Canada in droves.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,290
Including a number of corrupt Chinese officials.

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,420
So on Saturday,

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,399
Chinese premier Li Keqiang wrapped up

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,809
a historic three-day visit to Canada.

20
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,030
That's after Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,750
traveled to China earlier this month.

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,750
Li wrote:

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,030
“I am delighted to be coming today to Canada,
the beautiful land of maples.”

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,030
That's it?

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,100
That's the best he could come up with?

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,410
It’s like he just looked at the flag and
was like,

27
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,930
ok, maples.

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,780
What about "the beautiful land of poutine
and Tim Hortons,

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,280
where babies are born with ice skates on,

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,080
and handsome mounties wander the frozen tundra

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,650
with white wolves at their feet?”

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,760
Boom.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,350
Nailed it.

34
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,350
Anyway,

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,090
for years, the Chinese regime has been working hard

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,800
to get closer ties to America’s less violent
northern doppleganger.

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,920
It’s been seeking a free trade deal and
relaxed investment rules.

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,930
And importantly,

39
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,790
it’s been seeking an extradition treaty

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,200
that would allow Beijing to nab those “corrupt officials”

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,660
and send them back to China.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,970
But you see, there’s a couple problems with
that.

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,550
Look, no one likes corrupt officials.

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,259
OK, most corrupt officials.

45
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,009
So why shouldn't Canada work with China

46
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,409
to send them back and face trial?

47
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,310
Well, for one,

48
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,909
the Chinese regime labels all sorts of people
as criminals—

49
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,629
and a lot of people labeled corrupt are victims
of political purging.

50
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,629
And then, of course

51
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,400
there are those pesky dissidents who criticize
the Chinese regime.

52
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,400
Like artist Ai Weiwei.

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,090
The regime once investigated him for so-called
“economic crimes.”

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,579
And for two, the Chinese regime kills people
for corruption.

55
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,840
In China, unlike the United States,

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,499
you can be executed for economic crimes—

57
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:36,219
even embezzling just five hundred thousand
dollars.

58
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:40,650
And China’s state-controlled courts don’t
exactly give people a fair trial.

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,060
Canada, on the other hand

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,980
has generally been a world leader in human
rights.

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,620
The Chinese Communist Party’s liberal use
of the death penalty—

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,999
and liberal use of trumping up charges for
political purposes—

63
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,829
are two reasons why Canada has resisted

64
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,189
ever signing an extradition treaty with them.

65
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,599
But the Chinese regime has a way of getting
what it wants.

66
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,280
This is Canadian citizen Kevin Garratt.

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,780
He just spent two years in a Chinese prison.

68
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,340
This was after living in China for 30.

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,380
He and his wife ran a part-time Christian
aid mission,

70
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,590
giving food to starving North Koreans.

71
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,159
Or as state-run Xinhua News calls it,

72
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,479
“accepting tasks from Canadian espionage
agencies

73
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,019
to gather intelligence in China.”

74
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,049
Same difference.

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,920
That’s why Chinese authorities arrested
Garratt and his wife in 2014.

76
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,309
She was released on bail,

77
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,919
but he was charged in January with spying

78
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,419
and stealing state secrets.

79
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,670
He was convicted earlier this month,

80
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,669
then deported back to Canada

81
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,239
a week after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
visited China.

82
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,730
I wonder what happened?

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,439
I mean, the Canadian government said they made no concessions.

84
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,749
Especially not over free trade,

85
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:57,749
long-standing disputes,

86
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,290
or that extradition treaty.

87
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,280
It's just a coincidence

88
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,090
that shortly after that,

89
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,079
China and Canada are exploring free trade,

90
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,479
solving long-standing disputes,

91
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,540
and reconsidering that extradition treaty.

92
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
But what if Canada's

93
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,689
cave-in to China

94
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,559
started much earlier--

95
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,370
on a very black-and-white issue.

96
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,920
That’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

97
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,080
with two Canadian-born panda cubs.

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,449
Look at his face!

99
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,590
Who could resist those two little snugglemuffins?

100
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,090
Of course,

101
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,360
every panada in the world is technically just
on loan from China,

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,740
even the ones born overseas.

103
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,260
So wouldn’t it be a shame if they had to
go back to China?

104
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,389
Who wouldn't sign an extradition treaty

105
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,870
to keep holding those armfuls of fluffy softness?

106
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,590
Ok, I'm joking about China threatening to
repatriate the pandas,

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,270
but Chinese authorities giving countries pandas

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,020
to soften China’s political image is a real
thing.

109
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,110
It's literally called panda diplomacy.

110
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,819
So back to that extradition treaty—

111
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,779
I actually think it's not that big a deal.

112
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Why?

113
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,139
Because undercover Chinese security agents

114
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,770
have already been going into Canada,

115
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,370
and strong-arming Chinese immigrants to return
anyway.

116
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,870
But hey,

117
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,979
wouldn’t a treaty eliminate that,

118
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,189
maybe allow of the Canadian government to
have a bit more say?

119
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,650
Well, The US doesn’t have an extradition
treaty with China either—

120
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,530
for much the same concerns over human rights.

121
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
But last April,

122
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,160
the Obama administration did agree to something similar.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,550
How’d that go?

124
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,009
A Reuters investigation found the Chinese
regime

125
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,639
wasn’t really even bothering to fill out
the necessary deportation paperwork

126
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,889
when they were nabbing tens of thousands
of Chinese immigrants.

127
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,120
So who can you blame for this sorry state
of affairs?

128
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,700
Blame Canada!

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,440
Blame Canada!

130
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,560
They’re not even a real country anyway!

131
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,320
No!

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Blame the Chinese Communist Party!

133
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,270
It’s the regime that murders its own citizens
for their organs.

134
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,060
They should be viewed as an international
pariah,

135
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,849
like North Korea.

136
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,060
But because they know how to hit just the
right balance

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,159
of panda-giving and citizen-kidnapping,

138
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:21,240
while also being the world's leading manufacturer
of cheap stuff,

139
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,560
other countries just can’t seem to get enough
of them.

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,860
So what do you think about the Canadian government

141
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,400
cozying up with the Chinese regime?

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,999
Leave your comments below.

143
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,460
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

144
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,760
see you next time.

145
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,919
Something you might not know about me—

146
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,629
I have a masters degree in Classical Music
Composition

147
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,710
from New York University.

148
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,110
It was only later I decided

149
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,710
to give up such a stable career path

150
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,009
and follow my dream of undermining social
harmony in China.

151
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,009
But this weekend,

152
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,599
I get to put those old skills to use.

153
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,879
I’ll be hosting NTD’s 2016 International
Piano competition.

154
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,159
And I want you to watch.

155
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:07,439
It will be livestreamed on piano.ntdtv.com
this Saturday and Sunday,

156
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,580
October 1st and 2nd.

157
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
And who knows,

158
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,620
maybe I can convince some of the contestants
to get a real job.

159
