1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,760
what do you get when you combine

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,990
Venmo, Uber, Fandango,

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,950
and the TV screens from 1984?

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,950
Stay tuned.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,340
We’ll chat about it.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,540
Hey, good to see you again.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,030
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,400
What’s the first thing you think of

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,660
when you see this?

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,070
If you’re like me, it was,

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,090
“What is that boy doing on the moon

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,840
and what sinister plot does he have

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,660
against the Earth?!”

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,809
It turns out it’s just the login screen
for WeChat.

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,280
You might not have heard of WeChat

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
if you’re like most people

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,860
watching this show outside of China.

19
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,840
And if you’re inside of China—

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,809
what are you doing illegally watching

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,749
subversive content on YouTube?

22
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,309
Anyway, WeChat is the biggest mobile app

23
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,579
in China right now—

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,879
and one of the biggest in the world.

25
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,050
It has close to 900 million active users worldwide.

26
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,859
So what the heck is WeChat

27
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,870
and why is it so successful?

28
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,940
And should you be afraid?

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,010
Well, I’m in the media,

30
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,250
so it’s my job to make you afraid.

31
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,640
Now it’s a bit hard to describe WeChat.

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,130
That’s because there’s no app in the West

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,970
that does all the things WeChat does.

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,961
WeChat started out in 2011

35
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,240
as a basic text messaging app.

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
Today, it does basically

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,009
everything you can imagine.

38
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,619
Yes, you can chat with your friends...

39
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,430
But also, you can send them money

40
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,130
through WeChat.

41
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,260
Or pay your utility bills through WeChat.

42
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,870
Grabbing a coffee on your way to work?

43
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,960
Pay with for it with WeChat.

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,049
Rent a bicycle?

45
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,299
It’s on WeChat!

46
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,600
Or be a lazy bum and take a taxi!

47
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,820
That’s also on WeChat!

48
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,979
You can also buy tickets

49
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,820
for a high-speed rail or flight—say,

50
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,210
from Shanghai to Beijing.

51
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,210
When you arrive,

52
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,700
buy movie tickets.

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,370
Then find yourself a nice hotel.

54
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,780
All without leaving the WeChat app.

55
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,409
Wow, WeChat is so convenient!

56
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,100
It’s like having a genie in your pocket!

57
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,969
There couldn’t possibly be some kind of
horrible,

58
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,189
unforeseen catch, could there?

59
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,679
Just because WeChat knows

60
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,069
who your friends are,

61
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,590
how much money you have,

62
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,260
where you live, where you work,

63
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,340
what kind of food you like,

64
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,690
what kind of movies you watch,

65
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,830
how you like to travel,

66
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,370
and precisely where you happen to be

67
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,540
right now at this exact moment?

68
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,040
Yes, there’s an insane amount of information

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
about 900 million users

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,190
running through WeChat’s servers.

71
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,269
Oh, and guess what?

72
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,280
In order to provide you

73
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,950
with all these great services,

74
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,819
WeChat, “has full permission to activate

75
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,640
microphones and cameras,

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,180
track your location,

77
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,940
access your address book and photos,

78
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,380
and copy all of this data

79
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,629
at any time to their servers.”

80
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,540
Now it's true that Google, Apple, and Facebook

81
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,739
also collect large amounts of user data

82
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,709
and have similar permissions.

83
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,709
But in the West,

84
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,510
there are laws protecting privacy.

85
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,720
“In China, there is no such regulation.

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
On the contrary,

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,299
the national-security law

88
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,230
and the new cyber-security law

89
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,530
grant the government access

90
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,519
to almost all personal information.”

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,420
So, the horrible catch is that WeChat

92
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,020
is the television from 1984—

93
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,610
the one that’s always watching you.

94
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,550
Only it’s pocket sized,

95
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,689
and you gave it permission

96
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,620
when you signed up.

97
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,090
So what’s wrong with the Chinese government

98
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,670
and Communist Party having access

99
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,860
to all your information?

100
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,680
I think you know the answer to that,

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,130
but I’ll give you some examples anyway.

102
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,200
On this show we’ve talked about

103
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,590
how the Chinese Communist Party

104
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,340
wants to create a social ranking system

105
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,830
for every citizen by 2020.

106
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,670
“This ‘social-credit system’

107
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,370
would mobilize technology

108
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,409
to collect information on all citizens

109
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,040
and use that information to rate their behavior,

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
including financial creditworthiness

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,500
and personal conduct.”

112
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,519
Mega apps like WeChat

113
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,090
are how they’re going to do it.

114
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,150
Didn’t clock in for work on time?

115
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,910
Maybe you paid your utility bill a little
late.

116
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,910
Hmmm...

117
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,910
you’ve been having a lot of

118
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,220
doctors appointments lately.

119
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,629
And you just bought Zoloft

120
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,180
at the local pharmacy.

121
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,270
WeChat is collecting all this data.

122
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,599
And it’s required by Chinese law

123
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,830
to give it all to the government.

124
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,459
Oh, and don’t think you can

125
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,270
talk freely on WeChat

126
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,820
using its chat function.

127
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,660
WeChat censors politically sensitive topics—

128
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,750
even if you’re using WeChat outside of China.

129
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,600
That’s what Citizen Lab discovered

130
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,620
earlier this year.

131
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,009
They’re a research group

132
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,080
based at the University of Toronto.

133
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,940
Here’s a brief list of things

134
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,370
that are censored on WeChat.

135
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,940
So don’t try mentioning things like:

136
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
“Falun Gong”;

137
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,830
Or “Tiananmen June 4”;

138
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,500
Or “Free Tibet”;

139
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,660
Or the oddly specific

140
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,770
“Tough Question + Chinese Authorities Delay
Submitting

141
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,750
Supplementary Report + Avoid UN”

142
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,370
If you text someone a forbidden word

143
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,110
or combination of words,

144
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,350
those texts simply won’t go through.

145
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,140
And if that’s all that happens,

146
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,550
you’re lucky.

147
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,430
Let’s say you’re the kind of person

148
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,470
who keeps talking about Falun Gong,

149
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,500
the meditation practice is banned in China.

150
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,889
Maybe you use homophones

151
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,169
to get around the automatic censorship,

152
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,910
so your texts go through.

153
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,910
But still,

154
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,300
you’ve violated WeChat’s Terms of Service.

155
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,250
I think number 5 applies to you:

156
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,220
“Undermining national religious policy,

157
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,780
and promoting cults and feudal superstition.”

158
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,250
Case in point:

159
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,250
In Shaanxi province,

160
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,500
a Falun Gong practitioner named Cai Jinrong

161
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,940
was detained for more than a year.

162
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,979
A couple months ago,

163
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,979
she was finally put before a judge

164
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,350
and told what the chargers were:

165
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,490
“sending messages relating to Falun Gong

166
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,210
on WeChat.”

167
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,500
And in China’s Sichuan province,

168
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,330
a Tibetan man was arrested and jailed

169
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,550
for the heinous crime

170
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,470
of being part of a WeChat group

171
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,930
wishing the Dalai Lama a happy birthday.

172
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,930
So if you think you’re safe

173
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,660
sending private messages to your friends...

174
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,620
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

175
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,450
WeChat is like the One Ring

176
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,830
from Lord of the Rings.

177
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,440
The moment you put it on,

178
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,340
they know how to find you.

179
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,419
The almost 900 million people using WeChat

180
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,940
are having their every conversation,

181
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,150
every purchase,

182
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,390
every move monitored by a regime

183
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,780
that’s eager to detain them for “subversion.”

184
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,700
But on the other hand, WeChat sure is convenient.

185
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,740
But before you blame WeChat

186
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,389
as the root of all evil,

187
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,509
remember that even powerful genies

188
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,160
have masters.

189
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,440
In order for WeChat—

190
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,789
or really any large company—

191
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,180
to operate in China,

192
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,880
it’s required by law to share data

193
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,320
with Chinese authorities.

194
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,319
And it has to have a Communist Party Secretary

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,990
on staff to monitor its operations.

196
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
Just last week,

197
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,490
WeChat and several other Chinese mega apps

198
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,949
all found themselves under investigation.

199
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,860
“China’s Cyberspace Administration

200
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,319
accused internet users

201
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,449
of ‘spreading violence, terror,

202
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,229
false rumours, pornography

203
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,740
and other hazards to national security,

204
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
public safety,

205
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,009
and social order.’”

206
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,789
But don’t worry about poor WeChat;

207
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,400
they’ll come out of this just fine—

208
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,010
as long as they work even harder

209
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,490
to police their own content

210
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,010
and make sure it doesn’t,

211
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,010
you know,

212
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,069
disrupt China’s social harmony.

213
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,690
So essentially, the CCP uses tactics

214
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,639
like launching scary investigations

215
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,710
to force WeChat and other private Chinese
companies

216
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,990
to do the CCP’s bidding.

217
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,900
So how was something as frightening

218
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,710
and all-knowing as WeChat

219
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,710
able to come into being

220
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,009
in the first place?

221
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,710
It’s all thanks to its relationship

222
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,460
with its ultimate master,

223
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,310
the Chinese Communist Party.

224
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,699
WeChat was developed

225
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,660
by the Chinese social media giant

226
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Tencent.

227
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,960
It’s the world’s tenth most valuable

228
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,000
publicly traded company,

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,270
so it had a lot money to invest.

230
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,539
But according to Fortune,

231
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,080
Tencent, “would never have grown to that
size

232
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,569
were it not for the company’s close relationship

233
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:53,960
with China’s government.”

234
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,229
You see, when the US allowed China

235
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,150
to join the World Trade Organization in 2001,

236
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,669
it kept the status of a “developing economy.”

237
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,110
That meant China had greater access

238
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,590
to US markets while at the same time,

239
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,069
the Chinese regime got to make a lot of rules

240
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:12,870
that created an unfair advantage for Chinese
firms.

241
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,610
They began “limiting access

242
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,370
or demanding that foreign companies

243
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,919
take on a Chinese partner

244
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,860
and transfer their intellectual property to
China

245
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,379
as the price of access.”

246
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,159
In China, plagiarization

247
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,430
is an established business model.

248
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,699
We’re going to talk about that

249
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,139
more after the break.

250
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,909
But suffice it to say,

251
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,760
Tencent and its app WeChat

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,340
were able to grow so much

253
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,560
because foreign competitors were mostly kept

254
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,640
out of China,

255
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,260
and those that got in were suppressed.

256
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,870
So this let local Chinese companies

257
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,640
thrive off the foreign technology

258
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,810
they may or may not have stolen.

259
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,810
For example,

260
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,000
“Tencent’s QQ instant messaging [app]

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,300
is based on Israel’s ICQ.”

262
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,830
The Chinese Communist Party has a reason

263
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,290
for supporting companies like TenCent.

264
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,290
They call it,

265
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,900
“Made in China 2025.”

266
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,620
I’m assuming they’re using Made in China

267
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,700
as if it were a good thing.

268
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,560
The CCP wants China to become

269
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,900
“the world leader in electric vehicles,

270
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,360
new materials, artificial intelligence,

271
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,610
semiconductors, bio-pharmacy,

272
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,910
5G mobile communications

273
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,900
and other industries.”

274
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,630
So someday, the entire world

275
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,860
can be using Chinese tech like WeChat.

276
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,330
But don’t worry,

277
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,460
there’ll still be Western companies,

278
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,540
and they would never share data

279
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,140
with Chinese authorities.

280
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,940
And coming up after the break,

281
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,010
we’ll have more on all the fun things

282
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,670
that happened because of China’s entry

283
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,860
to the World Trade Organization.

284
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,100
WTO?

285
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,240
You’ll be saying WT-.

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,620
Wait!

287
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,640
Are you getting notified

288
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,770
every time we publish a new video?

289
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,770
If not,

290
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,430
make sure you’re subscribed to China Uncensored,

291
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,460
and then tap that bell icon down there

292
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,270
until it looks like this.

293
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,340
We’ll notify you

294
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,720
as soon as we upload a new video.

295
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
So click that bell now,

296
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
and I’ll see you again in a couple days.

297
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,160
I’m always watching you...
