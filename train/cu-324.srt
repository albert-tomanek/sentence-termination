1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,440
Chinese ships are swarming a reef\h

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,800
In the South China Sea

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
Are they sheltering from rough seas?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,400
Or taking more territory?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,520
Trouble is brewing in the South China Sea.\h

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,200
This is Whitsun Reef.\h

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,360
It’s about 175 miles off the coast of the\h
Philippines. It’s also in the Spratly Islands.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
If that name sounds familiar, it’s because\h
the Chinese Communist Party has been building\h\h

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
artificial islands in the\h
Spratlys for almost a decade now.\h

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
More about those islands in a moment.\h

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,320
The recent news is, a massive Chinese\h
fishing fleet has anchored at Whitsun Reef,\h\h

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
causing tension with the Philippines.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,800
In early March, the Philippine Coast Guard spotted\h
more than 200 Chinese ships at Whitsun Reef.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,240
The Coast Guard later released\h
this image of some of those ships.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,400
And the Philippine Defense Secretary\h
has asked the Chinese vessels to leave.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,520
That’s because Whitsun Reef is within\h
the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone,\h\h

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
according to international maritime law.\h

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
But to no one’s surprise, the Chinese Communist\h
Party has ignored international maritime law.\h

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,080
“China ignored the call, insisting\h
it owns the offshore territory\h\h

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
and that the vessels were\h
sheltering from rough seas.”

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,640
Territorial claims aside, sheltering from rough\h
seas sounds reasonable, right? The problem is,\h\h

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,320
that’s a lie.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,680
It’s a lie because these Chinese ships have\h
been at Whitsun Reef since December 2020.\h\h

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,440
That’s according to Simularity, a tech\h
company that analyzes satellite images.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,800
The satellite imagery shows that large numbers\h
of Chinese ships have been arriving, mooring,\h\h

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,440
and departing Whitsun Reef since mid-December.\h

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,920
In these images from last week, Simularity\h
counted approximately 200 Chinese ships,\h\h

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
including some which may be\h
Chinese Coast Guard ships.\h\h

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,240
They also said that only one ship\h
appeared to be visibly fishing.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,720
And in images from March and stretching back to\h
December, you can see these ships moored together.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,880
Which is also what’s happening in this photo\h
released by the Philippine Coast Guard.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,360
As Simularity points out, the\h
ships lashed together like this\h\h

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,600
are not fishing. They’re also\h
not waiting out rough seas,\h\h

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,840
because lashing ships together in rough\h
seas can damage them. So that’s also a lie.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,600
So what are these ships doing?  Are\h
they playing bumper boats?\h

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,000
Are they LARPing Waterworld?\h

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
Maybe they’re forming a fishing vessel MegaZord.\h

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
Or doing a historical reenactment\h
of the Battle of the Red Cliffs.

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,480
Or they’re getting together for a\h
massive TikTok sea shanty singalong.\h

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,880
But if it’s not any of those, the most likely\h
explanation is the Chinese Communist Party is\h\h

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,680
trying to occupy Whitsun Reef. Those ships will\h
stay there until everyone else just gives up\h\h

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,160
and accepts it. And then the Chinese\h
Communist Party will take over the reef,\h\h

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,120
and eventually start building\h
an artificial island on top.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,880
And that’s even more likely given that at\h
least some of those Chinese fishing vessels\h\h

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
are actually part of China’s Maritime Militia.

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
In fact, tracking shows that several\h
of these Maritime Militia ships\h\h

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
have been patrolling the area for the last year.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,880
And they’re patrolling in patterns that no\h
normal fishing vessels would ever exhibit.

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,480
When faced with accusations from the Philippines\h
that these fishing vessels are actually part of\h\h

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,040
China’s maritime militia, the Chinese embassy\h
said, “There is no Chinese Maritime Militia.”\h

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,720
Which is another lie. Boy they’re\h
good at that. More after the break.

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,000
Welcome back.

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
If all this Whitsun Reef stuff feels like deja vu,\h\h

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
it’s because a similar thing happened\h
back in 2012. At the Scarborough Shoal.

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,880
There was a two-month standoff between Chinese\h
and Philippine ships at the shoal. Until the US\h\h

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
stepped in to negotiate.
\h\h

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
“By the end of the meeting between Kurt\h
Campbell, then the top US diplomat for Asia,\h\h

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
and Fu Ying, China’s vice\h
foreign minister for Asia,\h\h

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
the US side believed they had an\h
agreement for both sides to withdraw.”

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
But the Chinese side\h
immediately broke the agreement.\h\h

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Because when the Philippines withdrew\h
their ships, the Chinese ships stayed.\h\h

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,120
And the Chinese regime has pretty much\h
controlled the Scarborough Shoal since then.

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,760
When we went to the Scarborough Shoal\h
in 2016 in a Filipino fishing boat,\h\h

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,520
we could see the Chinese coast guard\h
ships guarding the entrance to the shoal.

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,680
And although we were able to get to the shoal,\h
Chinese ships often stop Filipino boats from being\h\h

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,600
able to go there. The boat we were on had even\h
previously been rammed by the Chinese coast guard.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
So far, the Chinese Communist Party hasn’t built\h
an artificial island at the Scarborough Shoal.\h\h

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,760
They’re content to just hold onto\h
their control over the area.\h

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,000
But that’s not the case in the Spratly\h
Islands, where Whitsun Reef is located.\h\h

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,840
The Chinese regime has already built\h
7 artificial islands in the Spratlys.\h

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,200
Since 2013, China has added 3,200\h
acres of new land in the Spratlys.\h

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,520
One of these new islands, on Hughes Reef,\h
is only 10 nautical miles from Whitsun Reef.

74
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Three of China’s most advanced artificial islands\h\h

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,720
are in the Spratlys as well: Subi Reef,\h
Mischief Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef.\h

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,000
In 2018, China quietly installed\h
missile systems on those islands.

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,280
So if the Chinese regime takes over Whitsun\h
Reef, which was previously unoccupied,\h\h

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
it’s much more likely they’ll\h
build an island there, too.\h\h

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Especially because many of the areas near\h
Whitsun Reef are claimed by other countries.\h

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
The closest occupied reefs\h
are claimed by Vietnam.\h

81
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,440
Which means Vietnam is not happy\h
about the situation, either.

82
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
So this could become an even bigger standoff than\h
the Scarborough Shoal incident back in 2012.\h

83
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,240
The Philippines is now sending fighter aircraft\h
over the Chinese vessels to monitor the situation.

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,440
And the Philippines defense secretary says the\h
“military will also beef up its naval presence\h\h

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,720
in the South China Sea to conduct ‘sovereignty\h
patrols’ and protect Filipino fishermen.”

86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,520
Meanwhile, the US has said it backs\h
the Philippines in this standoff.

87
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,120
The US Embassy in Manila also accused China\h
of using “maritime militia to intimidate,\h\h

88
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,320
provoke, and threaten other nations, which\h
undermines peace and security in the region.”

89
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,160
You know, the Maritime Militia that the\h
Chinese regime says doesn’t even exist.\h

90
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,040
But here’s the danger for the Biden\h
administration. President Biden’s Asia czar is\h\h

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Kurt Campbell. Campbell is the guy who negotiated\h
the failed Scarborough Shoal deal in 2012.

92
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,680
The Obama administration’s mistake still has\h
repercussions today. “The fact that China got\h\h

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,840
away with reneging on the 2012 Scarborough Shoal\h
deal continues to undermine U.S. credibility.”\h

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
US allies like the Philippines believed\h
they had to adopt a friendlier policy\h\h

95
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
to the Chinese Communist Party because\h
the US wouldn’t be able to help them.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party adopted\h
the “Scarborough model.” It still uses those\h\h

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,200
same tactics to take over territory elsewhere, bit\h
by bit. They do it all over the South China Sea.\h\h

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,120
And on the Indian border. And the Party\h
is not going to stop, because it works.

99
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,400
So what happens now at Whitsun Reef?\h

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
The best case scenario is:\h
international pressure mounts\h\h

101
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,320
until the Chinese ships are forced to leave.

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,920
But so far, the Chinese Communist Party\h
is just denying everything and showing no\h\h

103
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,280
sign of backing down. Which means the\h
US will likely have to get involved.\h

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,640
The US has said it backs the Philippines.

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,840
But would the Biden administration make the\h
same mistake as the Obama administration?\h\h

106
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,040
Will they believe the Chinese\h
Communist Party’s lies?\h

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,800
If they do make that mistake, that\h
would be a huge blow to the US\h\h

108
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,880
and its ability to keep the peace in\h
the region. And it would be a huge\h\h

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,560
win for the Chinese Communist Party and its\h
ultimate goal to control the South China Sea.

110
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
So let’s hope the US has\h
learned its lesson from 2012.\h

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
fans who support the show on the\h
crowdfunding website Patreon.

113
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,560
Ian Jackson asks, “Ahh Chris.\h You're like a\h
Taiwanese pineapple.\h Rough on the outside,\h\h

114
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,400
sweet on the inside and the\h
CCP is trying to ban you. \h So,\h\h

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,640
What's the story with the CCP?\h When\h
will they learn that trying to ban\h\h

116
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,320
something just makes everybody look at it in\h
greater detail? \h Didn't they get the memo?”

117
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Well Ian, I never really thought about it before,\h
but I guess I am like a Taiwanese Pineapple.\h\h

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
If you didn’t see our episode about it,\h\h

119
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,560
China recently banned the\h
import of Taiwanese pineapple.\h

120
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,800
But that created a huge backlash. In four days,\h\h

121
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,280
the people of Taiwan bought the\h
entire year's worth of exports.

122
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,240
And then globally, people began\h
buying up Taiwanese pineapples.

123
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,600
So I guess that’s one bright side to the Chinese\h
Communist Party’s aggressive behavior. It often\h\h

124
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,600
backfires, blowing up in its face and exposing the\h
true nature of the Party to the world’s people.

125
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,920
Let’s hope the same thing\h
happens with Whitsun Reef.\h

126
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,040
Thanks for your question Ian.
