1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,029
Chinese jets get aggressive against South
Korea.

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,490
There’s evidence China is killing innocent
people

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,490
for their organs.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,720
And a top exec overseeing Google is in the
hot seat.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,200
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,980
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,269
South Korea is having problems with China,

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,890
problems of the military variety.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,490
Chinese military aircraft have been repeatedly
entering

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,439
South Korea’s Air Defense Zone.

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,710
Now that’s not quite the same as Korean
territorial airspace.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,170
Airspace is covered under the United Nations
Convention

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,070
on the Law of the Sea.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,539
Even though this is the air.

15
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,999
It’s defined as 12 nautical miles from a
country’s shoreline.

16
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,629
The Air Defense Zone is bigger

17
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,629
and not defined by treaties.

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,430
But still, it’s common practice to notify
a country

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,560
if you’re going to fly your planes into
their zone.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,070
But the Chinese military didn’t.

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,800
In fact, it’s been getting more and more
aggressive.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,359
“According to the South Korean Air Force,

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,199
the number of Chinese military aircraft

24
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,000
entering its identification zone is rising.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,970
In 2016, there were about 60 incursions,

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,670
70 in 2017

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,660
and 110 were reported up to September this
year.”

28
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,500
It’s likely the Chinese Communist Party

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,110
is concerned about a US, South Korea, Japan
alliance,

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,410
a sort of Asian NATO, as some have called
it.

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,780
In 2016, South Korea and Japan

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,200
agreed to an intelligence sharing treaty.

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,260
China’s military criticized it as part of
a cold war mentality.

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,280
Of course, flying your jets through

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,840
another country’s air defense zone

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,090
in no way could be considered a cold war mentality.

37
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,720
Not at all.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,900
China is on trial!

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,450
For some serious crimes against humanity.

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,100
Over the weekend in London,

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,070
an independent people’s tribunal was held
to examine

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,790
evidence that the Chinese Communist Party

43
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,410
is killing people for their organs.

44
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,610
People’s tribunals are typically set up

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,040
by victims of a serious crime,

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
when governments are unwilling to investigate
an issue.

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
After all, what government would want to

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,030
offend the Chinese Communist Party?

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,060
Do you know how much business we can do in
China?!

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,760
“The charges are that many groups including
Falun Gong practitioners,

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,470
Uighurs, some Christians, and some Buddhists,

52
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,670
have been taken as prisoners, checked on a
regular basis

53
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,190
whether they are medically fit, and then,

54
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,660
when the time comes, their organs are removed.

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,140
Some stories say without any anesthetics,

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,750
in a very horrible way—

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,890
and immediately transplanted into an organ
visitor.”

58
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,640
Many of the witness who testified were labor
camp survivors.

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,310
They had stories of extreme torture or sexual
assault—

60
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,350
but also strange medical tests.

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,610
Tests very similar to what would be needed
to match an organ.

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,890
According to Freedom House,

63
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,390
“The organ transplant industry in China
remains

64
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,600
enormous and growing,

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,960
even as the number of judicially executed
prisoners

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,120
has declined over the past decade.”

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,860
So where are they getting the organs?

68
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,510
The Tribunal’s chair,

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,730
former English Judge Geoffrey Nice QC,

70
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,260
said the tribunal unanimously found beyond

71
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,040
reasonable doubt that China has been committing

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,900
forced organ harvesting from prisoners of
conscience.

73
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,760
There will be more hearings early next year,

74
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,410
followed by a report.

75
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,420
And with any luck,

76
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,220
the issue might start actually getting

77
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,240
some attention from the mainstream media.

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,850
Of course, I think what they really need as
a publicity stunt.

79
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,350
How about a re-release of The Oregon Trail—

80
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,930
but set in China?

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,420
The CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet,

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,880
was asked to testify before the US House Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday.

83
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,640
There were a lot of issues on the table,

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,390
but a key one was how Google has been accused
of

85
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,030
secretly working on a censored search app
for the Chinese market.

86
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,520
Internally, Google gave it the codename Project
Dragonfly.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,020
But the CEO stuck pretty closely to the talking
points

88
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,650
Google has been using since these accusations

89
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,990
came to light this summer.

90
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,690
"Right now, we have no plans to launch in
China.

91
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,210
We don't have a search product there.

92
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,930
Our core mission is to provide users access
to information,

93
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,880
and getting access to information is an important
human right.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,420
So we are always compelled across the world

95
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,850
to try hard to provide that information."

96
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,739
Basically, he’s saying Google hasn’t launched

97
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,840
any search engine in China.

98
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,820
But he didn’t specifically say Google

99
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,920
won’t launch one in the future.

100
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,870
And really, what’s the point of giving your
project

101
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,910
a cool codename if you’re not planning to
launch it?

102
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,620
Now Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,220
and the Committee to Protect Journalists

104
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,340
all signed a letter urging Google not to go
into China.

105
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,310
But they weren’t the only ones.

106
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,310
Another signator,

107
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,380
coming all the way from Russia,

108
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,790
was Edward Snowden.

109
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,590
Have you ever stayed at a Marriott hotel?

110
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, you might be one of the 500 million
people

111
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,419
whose personal information was taken by mysterious
hackers

112
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,460
back in September.

113
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,470
And I know this may surprise you,

114
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,660
but guess which country these mysterious hackers
were from?

115
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,199
It’s China.

116
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,470
The revelations come as,

117
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,620
“The Trump administration is planning actions

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,420
targeting China’s trade, cyber and economic
policies,

119
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,070
perhaps within days...

120
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,919
[and] also plans to declassify intelligence
reports to reveal

121
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,410
Chinese efforts dating to at least 2014

122
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,090
to build a database containing names of executives

123
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,490
and American government officials with security
clearances.”

124
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,669
We’ll keep you updated on those moves by
the Trump administration.

125
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,930
Remember a couple weeks ago how I told you
about

126
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,370
the Chinese scientist who claimed to have
created

127
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,889
genetically engineered twin babies?

128
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,290
Well, he’s missing.

129
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,699
Have authorities detained him because

130
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,610
his Frankenstein experiment made Chinese science
look bad?

131
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,630
Or did they just kidnap him for a secret project

132
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,310
to genetically engineer super soldiers?

133
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,600
I guess we’ll find out in World War III.

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
Speaking of abductions,

135
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,640
100 Christians have been abducted by Chinese
authorities,

136
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,860
some in the middle of the night.

137
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,690
They were all members of an underground Protestant
church.

138
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,390
Underground churches are ones that aren’t
approved

139
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,790
by the Chinese Communist Party and don’t
have state-approved pastors.

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,650
This is part of an escalating persecution
of Christians in China.

141
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,090
According to Bob Fu,

142
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,430
founder of the US-based Christian rights organization
China Aid, “

143
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,180
There were more than 10,000 cases of detention
of Christians this year,

144
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,889
compared with just over 3,000 cases for the
whole of last year.”

145
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,130
And it’s not just Christian worshippers
that have been targeted in China.

146
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,070
Authorities in Shandong Province noticed people
in one small village

147
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,180
had begun worshiping a giant stalk of sorghum.

148
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,480
They believed that since it had grown unnaturally
large,

149
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,770
it was most likely endowed with supernatural
qualities.

150
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,600
Obviously, any kind of non-atheist belief
like this

151
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,530
is a serious threat to China’s social harmony.

152
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,960
So police came and chopped it down.

153
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,130
Chinese police also announced a new policy

154
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,100
where all local imaginary friends will be
rounded up for execution.

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
So what do you think?

156
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Leave your comments below.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
And before you go,

158
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,350
it’s the time you’ve all been waiting
for,

159
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,930
when I answer questions from a member of my
50 cent army,

160
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,210
fans who support China Uncensored

161
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,140
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,480
San Son asks,

163
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,630
“I plan to leave Patreon.

164
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,040
Do you have an alternative support processor?”

165
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,760
Ah, I’ve been hearing this from several
people recently.

166
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,389
Some of you are concerned about Patreon as
a platform

167
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,190
after they banned a few YouTubers.

168
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,949
I understand where you’re coming from.

169
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,030
I would like to say that by abandoning Patreon,

170
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,690
it definitely hurts China Uncensored

171
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,800
more than it hurts Patreon.

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
And it also hurts you,

173
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,820
because Patreon gives us a platform

174
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,130
to easily provide all the perks to our supporters.

175
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,259
But even though we still prefer to use Patreon,

176
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,009
there are other ways you can contribute to
China Uncensored

177
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,150
if you want.

178
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,020
If you go to chinauncensored.tv/support,

179
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,360
you’ll see other options,

180
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,039
including direct PayPal contributions.

181
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,259
I’ve also heard from some of you I should
look into

182
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,770
Patreon alternatives like Subscribestar.

183
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,300
I’ll take a look at that platform and any
others you recommend.

184
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Either way,

185
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,720
I would like to thank you for the support
you’ve given

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,100
and hope you’ll find ways to continue,

187
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,460
even if it’s not on Patreon.

188
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,229
But for all of you still on Patreon, remember,

189
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,120
you get to submit questions to me that I’ll
answer on the show!

190
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,539
So leave your questions for me there.

191
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,590
And to everybody,

192
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,900
thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

193
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,449
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

194
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,460
see you next time.
