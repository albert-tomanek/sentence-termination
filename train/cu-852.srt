1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,200
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,620
can the Chinese Communist Party just buy South
Korea?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,100
Morally, I mean.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,680
Also with millions of dollars.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,519
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,509
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:19,250
I was in South Korea a couple months ago.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,790
And one thing that struck me is how much influence
there is there from China.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,940
Chinese tourists.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,380
Chinese restaurants.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,050
Even knock-off Chinese toys.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,179
Now by and large,

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,999
South Koreans I spoke with were very welcoming
to Chinese people.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,700
“We have a long history between the Chinese
and Koreans.”

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,700
But you know whose influence most South Koreans
don’t really like?

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,090
The Chinese Communist Party.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,060
I mean, the only reason communist North Korea
is still around

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,150
to threaten the South is because they were
backed by the Chinese Communist Party.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,070
But China likes to play both sides.

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,660
That’s why China is now South Korea’s
biggest trading partner.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,260
But people there are still wary of the Communist
Party’s influence.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,680
And they should be!

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,190
Because there’s new evidence that South
Korea’s national state-run TV broadcaster

24
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,180
has sold out to China.

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,370
I’m talking about KBS.

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,020
And the theater they own, KBS Hall.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,870
Back in December,

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,200
KBS Hall signed a contract for this show,
Shen Yun, to perform there.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,650
But then, in January,

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,430
KBS suddenly canceled the contract,

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,920
and fired the person who signed it.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,000
But I told you in March,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
“I don't want to make wild accusations about
what's behind KBS Hall's cancellation of Shen Yun."

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,260
Well now I do want to make wild accusations.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,060
And by wild accusations,

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,950
I mean show you the hard evidence that the
Chinese Embassy was behind it,

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,880
and forced KBS to break their contract.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,150
And it involves millions of dollars.

39
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,159
But first, some background.

40
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,659
Shen Yun Performing Arts is a Chinese-American nonprofit

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,580
that does an annual classical Chinese dance show.

42
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,490
It tours around the world.

43
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,430
And while you might think that spreading Chinese
music and dance

44
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,930
would be just want Chinese leaders would want

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
You’re right. They do.

46
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,730
But only if they can completely control the
message.

47
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,599
And with Shen Yun, well…

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,930
the Communist Party can’t control it because,
guess what?

49
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,290
It was founded by Falun Gong practitioners,

50
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,409
and a couple of its dance numbers depict contemporary
issues,

51
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,430
like Falun Gong meditators standing up to the
Communist Party’s suppression.

52
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,459
Let's just say the Communist Party is not
a fan.

53
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,489
So they try to kill it.

54
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,389
Like sending a Chinese agent to slash a Shen
Yun tour bus’s tire

55
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,349
so it would explode while driving down the
highway with 50 dancers inside.

56
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,439
Which fortunately didn’t happen, but still.

57
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,730
The Communist Party also tried to stop theaters
around the world from showing Shen Yun.

58
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,470
Because apparently the greatest threat to
China's stability

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,840
is freedom of expression in other countries.

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,480
Most theaters, of course, have stood up to
the Communist Party

61
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,529
which is why you can watch Shen Yun in more
than a hundred cities every year.

62
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,209
Which brings us back to South Korea.

63
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,359
So as I told you,

64
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,059
KBS Hall in Seoul cancelled Shen Yun in January.

65
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,760
That was a breach of contract.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,349
So Shen Yun’s promotion company sued KBS.

67
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,779
After my episode in March, the South Korean
court ruled in favor of Shen Yun.

68
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:24,900
In this document,

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,209
the court wrote that KBS had no legitimate
reason to break the contract,

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,959
and that the show must go on!

71
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,900
So organizers got to work,

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,439
selling thousands of tickets for the shows,

73
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,989
scheduled for May 6 through 8.

74
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,889
But then, on May 4, the court suddenly reversed
its decision,

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,340
canceling Shen Yun once again.

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,269
And it came just ahead of a long national
holiday weekend,

77
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,790
so there was no way to appeal.

78
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,790
And the show did not go on.

79
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,029
You see, it turned out KBS Hall had lied in
court.

80
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,430
During the initial lawsuit, they told judges
a

81
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,819
“Shen Yun performance is unsuitable for
KBS Hall,”

82
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,439
but “denied China’s influence on its decision.”

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,829
instead, saying it would damage KBS’s public
image.

84
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,219
Well you know what really damages KBS’s
public image?

85
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,469
Perjury.

86
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,259
Because in order to get the court to rule
in its favor,

87
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,709
KBS eventually ’fessed up, and showed the
court not one

88
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,530
but two letters from the Chinese Embassy in
Seoul

89
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,150
directly proving “China’s influence on
its decision.”

90
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,199
This one dated January 22 contains some thinly
veiled threats, including:

91
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,190
“KBS is Korea’s largest television station

92
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,879
and its influence on Korea is significant;

93
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,509
it also has friendly ties with China Central
Television.”

94
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,009
And

95
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:50,060
“[China] hopes that KBS will consider China–Korea
relations when making decisions.

96
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,580
Do not provide a venue for Shen Yun to perform.”

97
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,930
It’s kind of like what the mafia does.

98
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,500
“I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t
refuse.”

99
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,920
But KBS covered it up at first.

100
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,800
It only revealed the Embassy’s threats when
it felt it had no choice.

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,900
Now you might think the South Korean court
would have said,

102
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,270
“A foreign government doesn’t get to threaten
our country.

103
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,610
And hey KBS, you just lied in court.”

104
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,840
But instead it said,

105
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,770
“Oh you’ve been bought out by China?

106
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,449
Well then yes, absolutely!

107
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,479
You can go ahead and break your contract.”

108
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,710
You see, in the final ruling,

109
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,629
the South Korean court judge wrote that if
KBS Hall were to allow Shen Yun to perform,

110
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,810
KBS, quote, “may face a huge loss which
can’t be compared

111
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,210
with the income from ticket selling.”

112
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,139
And here it says that,

113
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,750
as a major TV broadcaster,

114
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,479
KBS’s broadcasts to China are worth more
than the equivalent of 8 million US Dollars

115
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,259
per year.

116
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,180
Because while it may be illegal to break a
contract under normal circumstances,

117
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,129
it’s ok if you’ll make lots of money from
breaking it.

118
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,469
So after decades fighting against one brutal
communist regime,

119
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:07,580
the South Korean government simply sold out
to another for a few million bucks.

120
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,770
So what do you think? And what would you like
to say to KBS?

121
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,069
Leave your comments below.

122
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,000
Once again I’m Chris Chappell. See you next
time.
