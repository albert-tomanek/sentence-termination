00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,670
on this episode of china uncensored
duck, duck

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,549
there's a lot of dead ducks here

3
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:12,559
i wouldn't johnson's it on your house
chris chapel china continues to inspire

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,530
people towards vegetarianism with the
caramel of dead animals

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,340
it keeps washing up in people's water
supplies

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,000
by recently reported that six thousand
decades washed up in a major shanghai

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,930
river

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,830
authorities think they were dumped by
pig farms upstream after the pigs died

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,440
of disease which is of course ridiculous
how could a couple of pig farms dumped

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,470
six thousand dead pigs

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,340
obviously that number should be much
higher

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,600
seven thousand

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,800
yon

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,320
eight thousand kamon china has next to
no regulations at least on businesses

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,820
ten thousand are you can fight so there
are a lot of dead pigs

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,090
fourteen thousand would be too little

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,960
how about sixteen thousand disease dead
pigs in their drinking water

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,510
do you know how many mika read you could
make with them

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,430
technically none the grades aren't
actually made out of pork but you get

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,590
the idea

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,640
and it's not just shanghai where people
had turned the rivers into graveyards in

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,470
hunan studio city they found another one
hundred dead pigs then right around the

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,549
corner and trying to stop italy found
fifty more

24
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,780
and it wasn't just pains

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,220
one local authorities said they were
dead chickens and ducks to

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,760
and it wasn't just in hunan province

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,830
sichuan province had half thousand dead
docs

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,560
thousand dead docs

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,570
don't worry though officials are saying
even though they don't know where all

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,730
the dead animals are coming from or why
they're dying like it's going out of

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,710
business

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,130
the water safe to drink and there's no
risk to humans

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,700
you know this is looking more and more
like a biblical plague tumi so let's see

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,539
we've got blood frogs hale this is
passed on ps

35
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,000
locust darkness

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,509
