7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,880
Hello you... lot!

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,800
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,680
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,980
And there's a special prize for
particularly good answers, which is...

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,860
[Audience sings]

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,700
ALL: Oh yeah.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,640
GARY: What have we done?

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
And today, we are talking about
the Ice Block Expedition of 1959.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,620
Is this like King Cnut holding back the tide?

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,860
Trying to stop it melting by sheer force of will?

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
MATT: Who's Will?

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,200
Well, this is the problem with the expedition.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,920
They couldn't find enough people called
Bill, Will and William or Willis to take along,

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,240
which is why it's failed,
which is why the ice caps are still melting.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,020
MATT: Oh.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Well, that's called, they all have bread-making
hands and they're all too warm.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
You need them to be pastry hands to do that,
they're all cold, don't you.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,640
TOM: What?!

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,680
Oh, for the love of f***! Look...

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,920
If you've got 'bread-making hands',
you've got warm hands,

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
because you need warm hands to activate the yeast.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,220
If you've got cold hands, you've got
'pastry-making hands',

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,640
because that keeps the pastry cold
and the butter doesn't melt...

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,940
...dickhead.

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,380
[Laughter]

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,740
So if you've got bread-making hands,
you can melt dickheads?

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,580
GARY: Yes.

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,440
CHRIS: Is it like a superpower?
GARY: Go!

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,760
Yaargh!

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,260
Somebody'd pay for that, you know that, don't you?

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
This was a publicity stunt.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,220
In fact, it was called the biggest
publicity stunt the world had ever seen.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,920
MATT: Was this a beverage company trying to serve
their drinks with 'Arctic Ice!' or something like that?

43
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,800
TOM: I'm going to give you a point for 'arctic ice'...
[DING]

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
TOM: Because it was starting from —

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,960
This is a 'no', isn't it. But I'm getting a point somehow.

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,000
That's like a teacher at school...

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,860
'Yes...? Has anyone else got any suggestions?'

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,020
You're right about arctic ice.
But it was not a beverage company.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,400
Was it one of these mad things, where they were
going to, like, irrigate the Kalahari or something?

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,640
[DING]

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,900
Get in!

52
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,280
It wasn't irrigation,

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,180
but it was an attempt to get an ice block
from the Arctic Circle to the equator.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,540
MATT: For the lolz.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,300
For the publicity.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
Just get a cool box!

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,820
CHRIS: How big's your cool box?
I mean, I know you eat a lot of pies, but...

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,040
So what kind of company would
want to do a publicity stunt

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,240
by moving ice all that distance over land to the equator?

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,380
CHRIS: Over land?!

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,320
TOM: Over land.
MATT: Over land?

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
GARY: A fridge company.

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,080
CHRIS: Haulage company.
GARY: To show the beneficiary of...

64
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,460
Or asbestos company, to show
how good the asbestos is.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,280
[DING] It's not asbestos, but it's insulation.

66
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,940
You keep giving us points and
saying it's not what we said!

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,400
It's a Norwegian insulation company.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,220
I'm going to give you a point, because if there
wasn't asbestos in that, I'll be very surprised.

69
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,040
And frankly, if there is asbestos in it,
*they* will have been very surprised.

70
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,900
[Laughter]

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Not until about 25 years later, I'll guess.

72
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,420
It was made from glass wool. Made from fibreglass.

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
GARY: Glass wool.

74
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,180
This was inspired by a radio station.

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,040
In 1958, which radio station would
have put up a challenge like that?

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,380
[Posh voice]  The BBC World Service.

77
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,680
TOM: Very much the opposite.

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,600
The ITV World Service.

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,500
[Applause]

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,260
Brought up in the '80s!

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,480
What would the ITV World Service be?

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,780
Because that's basically just Keith Lemon.

83
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,160
It's Ant & Dec.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,140
To be fair, that sounds like something ITV
and Ant & Dec would do now, wouldn't they.

85
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,180
'We're gonna transport a block of ice to the equator, live!'

86
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,640
Stripped over two weeks' worth and
you'd vote off which bit of ice you don't like.

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,980
Any ITV commissioners: 25 percent, yeah?

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,480
Now, you say it's a radio station...

89
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,040
[Pirate voice]
May it have been, yarrr, one that be on a boat?

90
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,440
Well, it was certainly beyond our borders.

91
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,540
It was Radio Luxembourg.

ALL: Ohh.

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,900

of ice from the Arctic Circle to the equator.

94
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,480

going to award for this?

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
[Radio voice]  A car!

103
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,100
Someone who works in radio.

104
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,600
A s***load of tonic.

105
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,500
[Laughter]

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,120
I mean, you could buy that with this...

GARY: 'Free drinks all round!'

108
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,620

110
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,900
One million dollars.

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,460
Oh.

112
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,960
[DING]

113

GARY: You're doing it again!
[Laughter]

115
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,140
No, no, I'm getting there...

116
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,740
'No.' Ding!
What is this?!

117
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,900
...per kilo that made it to the Arctic.

118
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,040
CHRIS: Whoa.
GARY: Ahhh.

119
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,900
So theoretically, that was anything up to...

120
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,240
three hundred million francs,
if I've done my maths right...

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,760
But if someone actually managed
to get the three tons of ice there,

122
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,780
and suddenly, oh, an insulation
company's got involved...

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,620
They started being very worried.

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,860
How did they get the ice out of the Arctic?
Did it take a digger or something?

125
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,860
MATT: You know when you've got an ice lolly,
and you lick one bit and it goes in?

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,500
MATT: They're just licking it into squares.

127
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760

Your mam's in!

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,620
They actually got it out from a glacier in 200-kilo blocks.

135
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,820
What do you use to remove that much ice?

[Applause]

141
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,380
I knew you'd get that, because you
have a chainsaw license, don't you?

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Not since October.

143
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,680
ALL: Awww.

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,580
And you're all slightly safer in your beds.

[Laughter]

146
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,840
But when we had that absinthe and chainsaw night
last week, you told me you were fully qualified!

147
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
CHRIS: Once you're drunk, you don't need to be qualified.

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,260
It all becomes much more natural.

149
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,360
To be fair, I don't think Leatherface from the
horror movies really had a license for that.

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,960
It's not a requirement.

151
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,540
You see what happened?
You see what happened?!

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,940
That's fair. That's fair.

153
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Is that like Al Capone? Is that what they got him on?

154
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,180
So yes. 200-kilo blocks,

155
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,620
melted together to make a single
block of ice weighing 3,050 kilos.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,480
Now, I'm setting this up specifically for Gary:

157
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,740
What was the container they
constructed for it made from?

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
GARY: IRON.
TOM: Correct! [DING]

159
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,740
There's two little squirrels in my head...

160
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,180
One was saying, 'Say iron!'
The other was saying, 'Say anything else!'

161
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,080
'Wool!'

162
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,660
They placed it on top of a truck that would carry it
all the way to the equator, accompanied by what?

163
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,340
Two of every animal!

164
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,340
Gin! In a big tanker behind it.

165
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,320
That's fair...
A film crew, sadly.

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,260
Where did they go? They started —

167
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,300
CHRIS: South.
MATT: The equator.

168
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,260
Well, yes, okay.

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,320
GARY: Point! Point!

170
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,540
I'm not giving you a point for that.

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
They started near —
well, they started in the Arctic Circle...

172
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,900
MATT: Where? Norway Arctic?

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,880
Norway, yes.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh. Cheating bastards!

175
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,460
How is that cheating?

176
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,180
I don't know. I had this thing that they'd gone
all the way to the North Pole and done it...

177
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,840
No, Arctic Circle to equator.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,940
Oh, of course, right. In my head I had an image of
an iron tank with the North Pole sticking out at the top.

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
CHRIS: I was going to say.

180
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,040
You can just get a budget flight to the Arctic.

181
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,820
Yeah!

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,180
Yeah, but can you imagine the
carry-on fees for three tons of ice?

183
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Slice it. One in each seat.

184
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,500
Just have refrigerated pockets on
a fishing vest and take it bit by bit.

185
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,380
TOM: That's how you get past Ryanair charges, isn't it.

186
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,260
Yeah, yeah. You just wear all the ice.

187
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,520
So the first stop was Oslo,
which seems a sensible place.

188
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,700
What would be needed near the equator,
at Libreville, where they finished?

189
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Food.

190
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,060
Not quite. Certainly something that was
needed for people who lived there.

191
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
GARY: Fish.
CHRIS: Jam.

192
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,800
MATT: Vaccines and medicines.

193
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,660
TOM: Matt gets the point. Absolutely right. [DING]

194
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,980
300 kilos of medicines.

195
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,440
Obviously, they can keep them cold. They've got ice.

196
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,700
Oh God! I didn't think of using
the ice to transport something.

197
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,620
I just thought you meant something else
that was along for the ride.

198
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,440
No, medicines go off in the heat,
so suddenly, they had a lot of ice...

199
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,680
Within it, was there a horror from beyond time
that had yet to be unfrozen as well?

200
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,060
Half a flying saucer.

201
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,400
Not even stopped, just carried on cutting with
the chainsaw. 'Ah, ****, there's another one...'

202
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,860
I hate to set the joke up, but your mum's in.

203
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
GARY: Heyyy!

204
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Okay, right, no...

205
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
Oh, she is in! All right then.

206
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,320
What happened in Belgium?

207
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,300
The customs!

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,200
Yep. Absolutely right. [DING]
What did they not have?

209
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,040
Ice.

210
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
CHRIS: Right.
[Laughter]

211
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,980
A license to carry ice.

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,180
TOM: Yep. Absolutely right. [DING]
GARY: What?!

213
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
They didn't have a customs declaration for it.

214
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,860
[Applause]

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,740
Concealed carry for an ice cube.

216
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,200
[Old-fashioned bobby voice]
'Sorry, sir, I can see you are dripping, there...'

217
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,160
Yeah. Absolutely right. There was no
customs declaration for the ice.

218
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,140
What? The... the...

219
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,160
You can see it!

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,160
It's tons of ice!

221
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,380
TOM: How do you solve something like that?

222
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,700
MATT: Melt it!

223
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,040
GARY: Disguise it as a circus.

224
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,140
No, just a moustache and a stick-on nose.

225
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,400
'And this is Steve.'

226
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,140
[Ice creaking noise]

227
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
'Hurry up, Steve!'

228
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,220
GARY: 'He don't say much.'

229
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,540
No, a customs official just accompanied them
all the way, so officially it never entered Belgium.

230
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,100
To make sure they didn't import illegal ice.

231
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,820
Yes.

232
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,920
Wait, wait, wait.

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,920
What if a Belgian ran up and had a lick?

234
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,080
[Laughter]
What is it with me and licking?!

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,340
You should see me in the freezer.

236
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,420
You *shouldn't* see me in the freezer.
[Laughter]

237
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,520
That's why you're banned from Iceland, isn't it.

238
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,020
Both the country and the supermarket.

239
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,760
Can you imagine the recursive nature
if they had a branch of Iceland in Iceland?

240
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,100
TOM: Well, they'd just call it England, and it's just...

241
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,500
The freezers don't work, and everything's
twice as expensive as it was a month ago.

242
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,740
GARY: Heyyy! Satire.

243
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
They got to Paris...

244
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
The crew were invited to dine with...?

245
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,680
[French accent] The president.

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,760
TOM: Er, the mayor. I'll give you a point, it's close enough.
[DING]

247
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
No, it's f***ing not!

248
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,340
[Laughter]

249
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,600
Gary...

250
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,000
On the scale of civic dignitaries...

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
TOM: Do you want the point?

252
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,700
I don't want bulls*** points.

253
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,300
Down at the bottom you have mayor. Up here you have
le Président. I was talking the cheese, by the way.

254
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
Having dinner with, not of.

255
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

256
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,960
The mayor! The president!

257
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,760
God's sake! Never get *you*
into international diplomacy.

258
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,120
TOM: I think none of us should ever be
in international diplomacy, Gary.

259
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,840
Fair cop. Yeah.

260
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,160
Yes. From Paris they continued to Marseilles, and
it was lifted aboard a freighter that sailed to Algiers.

261
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,600
How much water had melted
by the point they got to the Sahara?

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,660
Er...

263
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,620
CHRIS: None. Ice melts into water.

264
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,540
[Applause]

265
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,260
[DING]

266
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,900
Go for the Biscuit one over there.

267
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,220
You're not having Biscuits for that!

268
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,780
How much ice had melted by
the time they got it to the Sahara?

269
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,780
Twenty percent.

270
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,840
An Nth.

271
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,440
Ah, that's a good fraction. You can't lose there.

272
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,600
Can't be wrong now.

273
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
Er... well, Gary wins, so...

274
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,700
Well, thing is, no, you were actually closer.
It was only four litres.

275
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,980
Out of all of that, less than one thousandth...

276
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,560
I didn't actually say anything. Did nobody notice that?

277
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,460
You said zero, so you're closer.

278
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah, but I said an Nth! That's undefinable.

279
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,020
Have we got any mathematicians in?

280
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,380
Of course we've got some mathematicians in.
Who gets the point?

281
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,280
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Chris.

282
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,780
Chris gets the point!

283
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,080
Bastard.

284
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,380
[Applause]

285
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,340
What were the instructions they got
as they went across the Sahara?

286
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,580
'Go west.'

287
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,120
[Laughter]

288
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,880
[Sings]  Life is peaceful there...

289
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,660
Matt, I know you're not good at directions...

290
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,040
If he was doing directions, he'd have said, 'Go right.'

291
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
CHRIS: Or left.

292
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,620
What was the main danger in the Sahara at that point?

293
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,680
Being shot.

294
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,540
Yet again, Chris... [DING] Absolutely right.

295
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,860
GARY: Was there a war on?

296
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,660
There was. There were 'forces hiding in the mountains'.

297
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,920
MATT: Did we start it?

298
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,180
TOM: Huh?
MATT: Did we start it?

299
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,920
CHRIS: We weren't even alive, Matt.
I don't think any of us could have started it.

300
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,860
The advice was, 'No stops, drive for your lives,
even if you get a flat tire.'

301
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,900
Cool!

302
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,000
You see, they don't have that in the driving test, do they?

303
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,640
Maybe if you go to Saharan Africa they do.

304
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,740
To be fair, there was a wonderful question —
because I did my theory test last year,

305
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,320
and one of the questions is,

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,600
'What do you do if you are driving through a tunnel,

307
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,660
but your car is on fire...'

308
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,980
[Laughter]

309
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,320
'...but your car is still drivable?'

310
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,780
MATT: Get the f*** out of the tunnel.

311
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,660
TOM: Yes! You're absolutely right.

312
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,680
If your car is drivable, get out, because
otherwise you're going to kill other people.

313
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm going to be dead honest, and I don't
want that to happen to anybody ever...

314
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,160
but s***, that'd look good.

315
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,960
Just gunning out of a tunnel in flames,
with you going, 'Ha ha! I'm doing good!'

316
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah, but it's when you're listening to Matt Monro
and there's a bulldozer at the far end anyway.

317
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,740
MATT: You're going to have to...

318
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,220
Wow. Five people here have seen The Italian Job. Okay.

319
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,620
So you've driven your burning car out of the tunnel.

320
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,280
Then you've got to somehow get out of it
with the most panache you can.

321
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,160
I wouldn't be worried about panache at that point.

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,200
As we all know, the driving test is rated on
style, control, damage and aggression, so...

323
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,480
[Laughter and applause]

324
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,100
Okay, so just for the reference:
Italian Job — no. Robot Wars — yes.

325
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,140
That's fine.

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
GARY: We've found their level.

327
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,960
MATT: Can I ask a question?
TOM: Yes.

328
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,940
What were we talking about?

329
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,240
[Laughter]

330
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,060
Because I can't remember.

331
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,600
TOM: They were crossing the Sahara
on the Ice Block Expedition of 1959.

332
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
They had taken a block of ice from the Arctic Circle,

333
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,440
They'd made it to the Sahara.
They met a tribe that lived there...

334
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,000
TOM: And how did they greet them?
What did they give them for, er...

335
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
MATT: Hugs.
GARY: Water pistol fight.

336
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,240
Bit one-sided, but you know...

337
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,040
TOM: You're close...

338
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,840
Water.

339
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes. Absolutely right. [DING]
They gave the camels water from the container.

340
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,660
Um, the commentary...

341
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,900
Did a camel get his tongue stuck to the big
block of ice while they were doing it?

342
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,000
I believe they had a small spigot
on the bottom that could drain the —

343
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,880
Oh, good use of the word 'spigot', Tom.

344
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,500
What would be in the water, given what it's insulated in?

345
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh, fibreglass...

346
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,240
Yes. [DING]

347
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,360
But in the entire trip across the Arctic,
they lost... how much water?

348
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,640
GARY: Eight litres.

349
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,840
MATT: Ten.

350
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
A camel's worth.

351
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,680
Chris gets it. 96 litres. [DING]

352
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,600
It's about a camel's worth. That feels about right.

353
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,300
And who did they meet?
We're looking for a very famous physician.

354
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,560
MATT: Doctor Jones? Doctor Jones?

355
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Aqua?

356
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,020
Aqua!

357
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,640
What I like is that you could hear the ripple
of people getting that as it spread about.

358
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,480
No... Albert Schweitzer.

359
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,960
I have never heard that phrase.

360
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
That rings a bell for some reason, but I don't know why.

361
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,340
TOM: 'A French-German theologian,
organist, philosopher, and physician.'

362
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,040
Is 'organist' a subcategory of physician?

363
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,700
TOM: What did Norway send to Schweitzer's hospital?

364
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,160
[Arnold Schwarzenegger voice]  Supplies.

365
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,000
TOM: I mean... okay, I'll need you
to narrow that down a bit.

366
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,300
Because the water melted... some fish to swim in it?

367
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,760
TOM: Oh. You're...  [DING]

368
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,760
No, piss off!

369
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,720
Gary, you keep accidentally saying
something that's close enough.

370
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,940
What would Norway send? Half a ton of fish.

371
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,720
But what kind? What kind of...?

372
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Pickled herring.

373
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,700
[Click]
CHRIS: That didn't go off.

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,880
TOM: [DING] There we go.

375
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,820
TOM: Close enough. Klippfisk.

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
Oh no, that's —

377
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,060
TOM: That actually got an 'Urrgh!' from someone
who has clearly eaten that, in the audience.

378
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,680
Dried and salted cod.

379
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,740
GARY: He's in the middle of the Sahara.
TOM: Yup.

380
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
He's got a doctor's surgery in the middle of the Sahara.

381
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,960
And Norway thinks it's —

382
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,060
TOM: Er, no, it's Gabon.
So they're already a bit south of there.

383
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,880
But Norway thinks it's cool to send a load of
very salty fish to a very dry part of the world.

384
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,860
Yep.

385
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,480
What utter bellends.

386
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,580
[Laughter]

387
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,480
I bet that'd smell nice in 50-degree heat.

388
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,120
'But what's in the box? We've been
waiting for months for this!'

389
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,740
Clunk... 'JESUS CHRIST!'

390
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,300
'What is wrong with them?!'

391
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,160
First of all, they made it.
That's the important thing. They got there...

392
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
It was called 'the greatest publicity stunt of all time'.

393
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,180
They delivered 90 percent of that ice,
without melting, to Libreville.

394
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,680
A representative of the insulation company
met them in Libreville.

395
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,940
MATT: Didn't he go with them?

396
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,700
No, having taken the short route.

397
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,060
GARY: Coward.

398
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,840
He was a friend of someone.
And we talked about him earlier,

399
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,360
and you got a point despite the fact you shouldn't have.

400
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,800
The mayor of Paris?

401
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,540
[Laughter and applause]

402
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,740
TOM: That was...

403
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,380
GARY: Squirrel One: 'Say answer!'
Squirrel Two...

404
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,200
That was a half-court shot, and it sailed
through the air, and it sailed through the air...

405
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,160
and then it just bounced off the rim.

406
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,380
Tom, never use the phrase 'off the rim' in my presence.

407
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,980
TOM: Anyone else want to get the point for that?

408
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,620
MATT: Ze president.

409
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,940
[DING] Absolutely right. President Charles de Gaulle
was a friend of that representative.

410
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,880
Ahh, mais oui.

411
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,180
Did he fly there?

412
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,460
What...?

413
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,880
CHRIS: Airport, mate.
TOM: De Gaulle, oh my God...

414
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,720
Just let it run.

415
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,360
[Applause]

416
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,660
TOM: Yes.

417
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,520
He came with an offer.

418
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,420
What did the representative of that
company say to the expedition

419
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,700
that had got all the way there, got that ice,
got it there almost entirely intact?

420
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,160
'What time d'you call this?'

421
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,140
'Could you just pop it back up to Paris for us?'

422
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
[DING]

423
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,840
He said that if the crew were willing
to drive it back to Paris,

424
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,660
the president himself would receive them
under the Arc de Triomphe.

425
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,960
'Receive' is not a euphemism in that particular case.

426
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,480
Or so you think!

427
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,200
What did they say to that offer?

428
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,340
GARY: Nah.

429
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,540
[DING] Absolutely right.

430
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,580
They were exhausted. They said no.
They said, that is it.

431
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,880
They flew home, they left the ice there with the citizens.

432
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,560
And it was called 'the greatest publicity stunt of all time'.

433
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,740
Did they then go around Radio Luxembourg's
front door, and rap on the door with a bill?

434
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,960
TOM: Radio Luxembourg withdrew the offer.

435
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,080
What?!
Utter f***ers!

436
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,980
Before the expedition set off.

437
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,660
What utter f***ers! Imagine that!

438
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,320
You've got there, 'Radio Luxembourg? I believe I'm rich?'

439
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,900
To be fair, they did withdraw it before the
expedition set off, when it was being planned.

440
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,000
They said they were just joking,
that wasn't what they had in mind.

441
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,820
A radio show has never done that before!

442
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,620
And on that note...
everyone here gets free Mystery Biscuits!

443
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
[Cheering]

444
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,260
Good luck.

445
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,020
On that... congratulations Gary, you win this show!

446
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,360
[Applause]

447
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
GARY: Okay. I'm bracing... bracing. Go on.

448
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,400
You win a tour round a giant underground laboratory,

449
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,280
designed to accelerate flatulence
close to the speed of light.

450
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,240
GARY: No, no, no.
No no no no no...

451
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,920
TOM: It's a farticle accelerator.

452
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,040
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel!

453
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,240
To Gary Brannan!

454
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,800
To Matt Gray!

455
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,800
I've been Tom Scott,

456
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,100
and we will see you after we walk off, pretend it's
the end of the show and walk back on again!

457
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,040
[Applause]
