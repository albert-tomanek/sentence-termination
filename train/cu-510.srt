1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,919
China’s reach in the US is growing

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,200
Some are selling out

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,300
While others stand up

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,140
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,540
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,689
After all the scandal with the NBA selling
out to China,

7
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,490
I’ve decided to start a new segment looking

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,800
at who’s standing up or backing down

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,179
when faced with the Communist Party’s demands.

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,880
I’m calling it Sellout or No Sellout.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,539
League of Legends is the most popular PC game
in the world.

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,460
It was developed by the US company, Riot Games,

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,600
but in 2015 it was bought by the Chinese company
Tencent.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
Users on Reddit discovered the game,

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,019
“appeared to forbid users from changing
their status message

16
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:47,649
to certain words, including ‘Uyghur.’”

17
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,960
Uighurs are the mostly Muslims ethinc minority
in Western China.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,670
The Chinese Communist Party has been putting
them

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,280
in concentration camps.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,239
Riot Games responded to the controversy

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,539
by saying they fixed the error.

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,120
But “words such as ‘genocide’

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,720
and ‘Tiananmen’ in simplified Chinese,

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,110
and ‘great firewall,’

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,930
which refers to China’s blocking of foreign
websites,

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,520
still seem to get weeded out.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,270
League of Legends: what a sellout.

28
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,270
Next up...Blizzard.

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,910
Blizzard got into hot water recently

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,930
for banning a Hong Kong player for supporting
the protests

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,110
during a competition of the Blizzard game
Hearthstone.

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,360
After a global call for a Blizzard boycott,

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,120
the company decided the best way to do damage
control

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,820
was to ban more players for supporting the
Hong Kong protests.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,780
You can see here in the lower corner the players

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,010
holding a sign saying “Free Hong Kong, boycott
Blizz”

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,150
Surely that will be the end of the call to
boycott Blizzard,

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,280
which remains a huge sellout.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Next up Apple CEO Tim Cook!

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,130
Apple and Time Cook have been so widely criticized

41
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,310
for selling out to China,

42
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,820
that even AOC and Ted Cruz are in agreement
on it.

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,770
Which proves climate change is real,

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,860
because hell just froze over.

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,200
“[Apple] faced a wave of criticism earlier
this month

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,140
when it removed a crowdsourced map of Hong
Kong police presence

47
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,320
from the App Store that was used by pro-democracy
protestors.”

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,830
But just to show where Tim Cook’s interests
really lie,

49
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,450
he will join the advisory board

50
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,040
of one of China’s most prestigious universities.

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,950
Tim Cook: proving that Apple is great at selling...out.

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,140
Next up, Quentin Tarantino.

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,310
His latest film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,610
was banned in China.

55
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,410
That’s a big deal because the China market

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,700
means hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket
sales.

57
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,940
But Tarantion says he won’t censor his movie
to get into China.

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,850
Tarantino is no sellout.

59
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,290
Moving on to Magic the Gathering.

60
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,570
Like the video games Blizzard produces,

61
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,430
Magic the Gathering has professional tournaments.

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,690
And like the Blizzard Hearthstone games,

63
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,180
one of the players used the platform

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,010
to talk about the Hong Kong protests.

65
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,490
And he wasn’t banned.

66
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
Amazing!

67
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,910
Not banning a player for having independent
thoughts.

68
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,680
Honestly, finding a US company

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,310
that won’t sell out to China these days

70
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,750
is about as easy as finding a Black Lotus
card.

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,800
I’m just kidding.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,960
I have no idea what that means.

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I’ve never played Magic.

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,290
But I do know that Magic is not for sellouts.

75
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,060
And finally, basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal.

76
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,530
He had this to say about the NBA controversy.

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,069
“As Americans, we do a lot of business in
China,

78
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,930
and they know and understand our values.

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,980
And we understand their values.

80
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,190
And one of our best values here in America
is free speech.

81
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,590
We’re allowed to say what we want to say

82
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,290
and we’re allowed to speak up about injustices,

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,390
and that’s just how it goes...

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,459
Daryl Morey was right.

85
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,069
Whenever you see something wrong going on
anywhere in the world,

86
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,750
you should have the right to say,

87
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,800
‘that’s not right.’”

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Shaq attack!

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,900
Now while he doesn’t play for the NBA anymore,

90
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,959
Shaq does have endorsement deals in China.

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,520
So he’s putting his money where his mouth
is.

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,930
And Shaq is no sellout.

93
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,290
Thanks for playing this edition of Sellout
or No Sellout.

94
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,739
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

95
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,140
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.
