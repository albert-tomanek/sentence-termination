00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Today's show is sponsored by
Jenny Eclair's Electric Chairs:

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,400
You'll have a shocking time!

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,800
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We are playing Citation Needed.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,760
I've got an almost-randomly selected article

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,040
from everybody's favourite reliable source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,240
and these folks can't see it.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,480
Every fact they get right is a point, and a ding [DING],

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,620
and there is a special prize
for particularly good answers, which is...

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,480
And today we are talking about Stefania Follini.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,700
Of course! Stefania Follini of the Wiltshire Follinis,

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,120
if I'm not too mistaken.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,200
Definitely not the Wiltshire Follinis!

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,180
Oh, bollocks. I'm out then!

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,260
Right!

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,040
Broad guess at which country we're insulting today: Italy!

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
Yup! Correct! [DING] Have a point.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,460
Wahey!

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Hold-a onto your pasta pizza lasagna!

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,440
Oh, here we go...

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,500
All right. Sports person?

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
No, not at all. Interior designer, actually...

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,760
From Italy?!

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,780
But that's not what she's famous for.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
She's not famous for anything she did, chaps.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
This is going to be a tough one.

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,120
She's not famous for interior design. She had...

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
Did she drive an Italian car?

28
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,740
No. She, erm... she had an experiment on herself.

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,860
Another head.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,540
[Laughter]

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Don't think medical surgery had got that...

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,080
The world's first two-headed —
you know, that one there, the other one just about here.

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,300
It's about 1989.
Medical science definitely hadn't gotten that far.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Was she trying to work out what would happen

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,380
if you wore the same pair of jeans for three years?

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,180
Whoa.

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,300
Now...

38
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,120
You're wrong. You're obviously massively wrong.

39
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,660
But it is a kind of — it's a self-imposed...

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,360
thing that went on for a hundred and thirty days.

41
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,740
Lived in a hot-air balloon!

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,480
Oh. Lived somewhere, yes.

43
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,740
— In a hot air balloon.
— Under the sea.

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Down where it's wetter.
Down where it's better!

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,040
[Sings]
Under the sea!

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,820
Not quite. You're very close here.

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,000
Underground.

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,020
Yes! In a cave, in fact. [DING]

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,640
For why?

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,620
Interior design purposes?

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,340
No... an experiment about circadian rhythms.

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,480
— You get a point, by the way, just there.
— Ah, thanks.

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Not just a niche in some rock —
we're talking, absolute proper underground...

54
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,000
— Yup.
— A cavern then, rather than a cave.

55
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
'Mites-go-up, 'tites-go-down kind of cave.

56
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,960
Yes. She actually has the women's world record
for longest cave isolation.

57
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,080
Was it presented by Norris McWhirter, that certificate?

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,740
Old school reference!

59
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,840
Thank you!

60
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm reasonably sure I've heard or read somewhere before,

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,600
that in darkness,

62
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,240
the circadian rhythm of a human is about twenty-three hours.

63
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,340
Apparently, it actually drifted towards, first of all, a twenty-eight-hour day,

64
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,560
then a forty-eight-hour one.

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,880
But you're absolutely right, have a point [DING]

66
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,680
for it being away from twenty-four hours.

67
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,580
Does that mean we'd do more in the dark?

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,620
Is that what you're saying?

69
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,840
Away from any reference, away from the sun coming up over here,

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,940
setting over there. Away from that...

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,160
our bodies generally go for 25, 26, 27, 28 hours.

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,040
I am so surprised that a business hasn't set up underground

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,660
just to get longer days out of people.

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,380
I think that's basically the Amazon warehouses.

75
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,380
— Wahey!
— Hmm.

76
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,740
Does that proportion...

77
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,600
Does that mean you might get, I don't know, a three-hour dinner break?

78
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
Actually no — forty-eight hours, it'd be double, wouldn't it?

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,960
Yeah. Well, no, it wouldn't. You'd just work twenty-four more hours.

80
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,420
I can't see them adding an extra...

81
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,380
No, but your dinner break would have to be longer, wouldn't it?

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,600
That depends. I mean, you're the union man here.

83
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,900
I *am* the union man, thank you very much!

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,260
[Singing]
'He is the union man, he comes from far away...'

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
'He can play—'
No he can't, he's on strike.

86
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,220
[Laughter]

87
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,800
And he can negotiate, I think you'll find.

88
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,880
So, obviously she was down in the cave with no external light,

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,420
no clocks, no anything like that.

90
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,000
Wait a minute. She's an interior designer.

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
— Yes.
— She's going to have clocks.

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,480
And cushions, and tables and things like this as well, isn't she?

93
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,360
Throws.

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
Throws!

95
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,800
What do you think she did take down with her?

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,720
A chaise longue.

97
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,480
It's —

98
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Something with big flappy cuffs.

99
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,240
It's describing them here as 'her only companions'.

100
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,120
MDF.

101
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,000
So anything that would keep her spirits up during isolation.

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,980
— Cats.
— Paint.

103
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,860
White spirit.

104
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,680
Desert Island Discs.

105
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,360
White spirit?!
[Laughter]

106
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
'This is a far superior drink to meths!'

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,960
Erm, not quite what... did you say 'cats'?

108
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,540
Yes.

109
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,460
Not quite right.
In fact, you wouldn't want them down there.

110
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,520
Moles!

111
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,460
Ants.

112
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,640
— [Laughing]  I can't take ants with me!
— Dog.

113
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,240
You're going the wrong way down the cartoon food chain.

114
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,620
— A duck!
— Oh, okay. Mice.

115
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,120
Mice. Thank you, point. [DING]

116
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,940
'Two "friendly mice" named Giuseppe and Nicoletta'.

117
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,300
We are in Italy, naturally.

118
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,680
Er, no we're not.
Do you want to take a guess where it was?

119
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
France.

120
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,420
Austria.

121
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,540
Switzerland.

122
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,560
Wrong continent.

123
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,160
— Why the...? Sorry, are there...
— South America then.

124
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
They've got their own f***ing caves!

125
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
Are there no f***ing caves in Europe?

126
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,620
But this was partly organised by NASA.

127
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,320
— Ooh.
— 'Merica!

128
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,160
Hang on! Why did NASA come to an interior designer and say,

129
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,220
'Do you want to live in a cave in... wherever for a year?'

130
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,640
Look, they wanted to use the cave later on,

131
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,120
they needed somebody to fit it out,
and they wanted it done for free.

132
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,020
Can you imagine that?
'Well, er, now you've been down here...

133
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,740
'I just wonder, while you're in, could you, er...

134
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,660
'just zhoosh the place up a bit while you're in?

135
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,140
'I mean, you know, a couple of throws...'

136
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,260
'The feng shui is not quite right.'

137
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,580
'It's not quite — the qi is off...'

138
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,660
'I think we need some of the walls painting, definitely.'

139
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,820
She actually decorated the cave 'with cutouts made from cardboard'.

140
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,820
...of people? Tell me it was of people.
[Laughter]

141
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,960
Er... it doesn't say.

142
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,600
It was like a cutout of Bill Clinton.

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,200
No, it's like that bit from Bugsy Malone,

144
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,980
where they've got one bolted to a little minature railway road so it looks like —

145
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,800
— Isn't that Home Alone?
— Home Alone.

146
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
— And Bugsy Malone as well.
— Really!

147
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,300
Yeah, it is both.

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
When Fat Sam's gang has all been 'killed',

149
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,380
they set up a load of cardboard cutouts...

150
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,760
Maybe the train thing's Home Alone, but...

151
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,380
What else did she take down with her?

152
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
Skateboard.

153
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,840
Not really all that good on a cave floor.

154
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,120
Well, yeah, but something to learn.

155
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,740
Fifteen pounds of LSD.

156
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
'Herbal substances'.

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,140
— Food.
— Yeah, fair point actually.

158
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,180
Well okay, yes, there was food down there, but as companions.

159
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,720
It's actually not that different
from what I'd expect someone in 2014 to...

160
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,380
The voice of Morgan Freeman.

161
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
No, the only way she could communicate
was through one of these.

162
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Morgan Freeman.

163
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
A bat.

164
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,160
— Just a computer, was what I was looking for.
— Sign interpreter.

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Where! In when?

166
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,160
1989. So it was just a text terminal
that talked to the folks at Nasa.

167
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,700
Bear in mind that Nasa's backing this up.

168
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,560
So she's getting light, then, from the screen.

169
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,240
Oh no, it didn't say without light.
It's without natural light.

170
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,760
— Yeah.
— Oh! Sorry, I thought she was in the dark!

171
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,840
No, no!

172
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,020
No, no, she'd just got no outside datum
to tell when it's day and night.

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,040
Oh! But wouldn't the lights turning on and off give you an idea?

174
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,300
No, she's in control of that.

175
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,720
Ohh.

176
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,660
She doesn't know when nighttime is.

177
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,580
Yeah. She can exist as she normally would,

178
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,460
but that then settles down into twenty-eight hours.

179
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,280
This is where the perseverance that you'd need to do the thing

180
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,320
wouldn't pay off for me. I'd just keep a clock going,

181
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,040
and just turn the lights off at the right time.

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,740
Well, that's the thing. She wasn't allowed them.

183
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,360
The computer wouldn't have had a clock.

184
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,840
It would just be a terminal back and forth to tell...
to communicate with people.

185
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,200
Wouldn't you, right, at least on April the first,

186
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
have taken the opportunity to really s*** her up

187
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,700
via that computer terminal?

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,400
If she can't see the outside world,

189
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,420
I'd have just typed the word 'HELP' repeatedly,

190
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
with 'THEY HAVE DONE IT.'

191
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,840
'OH GOD THEY HAVE DONE IT' — repeatedly.

192
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,340
Er. No.

193
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,260
— '89, yeah, that'd be a bit harsh.
— Yeah.

194
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,820
Yeah, but I wouldn't say who 'they' were
and what they'd done.

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,020
It's five years too late, really.

196
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,980
It would turn out all they'd done is block the toilet

197
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,300
in the gents' first floor loo.

198
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,500
She lost a lot of weight while she was in there,

199
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
because obviously her rhythms have spread out,

200
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
so she's taking meals less often, she lost weight.

201
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,720
She actually came out on May the 22nd, 1989.

202
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,080
Is the next question going to be,
what day did she think it was?

203
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,840
Yeah. In fact, you can have a point for correctly guessing

204
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
— ...what I was about to ask there. [DING]
— Nice.

205
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,100
She went in on January 13th,
came out May the 22nd.

206
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,080
— And she thought it was the middle of March?
— And she thought every day was two days?

207
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,140
— Something like that, yeah.
— [DING]  D'you know what...

208
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,660
March the 15th. Exactly the middle of March.

209
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,380
I would have pretended it was later.

210
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,620
Oh, he's claiming his biscuit right now.

211
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
— Get in there.
— That's mine, this is mine...

212
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,480
The room, by the way —
do you want to guess what its size is,

213
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,140
and what it was made of?

214
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,920
Because they actually built a room down in the cave.

215
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
— Hang on!
— Plasterboard.

216
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm rewinding from my admiration.

217
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,240
I thought she was in a pitch-black dark cave, tripping over things...

218
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,620
Dripping things like moss and...

219
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah. Suddenly they've built her a bijou residence down there.

220
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,160
It's hardly a bijou residence.

221
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,540
— Tent.
— Chipboard.

222
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,320
It's a 20-by-12-foot acrylic glass room.

223
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
— Glass?
— Glass?!

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,500
Acrylic glass, yeah.

225
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,000
Why?

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, so she can still see out to the cave,

227
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,920
but she's constricted in movement? Eugh!

228
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,820
Yeah.

229
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,720
Yeee.

230
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,040
Is that the kind of thing they only give them when they go to Mars?

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
That, I think, was one of the reasons, yeah.

232
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,640
It was an experiment on circadian rhythms,

233
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
on how you can survive with no external cues.

234
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,480
But you're trapped in a box that you can see out of,

235
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,860
just to black, which is...

236
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,220
Oh my God, that's horrib... actually, now I see.

237
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,720
The bubble idea, that's even worse.

238
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,320
I thought she might have had a Portakabin or something.

239
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,840
Stefania Follini has the women's world record.

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,340
There is a men's world record for complete isolation,

241
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,440
which is again taken...

242
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,140
Was it the Russians in that thing that's happened recently,

243
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,780
that was three hundred-odd days?

244
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,320
That wasn't underground chamber isloation.

245
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,400
They were still kind of locked in a room.

246
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm not going to make a joke at all —

247
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,260
I'm going to say something like the Chilean miners?

248
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,560
Er, no. It's an Italian sociologist and caver

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
called Maurizio Montalbini.

250
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,060
Who just wanted a really long holiday doing his hobby.

251
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah.

252
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,740
'Er, it's a... study. Yeah! Can I get this paid for?'

253
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,680
Fair point, actually.

254
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,240
The interior designer's cave wasn't her natural environment.

255
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,960
But a caver would like to be in a cave.

256
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,460
Sociologist and caver?

257
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,200
'Hmmm... how can I get this comped?'

258
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,400
That's actually an entire year.

259
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,700
He entered on December the 6th, 1992,

260
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,980
got out December the 5th, 1993.

261
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
After she'd done it, then.
He was going for the proper record.

262
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah. He broke all records...

263
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
thinking it was June the 6th.

264
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,180
So he'd, again, had about double the time
that he thought he'd actually...

265
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,060
Wow, that's a lot more than spinning out

266
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,880
to a twenty-eight-hour rhythm, isn't it?

267
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
Yeah. Well, they said with her as well,

268
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,280
it became a forty-eight-hour rhythm.

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah, twenty-eight to forty-eight. Wow.

270
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,940
Just quoting what it says here —
I'm not sure what this means:

271
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,880
'...his immune defence system fell from a level of 23 to 0'.

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
— NO!
— Dun dun dunnn!

273
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,400
Not zero!! Zero's the worst number!

274
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,280
So presumably there's not a lot living down there,

275
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,300
so it's not fighting stuff off all the time.

276
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,300
— Yeah.
— What are the units here?

277
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
There are no units given in this at all.

278
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,820
This is basically a maths teacher's...

279
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,380
Resistons... seses.

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
All we know is, whatever it is,

281
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,840
if something drops to zero, that's bad.

282
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,600
So above the cave, for Stefania Follini,

283
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,560
there was a trailer.

284
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
For what film?

285
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Just on a loop, endlessly. She went insane.

286
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
When they announced the end of the experiment to her,

287
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,960
you know, they sent down the message saying,
'It's okay, you can come out,'

288
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,540
What do you think she sent back?

289
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,180
And this may be a translation from the Italian

290
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,320
or it may be the original.

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,980
'F*** off?'
Question mark.

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
'I've just got the place looking how I want it!'

293
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,680
You know what? Point. [DING]

294
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,620
It was actually 'Are you really serious?'

295
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,580
But you're absolutely right,
it was a question mark in disbelief.

296
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,740
So I'm giving you the point for that one.

297
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah!

298
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
I also like the newspaper article.

299
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm now looking at the original here that it references.

300
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,740
What happened to her immediately after she came out?

301
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,820
What were the scientists doing to her?

302
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,260
— Poking.
— Probing!

303
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,440
Point! [DING]

304
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
— Poking?
— Yup. Who said 'poking' first?

305
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,280
— One of us.
— Er... one of us, yeah.

306
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,240
— I'm going to give you both points.
— Hahey!

307
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,600
'[P]oked with needles and tagged with electrodes'.

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
Bzzt. Bzzt.

309
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
And then given some vouchers and told to 'enjoy herself'.

310
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,500
'Here's one free McDonald's —

311
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,220
'oh no, your immune system's dropped, hasn't it.'

312
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,400
'Don't eat it!'

313
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,860
What's surprising me here is,

314
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,160
now I'm looking this up, I've just made a connection here...

315
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,100
because there's the article from the Daily News in 1989:

316
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Experiment coordinator?

317
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,220
Maurizio Montalbini.

318
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,100
[Laughter]

319
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,300
Ooh! Ooh!

320
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,540
I'll put my tinfoil hat on for that one, thank you very much.

321
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,860
The guy who later went on to break the record again,

322
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,660
was the experiment coordinator.

323
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,860
Presumably because he is the world's expert

324
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,260
on staying in a cave for a long time.

325
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,140
On staying in a hole, yeah.

326
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,900
He learned all he needed to know
and then used it against her.

327
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,680
He was like, 'F*** doing it first.'

328
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
'It could kill me! Let some other f***er do it.'

329
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,280
While she's down there, all the time he's just sat there,

330
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
rubbing his hands and going, 'SOON.'

331
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,440
I just like the idea that he just went...

332
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,760
'Right, I need to do this experiment prior to mine...

333
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
'What profession to choose?

334
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
'Who will be hardiest against these hardships?'

335
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,700
[Together]
'Interior designers!'

336
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,340
You're actually, with the whole rubbing hands...

337
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
'Miss Follini', it says,

338
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,520
'heard a human voice other than her own' for the first time.

339
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,540
'Stefania, I am your God, talking to you.'

340
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
— Whoaa!
— Dude had issues!

341
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,340
Of all the things he could have said!

342
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,460
He'd be laying in bed going,
'What do I say? What do I say?'

343
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,720
'What do I say? Argh!'

344
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,400
'I know! "This is your God talking to you!"'

345
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,840
I like the idea that he hired James Mason
just to make sure it sounded right.

346
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,340
The last thing, then,
is a quote from a news article about this.

347
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,920
'She dismisses concern that her contribution to science was an ordeal.'

348
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,460
What did she say it was instead?

349
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,540
'It was all right, really.'

350
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,240
— Time to think.
— Cheap holiday.

351
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,460
You know, I'm going to give Gary the point on that.

352
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,580
'It was a very simple thing.' [DING]

353
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
Urgh. Yeah. Yes it is.

354
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,860
Oh, I like her. Her answers to questions are good.

355
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,400
I assume she was allowed books.

356
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,400
Yes.

357
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,060
Well, the books that she took in.

358
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,980
And a guitar.

359
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Oh God.

360
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,020
I knew there'd be a guitar.

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,820
That's a fair point, though. You are going to Mars,

362
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,560
there's what, five, six of you or something?

363
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
You're getting on there, you strap yourself into the capsule...

364
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,560
There's going to be that one dickhole,

365
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
just playing 'Smoke On The Water' over and over again,
[Laughter]

366
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,860
— on a s***ty twenty-quid acoustic guitar.
— [Groans]

367
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
And he's got it slung over the back of his space suit:

368
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,640
'Hey guys, I brought this along!'

369
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,300
Oh, f***. 'Kumbaya'  for the rest of eternity.

370
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,260
There was a moment when I was a fresher,

371
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,240
that someone directly above me, in the room above me

372
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,040
was playing 'Smoke On The Water'
and just trying to learn it.

373
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
I just remember,
'Dun — dun — dunnn...'

374
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,540
After about five minutes of this, I just hear:

375
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,820
Door slams —
stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp...

376
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,060
Door opens.

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,960
Clunk!
[Electrical buzzing]

378
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,540
He pulls the plug out.

379
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,760
Door slams — stomp, stomp...

380
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,180
Not a word said.

381
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,580
Either that or someone gets in the space capsule with a guitar,

382
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
or hauls in an accordion or something.

383
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,340
[Tuneless noise]

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
'I think we've got room for this, don't you?'

385
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,860
[hums] 'Captain Pugwash!'

386
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
A harmonica. Just one of the sunsets, lying there going,

387
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,800
[Western harmonica]

388
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,900
I love the idea that she's not down there
with some acoustic thing,

389
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,540
that she's got, like a two-hundred-watt Fender stack,

390
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
and a Gibson SG,

391
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,200
mirror hat, just rockin' out in this cave.

392
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,660
[à la Metallica]
'Master! Master!'

393
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,420
Yeaaaah!

394
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
To be fair, there are astronauts on the ISS —

395
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,940
I mean, Chris Hadfield was one —
who took their guitar up with them.

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
On space musician facts, though...

397
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
Neil Armstrong took a theremin to the Moon, didn't he?

398
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,400
— Did he?!
— Did he?

399
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,460
I have *never* heard that before.

400
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,880
Yeah, I think he took a theremin with him.

401
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,520
'Screw this, guys. It's not gonna sound spacey enough without it!'

402
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,280
All: [Theremin sounds]  Woo-oo!

403
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Yeah, but the way you play a theremin, can you imagine?

404
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
You're in the capsule, and Neil Armstrong's like...

405
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,060
Woooo-ooooo!

406
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,660
That's not strictly true, but I can tell you

407
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,420
that we have an article here called 'Music Out of the Moon'.

408
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,280
A cassette tape of that was taken...

409
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh. Fair enough.

410
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,080
...by Neil Armstrong, to the moon,
and he played it back to them

411
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Oh thanks, Neil. Brilliant.

412
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,180
Just that bloke, when you're trying to drive,

413
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,860
you know, really concentrate,
and someone puts their friggin' CD on.

414
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,780
That's him with his theremin music, innit.

415
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,300
'Brought this! Woooooo!'
...for his Moon landing moment.

416
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,860
All right. At the end of the show, congratulations Gary —

417
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,260
DAAAAH! YES! YESSS!

418
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,920
...you win this one.

419
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
GET IN THERE!

420
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,960
So excited, his hood came off!

421
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,700
I'm kind of disappointed that...

422
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
...kind of disappointed that he's not wearing a parka,

423
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,460
so he can sort of put it over his head like Batman.

424
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,280
YES!

425
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,820
BOOM!

426
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
That's what we play the game for!

427
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

428
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
You win a trip to the edge of the atmosphere

429
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
with the host of the '90s game show Small Talk.

430
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,900
Oh, really!

431
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,600
It's Ronnie Corbett Low Earth Orbit.

432
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
So do enjoy that. In the meantime...

433
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,020
— That's been Matt Gray...
— Bye-bye!

434
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,400
That's been Gary Brannan...

435
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,860
That's been Chris Joel.

436
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,740
I have been Tom Scott.
We'll see you next time.

437
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,480
Thanks for watching!

438
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
Tell us if you liked it, or even better, tell someone else.

439
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,180
