1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,060
New Zealand—the destination of choice

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,240
for fabulously wealthy Chinese.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,240
After the United States, Australia, Thailand,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,740
Canada, and the UK.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
That’s why I came to New Zealand.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,640
To see all it has to offer!

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,460
My first stop was in Karaka.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,119
I came to see this stunning, brand-new,

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,460
ultra-modern 4,000 square foot, luxury lifestyle
home,

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,989
sitting on 10 acres of lush countryside.

11
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,960
With four sun-drenched bedrooms,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,620
an expansive high-end kitchen,

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,620
and floor-to-ceiling windows.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,500
Plus a heated saltwater pool complete with
gas fireplace.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,460
I couldn’t wait to get the tour.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,730
So what does a home like this go for?

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,460
Well this property is going to auction

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,000
and we would expect interest

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,590
at upwards of three million.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,110
It is a brand new home,

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,240
it's only one and a half years old.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,810
Everything's brand new here.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,810
Wow.

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,710
Similar properties have sold in the

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,140
four to five million dollars around the area.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,630
Four to five million dollars in the area?

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,630
Yes.

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,200
So it is a premium area in Karaka.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,979
Is New Zealand still a hot property market

30
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:31,979
for Chinese buyers?

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,500
I think New Zealand will always be

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,240
a hot property market for Chinese buyers

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,990
because of what it offers.

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,260
Why are they attracted to this area?

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,140
I think it's due to, well,

36
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,500
it's the beautiful environment that Karaka
offers,

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,270
the lovely openness,

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,490
green pastures, fresh air.

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,049
There's a very good private school close by,

40
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,670
we do have quite a lot of Chinese people

41
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,040
looking in the area.

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,340
How many homes in the area

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,760
are going to Chinese buyers?

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,740
Well, the Chinese buyers,

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,780
they've been in the market quite some time
now.

46
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,849
I haven't got a percentage

47
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,269
but the last two properties that I've sold
in Karaka

48
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,050
have been to Chinese buyers.

49
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,060
How have Chinese buyer affected the property
market?

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,740
They've offered...

51
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,100
yeah, certainly they've offered competition
for local buyers.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,720
Has that affected the prices of the houses
at all?

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,540
A little bit, yes, yes.

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,860
Yes, it has.

55
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,319
Turns out, more than a bit.

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,010
According to this report from the Economist,

57
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,790
New Zealand has the most unaffordable houses
in the world.

58
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,360
Prices have jumped 75 percent in four years,

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,770
largely because of foreign buyers.

60
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,910
And the majority of those are Chinese.

61
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,159
Karaka was so nice that I was thinking of

62
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,910
becoming a foreign buyer myself.

63
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,900
But I couldn’t spend all day lounging by

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,510
the heated saltwater pool.

65
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,460
I had more luxury homes to visit.

66
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,500
So I was off to Auckland, New Zealand’s
biggest city,

67
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,000
to check out one of its most sought-after
neighborhoods.

68
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,159
I spoke with real estate agent Diana West.

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,900
She offered to show me a 3 million dollar
suburban home.

70
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,960
It was...a different kind of luxury.

71
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,409
So this house will most likely go

72
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,000
for over 3 million dollars?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
Absolutely

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,909
And so what is the draw to a location like
this?

75
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,830
Is it the stunning luxury lifestyle?

76
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,830
Well when you get rid of this

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,860
and build your luxury home it will be.

78
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,159
But it’s the location for the school zones,

79
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,470
you’ve got Auckland Grammar,

80
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,530
Ipsen Girls Grammar,

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,500
so it’s actually the land value here.

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,750
Because it’s such, once you get rid of this
house,

83
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,930
and build two luxury homes here,

84
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,300
they will be worth easily $3.5 million dollars
each.

85
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,400
In this property market,

86
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,250
how many homes are going to Chinese buyers?

87
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,890
I’d say 80-90%.

88
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,890
80-90$?!

89
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,300
How has that affected the property prices?

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,390
Well it’s driven them up hugely

91
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,230
because we’ve got an influx of population

92
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,970
and seemingly with a lot of funds available

93
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,600
and that has actually driven out a lot of
the local buyers.

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,790
Has that caused resentment?

95
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,120
Yeah it does.

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,890
For a number of years in fact,

97
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,400
the local Kiwi people wouldn’t come to auctions

98
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,950
because they said what’s the point?

99
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,460
We’re going to get beaten so yeah,

100
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,530
there has been resentment.

101
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,330
Okay, so 10 years ago

102
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,650
how much would a house like this have gone
for?

103
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,410
Probably a million.

104
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,580
A million.

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,540
So prices have basically doubled.

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,390
Or tripled in this case.

107
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,600
Because what’s happened in the meantime

108
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,570
was the council has changed all the zoning
rules,

109
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,840
so you’ve got properties like this

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,950
that would have just been one house,

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,450
and now have the ability for multiple dwellings.

112
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,390
Are Chinese buyers still as interested in
this property market?

113
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,140
There has been a little cooling.

114
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,110
We find in general the Chinese

115
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,640
are the first to get on the bandwagon

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,110
when they perceive there’s a lot of growth
in the market,

117
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,130
then, in general,

118
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,570
they are the first to recede and start to
become cautious

119
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,800
when they see the market plateauing

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,050
and that’s what we believe we’re doing
at the moment.

121
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,110
The market is cooling a bit.

122
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,110
Yes \hit is, a little bit.

123
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,940
Do you think it will ever go back to the pricing
of 10 years ago,

124
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,410
before the influx of Chinese buyers.

125
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,160
No, no there’s just too much population
pressure in Auckland.

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,660
Okay.

127
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,380
Particularly in these well sought after suburbs.

128
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,140
Trying to tackle this problem,

129
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,700
the government proposed new laws

130
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,820
regulating foreign buyers.

131
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,100
But Diana thinks its too little too late.

132
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
There are proposed laws

133
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,600
that would restrict foreign buyers.

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,980
Do you see that affecting the market?

135
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
No I don’t,

136
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,520
I think it’s a bit like shutting the gate

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,350
after the horse has bolted.

138
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,110
The real change we saw here

139
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,110
was when they brought in

140
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,000
the Bright-lLine Tax rules several years ago,

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,900
and that requirement was for people

142
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,440
to have a New Zealand bank account

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,190
and a New Zealand IRD number,

144
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,070
and that stopped a lot of the foreign speculation

145
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,620
happening from people who did not live here

146
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,300
because they couldn’t comply with those
rules.

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,750
And so that’s when we stopped seeing all
that happening.

148
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,670
So really, the people who have been buying

149
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,950
for the last couple of years

150
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,720
are generally resident or applying for residency.

151
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,860
So I don’t see this ban on foreign ownership

152
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,240
having any difference at all.

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,420
I realized that to be able to afford property
in New Zealand,

154
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,700
I would need to be fabulously wealthy

155
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,690
to be just moderately well off.

156
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,210
Which gives me an idea....

157
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,080
Welcome to Lifestyles of the Moderately Well
Off!

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
Life is slightly better

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,900
for the fabulously wealthy in New Zealand.

160
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Luxury pools

161
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,920
Luxurious lounges

162
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,850
Exotic animals

163
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,950
All on the doorstep of your 3 million dollar
dream home.

164
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,880
Behold what the world has to offer

165
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,620
on Lifestyles of the Moderately Well Off!

166
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,850
So I might never be able to own

167
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,500
a luxury property in New Zealand.

168
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,340
But you know what?

169
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,640
Even without a house,

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,460
I can still enjoy the moderately well off
lifestyle.
