00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,560
the biggest China news today.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,869
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:13,150
I’m in Hong Kong this week

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,490
as part of our Pivot to Asia Tour.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,029
And if you’ve been following the situation
here,

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,970
you’d know that huge things are happening.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,970
On Friday,

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,089
pro-Beijing forces in the Hong Kong government

11
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,789
made a move that could expel four pro-democracy
lawmakers

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:27,789
from office.

13
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,099
And that could open doors for the government

14
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,349
to pass an anti-subversion law

15
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,250
that could be the biggest threat to freedom

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,610
that Hong Kong has faced in 20 years!

17
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,930
Not to mention it makes a mockery out of Hong
Kong's democratic process

18
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,620
and the one country, two systems policy

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,731
that's supposed to protect the people of Hong
Kong

20
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:50,200
and shows the Chinese Communist Party's increasing
encroachment here.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,210
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,900
Oh, everyone wants me to talk about Donald
Trump instead.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,800
Apparently, the US president-elect has,

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,500
shall we say,

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,120
trumped all this seriously freedom-threatening
news by...

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,720
making a phone call to the president of Taiwan.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,360
Or as Trump claimed on Twitter,

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,280
she totally called him first.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,500
Now what’s the big deal?

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,990
Presidents of lots of countries have called
to congratulate Trump.

31
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,020
The difference is: Taiwan is not a country!

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,390
Just ask the Chinese Communist Party.

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,000
They claim Taiwan as a province of China,

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,970
and have forced almost every other country—

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,820
including the United States—

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,290
to agree to the “One China” policy.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,490
That’s where everyone collectively pretends
Taiwan

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,950
is somehow not an independent country—

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,340
despite it having its own government, currency,
and military.

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,970
So to avoid upsetting the Chinese Communist
Party,

41
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,520
no US president or president-elect

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,580
has had a direct phone call with a Taiwanese
president

43
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,229
in 40 years.

44
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,729
Instead, the US has an unofficial relationship
with Taiwan,

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,979
in which we promise to help them defend themselves

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,520
if China invades,

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,690
but we can't refer to them as a government.

48
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,799
Until Donald Trump.

49
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,519
That’s a phrase I think I’m going to be
hearing a lot

50
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,219
over the next four years.

51
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,219
Anyway,

52
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,579
Chinese officials expressed their anger over
this incident—

53
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:19,189
also a phrase I think I’m going to be hearing
a lot

54
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,819
over the next four years.

55
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,330
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave reporters

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,720
the standard line on Friday,

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,290
about how "Adherence to the ‘One China’
policy is the cornerstone

58
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,329
of the healthy development,” yada yada yada.

59
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,540
Chinese officials also lodged a formal diplomatic
protest with the US.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,640
Now some people in the lamestream media

61
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,120
say Donald Trump had the phone call because
of his business interests

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,239
in Taiwan, like plans to build Trump Hotels
there.

63
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,799
Others claim he did it out of ignorance

64
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,909
of the nuanced diplomatic relationship.

65
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,909
But maybe...

66
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,069
he’s just trolling China.

67
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,440
It would be a bold move to change the US policy
toward Taiwan.

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,970
It's just not clear if that's what's actually
happening.

69
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,930
And one possible repercussion here

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,849
is that the Chinese Communist Party won't
make a fuss with the US,

71
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,230
but will instead take out their anger on Taiwan.

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,670
What's that Shelley?

73
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,350
Oh.

74
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,780
That's already happened.

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,750
Anyway, now that the US media has obsessed
over this phone call

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,299
like high school girls freaking out over a
text

77
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,639
with the most popular guy in school,

78
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,870
maybe we can get back to talking about the
apparently

79
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,739
second most important piece of China news
today.

80
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:34,739
Hong...

81
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,539
Wait, what's that Shelley?

82
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:40,840
What do you think?

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,439
Leave your comments below.

84
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,749
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

85
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:44,889
See you next time.
