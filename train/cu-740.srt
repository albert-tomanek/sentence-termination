00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,200
Flooding in China sparks a massive explosion

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
A monkey virus kills

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,840
And China is buying up American farmland

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,560
Massive flooding is once again devastating China.\h\h

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,720
At least 33 people have died in\h
Henan province, in central China.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,360
Chinese state-run media have called it\h
the heaviest rain there in 1000 years.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
Henan experienced almost a year’s\h
worth of rainfall in three days.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,680
How severe is the flooding? Pretty severe.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Cars were being swept away like leaves.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
I’d be a little more freaked\h
out if I were this guy.\h

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
And you may remember the problem China\h
has with sinkholes from a recent episode.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,440
Unfortunately, the flooding has not helped.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,000
Also, apparently floodwaters\h
can make factories explode.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,760
This is what’s left of an aluminium alloy plant.

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
It was quite the explosion.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
And it could be seen from quite a distance.
But that’s not even as scary as what happened to a\h\h

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,640
subway line in the city of Zhengzhou, the\h
capital of Henan. After water burst through\h\h

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,760
a retaining wall near a subway station,\h
water started pouring into the tunnels.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,160
People were trapped in flooded subway\h\h

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
cars. And I would definitely be a\h
little more freaked out if I were them.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
These people were evacuated\h
from drowning subway cars.\h

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
According to official figures,\h
around 500 people were evacuated,\h\h

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,600
while tragically, at least 12 people died\h
while trapped in the flooding subway.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
The suddenness of the flooding\h
took people by surprise.\h\h

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Thankfully, people were able\h
to pull this woman to safety.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
But in the aftermath of the floods,\h
hundreds of people are still missing,\h\h

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,000
judging from posts on Chinese social media. And\h
the death toll is likely to rise. Although we’ll\h\h

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
probably never know the true death toll, since\h
Chinese authorities suppress that information.\h

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,720
And now locals are asking why authorities\h
weren’t more prepared for the floods.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Residents are questioning inaccurate weather\h
forecasts and a confusing disaster alert system.\h\h

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,640
And even why officials didn’t shut the\h
subway down after the flooding began.

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,320
Some are even wondering whether\h
the officials’ decision to open\h\h

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,880
reservoirs to release floodwater also\h
contributed to the massive flooding.\h\h

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,200
If it did, then I fully expect Chinese\h
authorities to also suppress that information.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
More China news after the break.

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,480
Welcome back.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,880
It’s the book release we were all waiting\h
for—the Compilation of Xi Jinping’s Discourses on\h\h

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Full and Strict Governance Over the Party!
It’s so exciting that the official Xinhua news\h\h

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,720
agency published a...one-sentence article about\h
it. Well, someone’s going to a re-education camp.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,000
Anyway, the book is a real page turner. A\h
compilation of over 220 reports, speeches,\h\h

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,960
articles, and instructions by\h
Xi Jinping, from 2012 to 2021.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,240
And guess what? It turns out Xi is not\h
a fan of democracy. Who’d have guessed\h\h

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,200
presitator for life Xi\h
Jinping would feel that way?

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,480
In January 2018, Xi delivered a speech to the\h
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\h\h

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,680
That’s basically his anti-corruption police force\h
that has been purging all his political opponents.

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,080
Here’s what he said, “As the strict overall\h
governance of the Party continues to intensify,\h\h

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,240
there are also some murmurs\h
of noise within the Party.”

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,680
Those murmurs were calls for intra-Party\h
democracy, rather than, shall we say,\h\h

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,880
more centralized leadership. Two months after\h
that speech, Xi amended China’s Constitution,\h\h

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,960
so he could effectively be presitator for life.
Now this is important to remember about factional\h\h

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,640
infighting within the Chinese Communist Party.\h
Xi didn’t make himself leader for life for fun.\h\h

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,040
Just like those in the Party that\h
were calling for intra-Party democracy\h\h

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,280
weren't good-guy reformers. Remember, they\h
weren’t saying give Chinese people a vote.

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,120
There are no heroes in everyone’s favorite\h
communist soap opera General Hostility.

57
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,280
As you know if you’ve been watching, Xi Jinping\h
is locked in a life or death power struggle\h\h

58
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,920
with a faction tied to former Chinese leader\h
and Battletoad-reject Jiang Zemin. Intra Party\h\h

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,080
democracy would have taken power away from Xi\h
and put it into the hands of the Jiang faction.

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,080
And remember, in a communist\h
power struggle, no one wins.

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,560
The key takeaway, no matter what you might hear,\h\h

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,680
is the Chinese Communist Party will never\h
reform. When US politicians or businesses\h\h

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,960
talk about working with the Communist\h
Party, they are being idiots.

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,280
The Party isn’t building all those\h
new missile silos for our health.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaking of our health, a year\h
after declaring a pandemic,\h\h

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
the World Health Organization is finally\h
calling for audits of the Wuhan labs.

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,840
I mean how much evidence\h
could the Chinese Communist\h\h

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
Party possibly destroy in just a year’s time?

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,920
But I don’t want to criticize the WHO\h\h

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,840
that much. I’m sure they’ve learned many\h
lessons from the coronavirus pandemic.\h\h

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Just in time for China to report its first\h
human death from the rare Monkey B virus.

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,320
The 53 year old man was a veterinarian. He\h
was dissecting two dead monkeys and got sick.\h\h

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,200
It’s rare for humans to contract the Monkey\h
B virus—a form of herpes that causes brain\h\h

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,280
swelling in humans. Since most people aren’t at\h
risk of coming in contact with monkey fluids,\h\h

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
it’s pretty rare in humans.

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,600
However, while the Monkey B virus is\h
deadly, it’s not as bad as the Monkey C\h\h

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,720
virus, which causes radical behavioral\h
changes. After all, Monkey C, monkey do.

78
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
More bad news for Hong Kong’s Apple Daily.\h
Which is surprising since the Hong Kong\h\h

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,320
government already drove the company out\h
of business. How much worse could it get?

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,360
Well, Hong Kong national security police\h
arrested 3 more top staff of the paper,\h\h

81
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
including the former editor in chief.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,200
It’s not entirely clear what they’re being\h
charged with, but I think it's pretty clear\h\h

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,840
Hong Kong authorities don’t need much of\h
a reason to arrest anyone these days. 
 

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Speaking of the continued communist takeover\h
of Hong Kong, staff at Hong Kong’s public\h\h

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,000
broadcaster are no longer allowed to call Taiwan\h
a country, or refer to its leader as a president.

86
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
So Taiwan’s democratically\h
elected president, Tsai-ing Wen,\h\h

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
must be called “the most senior leader of Taiwan”\h\h

88
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,000
while Xi Jinping, who was elected by nobody,\h
must be called “president.” It makes total sense.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
China is suffering from a\h
massive demographic crisis.

90
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
It was caused by decades of\h
state-run family planning.\h\h

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
In other words, forced\h
abortions and sterliziations.

92
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
Well, for the first time in\h
decades, the CCP has lifted\h\h

93
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
baby fines for people who have\h
more children than allowed.

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,640
Currently there’s a three-child policy. But now,\h
you won’t be fined if you have more. Supposedly.\h\h

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,120
We’ll see how local officials handle it.

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
But this should give you some idea\h
of just how desperate the CCP is\h\h

97
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,880
for people to start having babies. Of\h
course for all the people who have been\h\h

98
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,880
forcibly sterilized, the new changes\h
probably don’t mean all that much.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,960
And after the break, Chinese people might\h
not want to have more kids, but that hasn’t\h\h

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
stopped the Chinese Communist\h
Party from screwing the US.

101
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,640
Welcome back.

102
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Over the past decade, China has hacked\h
dozens of US pipeline companies.

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
And this wasn’t about stealing\h
technology. Oh no. Much worse.

104
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,680
According to the FBI and Homeland Security,\h\h

105
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
“these intrusions were likely intended to\h
gain strategic access to the [pipeline]\h\h

106
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
networks for future operations rather\h
than for intellectual property theft.”

107
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,080
In other words, they weren't stealing\h
the technology. Chinese hackers\h\h

108
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
wanted to be able to seize\h
control of them in the future.\h\h

109
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,600
So Blackrock, tell me more about how we\h
should be investing in Chinese bonds.

110
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
But if you want more proof that no one\h
is taking the China threat seriously,\h\h

111
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,720
the US military has been buying Chinese cameras\h
in violation of America’s own China sanctions!

112
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,880
We’re talking video surveillance equipment with\h
known national security risks. But the military\h\h

113
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,040
didn’t buy them directly from China. No no\h
no. They bought them from American resellers\h\h

114
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,400
who totally said they didn’t violate US sanctions.\h\h

115
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
Gives me a lot of confidence\h
in US military intelligence.

116
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,840
In more good news, guess who’s buying\h
up American farms? Besides Bill Gates.

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
The answer is, China.

118
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,640
Yes, China might someday control America’s\h
food supply. I can’t see that going wrong.

119
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,720
“By the start of 2020, Chinese\h
owners controlled about 192,000\h\h

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,880
agricultural acres in the\h
U.S., worth $1.9 billion.”

121
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,360
That’s still a small percentage of the nearly\h
900 million acres of total American farmland.\h\h

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,480
So it’s not an immediate problem, but it’s\h
something we should definitely do something about.

123
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
But in some good news, there is\h
bipartisan agreement this is bad.\h\h

124
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Because, you know, national security.\h\h

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,720
And I’m talking like, Mike Pence and Elizabeth\h
Warren are in agreement. That’s amazing. To see\h\h

126
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
a white man and a Native American woman setting\h
aside their differences for the common good.

127
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
And this week marks the 22 year anniversary of the\h\h

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown\h
on the Falun Gong spiritual practice.\h

129
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
US State Department Spokesperson\h
Ned Price had this to say.

130
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,320
We recognize 22 years since the People’s\h
Republic of China launched a campaign of\h\h

131
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,840
repression against the Falun Gong movement and\h
its millions of practitioners, advocates, and the\h\h

132
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,200
human rights defenders working to protect their\h
rights...We call on the PRC to immediately cease\h\h

133
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,560
its campaign against Falun Gong practitioners and\h
release those imprisoned due to their beliefs.

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Back in May, the State Department sanctioned a\h\h

135
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
Chinese official involved\h
in persecuting Falun Gong.

136
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
And even former Secretary of\h
State Mike Pompeo spoke out.

137
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
“With respect to Falun Gong, the absence\h
of religious freedom in China is horrific,\h\h

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
it is tragic, it’s gone on for too long and\h
America needs to lead the world to ensure\h\h

139
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,960
that those people have the opportunity to\h
practice their faith in the way they want to.”

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,360
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also issued\h\h

141
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,520
a statement condemning the Communist\h
Party’s campaign against Falun Gong.

142
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,840
As did at least 15 other US\h
lawmakers, like Senator Marco Rubio

143
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,920
As well as the Inter-Parliamentary\h
Alliance on China,\h\h

144
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
an international coalition of\h
politicians from 20 countries.

145
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,080
So considering former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin\h
said he’d wipe out Falun Gong in three months\h\h

146
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,920
back in 1999, I’d say this campaign majorly\h
backfired for the Chinese Communist Party.

147
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,000
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
fans who support us and our efforts to expose\h
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

149
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,640
by contributing through crowd\h
funding website Patreon.

150
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,240
Ringleader asks, “Knowing that the\h
PLA and it's "military leadership"\h\h

151
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,120
have no real combat/war fighting experience, plus\h
it's extreme corruption, what are the odds that\h\h

152
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
the CCP could really succeed in a real invasion\h
against the independent nation of Taiwan?”\h

153
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,080
That is the big question, isn’t it? The\h
Chinese military is basically completely\h\h

154
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,920
untested. That’s a huge advantage\h
for the defense of Taiwan.

155
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,040
Not to mention China would be facing a\h
coalition of forces defending Taiwan.\h\h

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
Besides the US, Japan said\h
it would likely get involved.

157
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,120
The real advantage the Chinese Communist\h
Party has is the fact that basically\h\h

158
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,040
everything today is made in China. The US is\h
entirely dependent on China for things like\h\h

159
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,080
aspirin and antibiotics. That’s an\h
advantage the Chinese regime will keep\h\h

160
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,000
pressing. Then there’s the wild-card factor\h
of China’s space weapons. If they really\h\h

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,480
could blind US satellites, that really would\h
impact the US military’s ability to coordinate.

162
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,600
But China would still be facing some pretty big\h
obstacles to a successful invasion of Taiwan.\h\h

163
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,200
But an unsuccessful invasion of Taiwan?\h
Well, that’s a whole ‘nother story.

164
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Thanks for your question and\h
your support, Ringleader.
