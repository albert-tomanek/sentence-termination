00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,990
just because you might be a little evil,

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,849
doesn’t mean you can’t be A LOT cool.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,120
“I’m with it. I’m hip.”

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,920
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,360
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,699
Kids these days.

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,830
They have no idea what it was like in China’s
good old days of full-on communism.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,790
You know, when the government took care of
its citizens.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,100
People respected tradition.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,309
And neighbors treated each other with kindness.

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,179
But oh! How to get the youth interested in
communism again?

13
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,039
All you need is to change your image!

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,129
You've had your communist takeover,

15
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,969
but now it's time for your communist makeover.

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,769
You know, a little less young Lenin,

17
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,069
and a little more young Stalin.

18
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,619
And you thought Che Guevara had the best communist
hairdo.

19
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,649
Anyway, that’s exactly what the Chinese
regime wants to do.

20
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,860
Get this generation of young Chinese to realize
Communism is totally lit!

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,610
And since communism came from the West,

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,860
China’s thought leaders knew exactly where
to look for inspiration.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,060
And this is what they came up with.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, that is a Chinese hip hop song about
Karl Marx,

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,550
the founder of communism.

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,500
It’s called “Marx is a Post-90s.”

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,240
That is, the generation born after 1990,

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,820
which is the Chinese equivalent of saying
"Marx is a millennial."

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,760
It’s got lines like “I’m your Bruno
Mars,

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,800
but you’re my Venus, Karl Marx,”

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,170
and “communism is as sweet as honey.”

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,370
And apparently, it's gone viral.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,370
Now, it may be hard at first to see the connections
between rap and the proletarian revolution,

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,250
but I would argue that in China,

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,080
Communist Party officials are the ones truly
living the baller lifestyle.

36
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,770
They've got their bling.

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,019
And they've got their side pieces.

38
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,359
This guy had 18 mistresses.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,780
This guy!

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,239
This guy had 140!

41
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,379
And like Jay-Z,

42
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,349
many officials found that it didn't pay to
get caught with Becky with the good hair.

43
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,420
And their kids are part of what's known in
China as the fuerdai,

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
the second generation rich,

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,629
who are infamous for a different kind of party
lifestyle.

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,180
You see,

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,409
hip hop is a natural way to connect the Communist
Party with the youth of today!

48
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,939
What's that Shelley?

49
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,579
Ok, so apparently that Karl Marx rap

50
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,819
is the theme song of a nine-episode TV series
called “Marx is Trustworthy.”

51
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,969
Which is is a "reading show" for young people.

52
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,299
Is this some kind of twisted Reading Rainbow?

53
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,389
What's next, Reeducation Camp Rock?

54
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,620
Sesame Commune?

55
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,239
And I’m sure after watching it,

56
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,419
kids are going to think communism is totally
sick.

57
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,469
Sick as in in “cool.”

58
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:11,349
Not sick as in the philosophy that inspired
two of history’s deadliest dictators.

59
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Anyway, the hip hop videos don’t stop with
Marx.

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Want to make Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign sound cool?

61
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,100
And of course, there’s the People’s Liberation
Army recruiting video.

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,880
Oh, Communist Party! You’ve made killing
people cool again.

63
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,730
You know, the idea behind the Marx rap sounds
familiar somehow…

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,680
Using hip hop to dramatize the life of a prominent
historical figure

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,220
in a way that appeals to the masses and becomes
wildly popular.

66
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
“But Hamilton forgets

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,040
His plan would have the government

68
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,420
Assume states’ debts.

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,820
Now place your bets

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,120
at who that benefits?

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,599
The very seat of government

72
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,919
where Hamilton sits.

73
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,329
Not true!”

74
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,730
Wait a minute, are we about to get Marx the
musical?!

75
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,279
I'm sure it will be a runaway smash.

76
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,419
Of the “four olds.”

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,540
So what do you think China’s propaganda ministry

78
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,510
should make a rap song about next?

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,140
Are you looking forward to hearing the Karl
Marx mixtape?

80
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,680
Leave your comments below.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,200
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.
