1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,869
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,569
The Chinese military wants a pay raise.

3
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,509
A tragic medical affliction

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,260
may be plaguing Chinese dissidents.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
And finally,

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,530
with new Chinese tariffs,

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,360
we’ll see a rise in the price of tinfoil
hats.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,540
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,640
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,830
China is gearing up for another meeting

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,880
of the National People’s Congress.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,529
It’s a time when everyone in the Chinese
government

14
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,160
vies for power.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,410
Including Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,820
More on that later,

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,750
but this is also the time when the budget

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,000
for 2018 gets set.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,290
And everyone wants a piece of the pie.

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,190
Especially the military.

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,460
“China may have the world’s largest military,

22
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,750
but for some it’s not enough.

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,190
As Beijing gets ready to release

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,350
its defense budget for the year,

25
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,250
sources told Reuters that top brass

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,150
are pushing for a big bump in spending,

27
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,770
to combat modern threats.”

28
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,010
I mean, can you blame them?

29
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,180
It’s not cheap to build

30
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,600
your capture the flag courses

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,990
out of LEGOs!

32
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,210
China is second to only the United States

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,020
on military spending.

34
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,780
Of course, “China’s defense spending

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,829
is only about one-quarter that of the United
States,

36
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,560
if official figures are accurate.”

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,189
Which is a big if.

38
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,189
But still,

39
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,530
they barely have enough to make

40
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,060
a proper propaganda video.

41
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Look at what they rolled out

42
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,979
ahead of the Chinese New Year.

43
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,359
Behold the power of China’s single tank.

44
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,320
The...navy?

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,259
They’re even trying to reuse tanks as boats!

46
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,250
You get the point, they need more money.

47
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,680
Official figures from the past two years

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,090
show the smallest increase in the military
budget

49
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,759
in a decade.

50
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,810
But “Experts say the true figure

51
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,170
is likely much higher than what is officially
reported,

52
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,020
with money for some military projects

53
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,069
included in ostensibly non-military spending.”

54
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,069
What?

55
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,459
These missile launchers are totally for civilian
use.

56
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,140
Now off to Xinjiang in Western China.

57
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,849
It’s home of the much maligned

58
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,170
ethnic Uighur population.

59
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,630
They’ve had to deal with

60
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,250
a massive security crackdown,

61
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,650
surveillance using face recognition technology,

62
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,940
and Minority Report style precog criminal
justice.

63
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,130
But somehow,

64
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,000
these Western news reports keep getting out!

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,120
Those meddling journalists…

66
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,510
Well now, the Chinese regime

67
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,890
is going after the journalists, too.

68
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,000
Authorities have detained the relatives

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,090
of four US-based reporters

70
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,640
with Radio Free Asia

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
who have been covering Xinjiang.

72
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,879
First, Chinese authorities just asked the
relatives

73
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,060
to call those reporters and ask them

74
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,950
to stop reporting on Xinjiang.

75
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,480
But when threatening nicely didn’t work,

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,760
the abductions started.

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,310
One reporter learned that Chinese police

78
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,730
had arrested 20 of the her relatives

79
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,110
because of her reporting.

80
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,319
Another one had relatives taken

81
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,350
to a political reeducation center

82
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,849
called the Loving Kindness School.

83
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:06,849
Don’t worry.

84
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,730
It’s one of China’s top political reeducation
centers—

85
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,560
along with the the Government Loves Everyone
Academy,

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,849
and the CCP Besties 4-Ever Institute.

87
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,810
Of course, since we’re hearing about

88
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,400
how journalists’ relatives are being detained,

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,739
clearly the strategy of intimidating journalists

90
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,890
is not working.

91
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,079
A Chinese man was admitted

92
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,799
to a hospital earlier this week

93
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,239
for a minor stomach ache.

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,340
Even though previously he had

95
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,980
a clean bill of health,

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,859
this turned out to be a much deadlier condition.

97
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,260
He had contracted a case

98
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,140
of what Chinese military doctors call,

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,159
“being a rights lawyer.”

100
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,290
A few hours after entering the hospital,

101
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,099
the condition dramatically worsened

102
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,650
until tragically, he bled to death.

103
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,170
Because of a liver problem.

104
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,920
Yeah...

105
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,719
Some are calling rights lawyer Li Baiguang’s
death

106
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,430
at the No. 81 Military Hospital

107
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,689
a mysterious death.

108
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,689
But Bob Fu,

109
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,000
head of the Chinese Christian rights group,

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,920
ChinaAid, calls it murder.

111
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,150
Li Baiguang defended underground Christians
in China.

112
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,239
They’re the ones who refuse to worship

113
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,819
in state-approved churches

114
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,350
run by the atheist Communist Party.

115
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,300
A Twitter programer who was visiting his family
in China

116
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,810
was invited to tea by the Chinese Public Security
Bureau.

117
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,130
How friendly.

118
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,340
First, they asked him if he did anything

119
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,960
to “harm national interest.”

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,170
And then they asked for Twitter code technology

121
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,319
so they could monitor twitter content.

122
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,930
For national interest.

123
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,710
Now this may surprise you,

124
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,860
but Radio Free Asia suspects the Chinese regime

125
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,370
may be pressuring his family.

126
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,970
But even if the Public Security Bureau

127
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,280
didn’t get the Twitter code they wanted,

128
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,030
at least they have Apple’s Chinese users
data.

129
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,590
Apple has officially put

130
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,880
all their Chinese users’ iCloud data

131
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,169
on servers belonging to the state-run company,

132
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,380
Cloud Big Data.

133
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,510
Apple will also store

134
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,210
Chinese iCloud encryption keys there.

135
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,470
Just to make sure the Chinese regime

136
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,350
has easy access.

137
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,030
“Because of the move,

138
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,710
the Chinese government will be able use

139
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,319
its own legal system to ask Apple

140
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,330
for its users’ iCloud data,

141
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,980
whereas before the government had to

142
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,690
go through the U.S. legal system.”

143
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,690
Now Apple has said

144
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,389
they weren’t happy about it.

145
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,500
But in the end,

146
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,569
what choice did they have

147
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,100
other than to cave in?

148
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,699
I mean, it would be practically unethical

149
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,720
not to seek a share of that sweet,

150
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,910
sweet China market.

151
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,910
And finally,

152
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,700
President Trump has said he will implement

153
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,910
new tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel.

154
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,590
He’s complained frequently about

155
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,210
how US manufacturing gets hurt,

156
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,220
because Chinese companies

157
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,889
get government subsidies

158
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,340
and export their goods

159
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,030
at below market prices.

160
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,800
“So, we’re bringing it back

161
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,430
and we’re going to bring it back relatively
rapidly.

162
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,730
And we’re going to be instituting tariffs.

163
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,240
Next week we’ll be signing.”

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,729
From the initial announcement,

165
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,330
it looks like these tariffs will apply

166
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,550
to all aluminum and steel imports,

167
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,599
not just those from China.

168
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,710
Meanwhile, the Chinese government already

169
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,990
has plans to retaliate.

170
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,050
“Its commerce ministry investigating

171
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,080
imports of US sorghum,

172
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
which is used to feed livestock.

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,660
And officials say China

174
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,879
could further target soybeans.”

175
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,539
So is this the start of a trade war with China?

176
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,870
Well, what China doesn’t realize is that

177
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,229
the US can actually survive just fine

178
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,620
without selling soybeans to China.

179
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,440
They really should put a tariff on iPhones.

180
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,260
So what do you think?

181
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,360
Leave your comments below.

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

183
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,580
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

184
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,700
See you next time.

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Well the Chinese Communist Party

186
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,849
is certainly rotten.

187
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:52,599
But you know what never goes bad?

188
