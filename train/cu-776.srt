1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,380
The Chinese Communist Party

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,140
Controls the coronavirus narrative

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,140
They even control

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:28,750
“The Science” around 

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,750
the world

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,750
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,750
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,000
From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak,
the Chinese Communist Party has been involved

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,430
in a massive cover-up.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,760
The Party silenced doctors who tried to warn
others about the virus.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,550
They lied about human-to-human transmission
of the virus.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,190
They pressured the World Health Organization
to repeat those lies.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,470
That’s why I’ve been calling the coronavirus
the CCP virus.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,400
Because no matter where the virus came from,
the Chinese Communist Party is still responsible

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,220
for the cover-up that led to a global pandemic.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,840
But now that the Wuhan lab-leak theory is
suddenly credible, more media have been doing...actual

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,350
reporting.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,520
Which means they’re almost catching up to
the group of amateur Twitter sleuths who broke

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,960
this story last year.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
So evidence that the CCP virus leaked from
a lab in Wuhan is piling up.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,090
And people are paying attention.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,670
The Chinese Communist Party hates this.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,009
Their response to this has been to repeatedly
imply that the coronavirus actually comes

24
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,719
from the US military biolab at Fort Detrick.

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,149
With headlines like “Who lives a lie gets
challenged by the truth.”

26
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,409
Proving once again the Communist Party lives
in an irony-free zone.

27
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,810
I’ve talked about how the US media outright
dismissed the lab leak hypothesis as a conspiracy

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,679
theory, which made them a mouthpiece for Chinese
communist propaganda.

29
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,299
That’s on my other channel America Uncovered.

30
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,440
But this denial and censorship isn’t just
the media’s fault.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,860
For the last year, we’ve been told to “follow
the science” when it comes to the virus.

32
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,331
But it’s clear now the Chinese regime has
been able to manipulate, co-opt, and censor

33
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:24,340
“the science” from the very beginning.

34
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
Some of it was obvious.

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,720
Like when Chinese police silenced Dr. Li Wenliang
for trying to warn other doctors about the

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,640
CCP virus.

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,430
Another early example: A group of Chinese
researchers shared the genome of the CCP virus

38
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,690
on January 11, 2020.

39
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,730
This was hailed as a sign China was being
more open about the virus outbreak.

40
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,050
It turns out, not so much.

41
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:58,150
The lab that released the genome was shut
down for “rectification” the next day.

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,500
The researchers had already sequenced the
genome on January 5, two days before China’s

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,290
official announcement that the mysterious
pneumonia cases in Wuhan were caused by a

44
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,290
coronavirus.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,100
“The team made the finding public on January
11 after it saw that the authorities had taken

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,430
no obvious action to warn the public about
the coronavirus.”

47
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,400
And then they were closed down.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,010
But months later, the head of that lab, Zhang
Yongzhen, denied that his lab suffered any

49
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,600
prolonged closure.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,070
Was he telling the truth?

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,290
It’s hard to say.

52
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,170
Chinese scientists work under an authoritarian
regime.

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,750
If he’s talking to TIME magazine, Zhang
isn’t going to say, “Yeah the government

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,600
totally closed me down.”

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,560
Even if it did.

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,080
But it turns out, Zhang’s lab was not the
first one to sequence the virus genome.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,790
Several other labs had sequenced it in late
December and early January.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,340
Then they were ordered by health officials
to stop testing and destroy the samples.

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,160
“On Jan. 3, China’s National Health Commission
(NHC), the nation’s top health authority,

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,650
ordered institutions not to publish any information
related to the unknown disease, and ordered

61
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:24,999
labs to transfer any samples they had to designated
testing institutions, or to destroy them.”

62
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:31,770
Even the Wuhan Institute of Virology was ordered
to destroy their samples.

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,520
So given the global gag order, Zhang’s lab
would definitely have been in trouble for

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,610
publishing the genome without official approval.

65
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,840
So the Chinese Communist Party has definitely
censored scientists in China.

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,470
That’s terrible, but not surprising.

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,819
But the Chinese regime has also censored scientists
in the West.

68
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,620
They've done this through manipulating Western
scientific journals to silence any discussion

69
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,710
about the lab leak hypothesis.

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,010
I’ll tell you how after the break.

71
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010
Welcome back.

72
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,379
We’re talking about the CCP virus, so you
probably didn’t see an ad there, did you?

73
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:17,060
One of the main ways the Communist Party spreads
its message is to co-opt outsiders and get

74
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,960
them to repeat the Party line.

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,310
In the case of the CCP virus, one of the loudest
voices has been Dr. Peter Daszak.

76
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,180
Daszak worked directly with the Wuhan Institute
of Virology.

77
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,249
But he organized a letter published in the
Lancet.

78
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,060
That’s a prestigious medical journal.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,000
His letter called the lab leak hypothesis
a conspiracy theory.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,960
Of course, at first people didn’t realize
that Daszak’s non-profit was working with

81
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,870
the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronaviruses,
because Daszak didn’t disclose that giant

82
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,160
conflict of interest.

83
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,779
In fact, he outright lied and said “We declare
no competing interests.”

84
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,220
And then he talked to anyone who would interview
him about how the idea that the CCP virus

85
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,280
could have possibly leaked from a lab was
an absurd and harmful conspiracy theory.

86
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,159
Daszak also traveled to China as part of the
WHO team to investigate the origins of the

87
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,740
coronavirus.

88
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,319
He was the only American allowed on the team.

89
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,090
Sure, he’s worked with the lab that should
be investigated, but that just means he’s

90
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,809
an expert, right?

91
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:34,569
Speaking of conspiracy theories, Daszak even
gave an interview to my favorite Chinese state-run

92
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,949
media, the Global Times.

93
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:43,499
He validated their propaganda that the CCP
virus did not come from China.

94
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:48,800
Last year, after the Trump administration
shut down funding to Daszak’s non-profit,

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,430
Nature magazine even did a sympathetic interview
with Daszak.

96
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,430
Of course, when Daszak was describing the
research they did in Wuhan that the US government

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,749
should definitely be funding, he conveniently
left out the part about how the Wuhan Institute

98
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:11,310
of Virology was doing gain of function research
to make coronaviruses more dangerous to humans.

99
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,710
We know they were doing this based on research
grants Daszak got from the US National Institutes

100
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,050
of Health.

101
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,259
But now that Daszak’s conflicts of interests
have been exposed, he’s left a UN-backed

102
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,750
commission to look into the origins of Covid.

103
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,300
That commission was organized by the Lancet,
the same medical journal that published Daszak’s

104
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,199
letter condemning the lab leak hypothesis,
the one where he falsely declared no competing

105
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,199
interests.

106
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,279
I bet the Lancet is embarrassed now.

107
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,740
They should probably issue a correction on
that letter.

108
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,520
Instead, the Lancet published Daszak’s updated
disclosure statement.

109
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,249
Where he said he never received funding from
the People’s Republic of China.

110
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,900
Ok, that’s *technically* true.

111
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,099
You never directly got money from China.

112
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:11,909
But you did research with a lab that’s directly
funded and managed by the Chinese government.

113
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,419
One that also works with the Chinese military.

114
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,409
And your access to that work depends on the
Chinese Communist Party.

115
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,229
Maybe that’s worth pointing out.

116
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,069
But the Lancet letter wasn’t the only one
that convinced everyone to stop looking at

117
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:28,129
the lab leak hypothesis.

118
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,779
There was also this letter published in Nature
Medicine.

119
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:39,409
It was held up as definitive scientific proof
that the CCP virus came from nature and not

120
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,450
a lab leak.

121
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,760
One of the scientists who wrote that letter
received China’s top science award for foreigners.

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,690
And another is a guest professor at China’s
CDC and a visiting professor at Fudan University.

123
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,250
So those are both big conflicts of interest.

124
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,470
But there’s an even bigger problem with
the Nature Medicine journal—the problem

125
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,380
of where the journal gets its money.

126
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,790
More after the break.

127
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,910
Welcome back.

128
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:18,149
In 2015, Nature Medicine published this research
article on bat coronaviruses.

129
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,450
One of the authors was Dr. Shi Zhengli , who
works on bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute

130
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,510
of Virology.

131
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:32,250
And it involved doing gain of function research
on bat coronaviruses.

132
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,520
Which led to Nature Medicine leaving this
Editor’s Note on the article to “debunk”

133
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,830
the idea of a CCP virus lab leak.

134
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,509
Maybe it’s time to update that editor’s
note.

135
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:51,779
Shi Zhengli also published a paper in Nature
that was the first analysis of the CCP virus.

136
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,570
In that paper, she introduced a virus called
RaTG13, which was the closest relative to

137
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,620
the CCP virus.

138
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,750
She said it was found in nature.

139
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,649
So if the closest relative to the CCP Virus
was found in nature, then *surely* the CCP

140
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,750
virus itself must also have a natural origin,
right?

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,770
But Dr. Shi *hid* the fact that she was the
one who discovered RaTG13, and took it into

142
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,180
her lab, and did experiments on it.

143
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:33,190
And it’s *possible* she used gain of function
research to turn RaTG13 into the CCP Virus.

144
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,759
But it took Nature nine months to even acknowledge
that she was the one who discovered RaTG13.

145
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:46,000
Shi Zhengli has been hiding a lot more stuff
when it comes to the CCP virus.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,550
I don’t have time to get into it all here,
but let me know if you’d like me to do an

147
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,019
episode on it.

148
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:57,269
And Shi isn’t the only Chinese scientist
who used Western journals to dismiss the possibility

149
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,040
of a lab leak.

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,779
Chinese officials claimed the CCP virus outbreak
was from an animal at the Wuhan wet market.

151
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,089
And then, Chinese scientists suddenly started
submitting papers in Western journals pointing

152
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,680
to a similar virus that was in pangolins.

153
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,279
Nature published two of these Chinese papers—and
that made the theory seem credible.

154
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,230
Even though...it turns out, pangolins weren’t
sold at that wet market.

155
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,069
But Nature never pointed out the problems
with the pangolin studies.

156
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:35,699
Here’s where it gets interesting.

157
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,960
Nature has a financial relationship with the
Chinese Communist Party.

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,570
Here’s how it works:

159
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,340
Nature’s parent company is Springer Nature.

160
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,990
It turns out that China is “becoming the
biggest national sponsor of open access journals

161
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,600
published by both Springer Nature and Elsevier
(El-zuh-veer), owner of The Lancet.”

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
Oh the Lancet too?

163
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,410
The one Daszak wrote for.

164
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,089
Good to know.

165
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,690
So what does all this Chinese Communist Party
money go to?

166
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,220
They’re paying these publishing companies
to publish Chinese “scientific” journals

167
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,260
that the Communist Party funded.

168
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,440
Those journals include China Science Materials,
which is edited by the state-run China Academy

169
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,279
of Sciences.

170
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,069
And the Chinese Journal of Catalysis, which
is also run by several Chinese state scientific

171
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,290
bodies.

172
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,520
Springer Nature and Elsevier get millions
of dollars, and China’s scientific journals

173
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,800
seem more prestigious.

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,630
Springer Nature’s sponsorship agreements
alone could be worth 10 million dollars.

175
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,470
That’s 10 million reasons to not publish
papers that challenge the Communist Party’s

176
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,270
coronavirus claims.

177
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,339
And Springer Nature *has* censored articles
in the past.

178
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,870
Back in 2017, at the Chinese Communist Party’s
request, Springer Nature censored hundreds

179
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,259
of journal articles on sensitive topics.

180
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:11,750
Topics that Springer Nature censored included
Taiwan, Tibet, and human rights.

181
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,170
Those articles were censored in China.

182
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,690
But it’s not a leap to think Springer Nature
would be worried about angering the Chinese

183
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:25,410
regime outside China now about the origins
of the CCP Virus—since millions of dollars

184
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,509
may depend on it.

185
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:32,139
So when we in America were told to “follow
the science” over the past year, we were

186
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:39,380
actually following scientists and journals
that have huge conflicts of interest—including

187
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,820
funding from communist China.

188
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,649
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

189
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,699
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

190
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,240
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

191
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,790
Black Label asks, “Given the massive Sinkholes,
the shaking building and the collapse of bridges,

192
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,860
and the recent fear of the Taishan nuclear
plant going up Chernobyl style...would China

193
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,720
fall first from an infrastructure standpoint,
before any military action would happen?

194
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,110
That's a really interesting question Black
Label.

195
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,069
So first of all, considering all the corruption
in construction and manufacturing you just

196
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:24,850
mentioned, you gotta wonder how capable the
Chinese Communst Party’s military actually

197
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,060
is.

198
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,129
But I think you’re right—internal corruption
is a major risk to the Chinese Communist Party.

199
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:35,319
That’s something even former Communist leaders
have talked about.

200
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,259
A lot of construction is also rushed through
to artificially boost GDP numbers.

201
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,790
It’s not tied to any kind of market principles.

202
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,680
On top of that, China is running out of US
dollars.

203
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,600
That will have a major impact on the economy
and any future infrastructure works.

204
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,360
So I think you’re right, war with the Chinese
Communist Party may never happen.

205
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,310
Internal corruption could be the catalyst
that triggers the collapse of the Party.

206
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,160
Thanks for your question and your support
Black Label.

207
