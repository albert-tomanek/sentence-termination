1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,560
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,600
China doesn’t care about your views on race.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,080
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,379
Boy, the whole world is envious

6
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,450
of China and Africa’s good relationship.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,880
At least that’s what my favorite state-run
media

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,110
the Global Times says.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,180
I wonder if they know Africa

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,600
is a continent and not a country?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,810
You see,

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,980
China was a victim of European colonialism
too.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,210
They get it.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,219
That’s why any relationship with China

15
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,649
will be one of win-win cooperation.

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,510
China has been building roads,

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,120
railroads, and ports in Africa.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,309
Why they even built

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,140
the new African Union Building.

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,260
Now some obviously jealous Western powers

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,640
are trying to say,

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,500
“Oh, those infrastructure projects

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,019
are creating huge debt.

24
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,370
Oh, you’re giving the construction jobs

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,879
mostly to Chinese workers

26
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,230
and not to locals.

27
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,850
Oh, you bugged the African Union building

28
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,770
and inserted a backdoor into its computer
network.”

29
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,540
Some have even dared to suggest

30
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,390
that China might be a type of colonial power.

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,990
Look, sure the Chinese regime is stripping

32
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,450
African countries of natural resources.

33
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,219
Sure, these countries are getting

34
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,930
an unfair deal on those construction projects.

35
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,189
Sure, the occasional Chinese company

36
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,530
has been accused of stealing water from locals.

37
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,310
But China will never repeat the kinds of mistakes

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,200
made in the past by people from the West.

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,299
Anyway, here’s some blackface

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,000
from the annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala.

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,760
"Why did you cheat your mother?

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,100
Mum, I don't want to get married so early.

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,560
I want to go to China to study (abroad).

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,760
I want to be like Chinese people,

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,140
roll up your sleeves and get to work

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,420
and gain a thumbs up from the world’s people."

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,640
Ha HA!

48
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,979
Yes, thumbs up from the world’s people.

49
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,390
Now this may be shocking to you,

50
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,969
but the mother in that skit

51
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,640
was actually not African.

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,230
She was a Chinese woman in blackface.

53
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,680
Oh and she was followed around

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,099
by an African man dressed as a giant monkey.

55
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,989
Which is totally normal in Africa.

56
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,010
All this hasn’t been received very well.

57
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,909
That skit was set in Kenya,

58
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,519
and has the actress in blackface

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,290
saying things like, “China has done

60
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,019
so much for Africa.”

61
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,019
And, “I love Chinese people.

62
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,960
I love China.”

63
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,069
Strange that they have to

64
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,069
pay someone to say that.

65
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,460
Now to be fair,

66
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,900
China has a very different history of race
relations

67
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,269
than say, the United States.

68
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,430
But this is not the first time

69
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,790
China has been nailed for being a tad

70
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,319
racially insensitive towards Africans.

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,599
This ad for a Chinese laundry detergent

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,080
shows a black guy taking the tide pod challenge,

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,310
then being shoved into a washing machine,

74
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,830
and emerging as a nice Chinese man.

75
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,360
And one museum featured photos of black people

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,319
alongside the animals they supposedly look
like.

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,550
What makes the CCTV Gala different, though,

78
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,019
is the amount of thought that went into it.

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,290
This is the biggest propaganda showcase

80
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,680
of the year.

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,040
800 million people watch it.

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,909
It’s quite literally the government of China

83
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,620
putting on a show.

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,720
And it goes through countless rounds of vetting

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,739
by Chinese censors.

86
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,879
This didn’t just accidentally happen.

87
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,310
A lot of people had to look at this and say,

88
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,310
“Yup!

89
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,930
This is a good idea.

90
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,150
This will really get a thumbs up

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,310
from the world’s people.”

92
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,540
Meanwhile, yet another person

93
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,610
has fallen victim to the crime

94
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,349
of hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.

95
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,450
This time Chinese model Liu Wen.

96
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,640
Was her sin worse than blackface?

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,060
Oh, way worse.

98
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
On Instagram,

99
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,430
she wished her fans a

100
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,129
“Happy Lunar New Year.”

101
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,640
She was supposed to say,

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,250
“Happy Chinese New Year!”

103
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,010
Even though it’s celebrated throughout Asia

104
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,719
as the Lunar New Year,

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,819
you should only refer to it

106
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,310
as the Chinese New Year!

107
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,120
Some more patriotic Chinese netizens

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,329
freaked out.

109
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,910
One Chinese user wrote on Instagram,

110
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,390
“If you want to become Vietnamese so badly,

111
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,530
get out and don’t come back to China.”

112
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,660
Does that make sense?

113
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,740
Obviously not.

114
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,370
Instagram is banned in China.

115
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,510
How did that person get access?

116
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,600
Anyway, model Liu Wen has now

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,250
corrected her grave mistake

118
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,000
of thinking that not all Asians are Chinese.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,340
So what do you think of the blackface

120
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,870
on the Lunar New Year Gala?

121
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,570
I mean Chinese New Year Gala?

122
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,710
I mean Spring Festival Gala?

123
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,860
Leave your comments below.

124
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,759
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

125
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,009
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

126
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,200
see you next time.

127
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,260
Well the Chinese Communist Party

128
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,590
is certainly rotten.

129
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,270
But you know what never goes bad?

130
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,990
Food from Thrive Life.

131
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,860
Thrive Life sells freeze dried meals

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,440
that stay fresh.

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,620
And if you order through the link

134
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,880
in the description below,

135
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,060
China Uncensored gets a cut.

136
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,390
I wouldn’t ask you to eat their food

137
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,890
if I didn’t also personally love it.

138
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,690
So support your belly and China Uncensored

139
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,980
