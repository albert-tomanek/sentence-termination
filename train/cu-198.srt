00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,460
even a war on pollution can have casualties.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,770
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,840
In 2014, China launched a war against pollution.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,200
But it’s been tough.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Turns out,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,870
it’s much easier to arrest dissidents than
smog.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,060
Which is why Beijing police

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,000
are now being armed with vacuum cleaners.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Not for the smog.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,680
It’s to knock out the dissidents.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,450
Makes it more challenging.

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,160
But in terms of pollution,

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,040
China has been pushing ahead.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,500
The Chinese Communist Party has said

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,510
it wants to be a world leader

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,000
in transitioning out of “dirty energy”

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,780
and “going green”!

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,850
For example,

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,630
as Northern China enters a freezing winter,

22
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,610
the Ministry of Environmental Protection

23
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,820
issued a vaguely worded notice to 28 cities

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,489
to keep air pollution under control

25
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,870
by speeding up the transition

26
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,980
from coal to natural gas.

27
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,289
Local officials began arresting people

28
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,079
for burning coal.

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,729
This propaganda banner literally says,

30
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,340
“Whoever burns coal will be arrested.”

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,080
Ok, that’s a little harsh.

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,320
Maybe they could just put coal

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,160
in your Christmas stocking as a warning.

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,390
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

35
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,150
They don’t have Christmas stockings in China?

36
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,500
Ok, well never mind then.

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,580
Arresting people is obviously the next logical
step.

38
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,960
But anyway, it sounds good—

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,580
stop people from burning that dirty coal.

40
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,580
After all,

41
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,070
we’re talking about pollution that’s so
bad,

42
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,060
a University of Chicago study found

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000
it takes three years off the average person’s
life

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,290
in Northern China.

45
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,350
And in exchange,

46
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,780
Chinese authorities promised they would transition

47
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,380
everyone to natural gas.

48
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,740
Just one small problem:

49
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,180
In a lot of areas,

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,980
authorities didn’t get the pipes set up
in time.

51
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,829
So when people started getting arrested

52
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,560
for using coal,

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,450
they didn’t have any alternative.

54
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,340
Well, except to freeze, I guess.

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,340
And in places where natural gas was available,

56
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,569
massive shortages made prices skyrocket.

57
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,809
According to Tencent,

58
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:14,379
“One senior couple secretly burned coal
for heat,

59
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:16,799
and died of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning

60
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,069
due to poor ventilation.

61
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,340
Even in areas where natural gas

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
and electricity are available,

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,739
low-income families complain

64
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,129
that they are too expensive.”

65
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,689
Stories of people burning sticks

66
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,010
and corncobs to keep warm

67
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,719
have been going viral on China’s internet.

68
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,680
So have photos of children having class

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,560
outside in their coats—

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,580
because at least you can’t be arrested

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,040
for letting the sun keep you warm.

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,669
For now.

73
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,129
As Bloomberg put it,

74
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,840
all this became “another example of how

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,519
China’s bureaucracy can sometimes subordinate

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,340
common sense to centrally mandated goals.”

77
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,169
Mmm, the success of central planning.

78
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,480
Here’s how it works in China:

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,680
the central government issues

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,909
a high-level policy directive,

81
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,639
like reducing the number of coal-burning households

82
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,809
by 1.8 million in Hebei province.

83
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,269
They don’t care how officials in Hebei do
it,

84
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,749
as long as it gets done.

85
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,879
And since whether you meet

86
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,569
the central government’s goals

87
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,950
is tied closely to whether you get promoted,

88
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,049
local officials are motivated to do anything
they can

89
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,000
to meet the numbers.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
As one official put it,

91
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
local officials also don’t want to get blamed

92
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,880
for not meeting the target.

93
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,739
Yes, fear is a powerful motivator.

94
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,239
And sometimes officials get too motivated.

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,250
Like in Hebei,

96
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,069
where they decided to reduce the number of

97
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,329
coal-burning households by 2.3 million

98
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,290
instead of 1.8 million.

99
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,249
Exceeding expectations!

100
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,249
By leaving people with no heat

101
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,059
and triggering a natural gas shortage.

102
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,909
The worst part, though,

103
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,569
is that they made the central government look
bad.

104
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,730
So now the Hebei officials have been trotted
out to,

105
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,159
guess what,

106
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,939
take the blame.

107
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:03,989
What a backfire.

108
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,349
Sadly, that’s the only kind of fire

109
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,840
that won’t keep you warm.

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,489
Let’s just hope it doesn’t also backfire

111
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,540
for Apple CEO Tim cook.

112
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,260
While he was in China this month,

113
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,509
he said, “China’s environmental leadership
is very clear,

114
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,299
and it aligns completely with Apple’s values,”

115
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,760
Sounds like Apple’s values might be a tad
rotten.

116
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,780
Oh, and another thing.

117
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,980
Most of China’s coal pollution doesn’t
even

118
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,470
come from individuals burning coal in their
homes

119
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,040
to keep warm.

120
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,210
It mostly comes from power plants and factories.

121
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,419
And it just so happens that more than 70%
of factories

122
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,070
don’t meet China’s air pollution standards.

123
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,009
But instead of installing better pollution
controls,

124
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:47,169
factories have also been told to reduce

125
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,259
or stop burning coal.

126
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,990
So that also means a lot of factories

127
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,259
have had to shut down or slow production.

128
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,789
This has had a devastating effect on the economy.

129
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,870
And worst of all,

130
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,210
the shutdown of some chemical factories

131
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,009
means they don’t have what they need

132
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,319
to make Spandex.

133
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,620
One industry executive even warned,

134
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,380
“Spandex will be tight.”

135
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,220
I see what you did there.

136
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,319
How could there be such a big screw up?

137
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,449
Well, in addition to the inefficiency

138
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,250
of top-down directives,

139
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,210
part of the reasons is that estimates

140
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,650
for how much natural gas was needed

141
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,189
were way off.

142
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,300
That’s because the Chinese regime

143
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,889
routinely lies about GDP figures.

144
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,509
There was, “a slump in growth from 2012–2016

145
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,199
that went unrecognized in official GDP statistics

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,889
and may have contributed to planners’

147
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,860
miscalculation of how much coal

148
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,889
would need to be substituted by gas.”

149
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,240
Ok, so maybe flat out lying about your GDP

150
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,789
has real-world consequences.

151
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,669
Now not to worry.

152
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,419
The Chinese Communist Party has decided

153
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,360
to show its benevolence,

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,110
and is no longer requiring people

155
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,389
to freeze to death to meet pollution standards.

156
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,849
In a “double urgent” letter,

157
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,889
“the Ministry of Environmental Protection
told authorities

158
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,110
in 28 cities to relax the coal ban at places.”

159
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,169
It reminded officials that they should

160
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,939
“continue to ensure that the number one
principle

161
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,189
should be keeping people warm in winter.”

162
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,669
An important clarification.

163
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,800
Unfortunately, there’s no word yet

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
on whether spandex production

165
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,919
has been restored

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,819
So what do you think of the ban,

167
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,680
and then, un-ban of coal?
