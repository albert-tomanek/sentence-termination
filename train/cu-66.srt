1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Massive protests in Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,380
may have saved Taiwan.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,840
from a Chinese military invasion,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,240
at least for now...

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,150
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,420
I'm Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,670
Joining me again is Ian Easton,

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,850
Senior Director of Project 2049 Institute

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,279
and an expert on Taiwan and Asia security
issues.

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,030
Thanks for joining me again.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,030
Chris.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,030
It's a great pleasure.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,030
Thanks for having me back.

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,840
Well, so the first time I had you on back
in 2018

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,100
we talked about China's 2020 plan

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,870
to be ready to invade Taiwan

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,620
and now it's a few weeks until 2020.

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,530
Is China still going ahead with that

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,980
or do they need a 2021 plan?

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
That's a very good question.

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,730
So, I've been thinking about this issue,

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,730
and I checked,

23
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,260
and the 13th five-year plan,

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,760
which they're on now,

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,109
doesn't actually end until the end of 2020.

26
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,329
Oh, why didn't you tell me that last time?

27
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,890
Well, I didn't know.

28
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,890
Oh.

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,979
But having said that, I'm still skeptical

30
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,479
that the PLA is going to be ready in time.

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,390
I think that if Xi Jinping were to order the
PLA

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,659
to invade Taiwan today or even next year,

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,990
there's a high probability of failure on his
part.

34
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,620
I think he would lose.

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,070
The question is, does he know that?

36
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,470
I mean, he's a dictator,

37
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,640
so are his generals going to tell him the
truth

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
if he decides now's the time?

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,390
Well, so with the trade war

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,690
and the slowing economy

41
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,120
and the situation in Hong Kong,

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,010
do you think with all of,

43
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,970
with China distracted by all of that,

44
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,540
that might let Taiwan off the hook?

45
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,170
I think in the near term it probably will.

46
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,250
Most countries, even countries

47
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,800
as powerful as China has become,

48
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,380
prefer to deal with one crisis at a time

49
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,360
or to at least minimize the number of crises

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
they have to deal with at a time.

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,630
And so I would expect that as long as Hong
Kong

52
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,250
is very problematic right now

53
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,890
and as long as the United States

54
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,850
continues to show that it's truly serious

55
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,050
about strategic competition with China,

56
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,310
as we've seen with the trade war

57
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,840
and with other more competitive posturing
that

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,040
the Trump administration has taken,

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,030
I think it's unlikely that China

60
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,489
is going to attempt the invasion of Taiwan

61
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,080
in the near future.

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,060
Although, that's speculative.

63
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,950
Nobody knows the future.

64
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,510
And certainly my beliefs

65
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,270
could be falsified by events,

66
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,890
but I would not expect that to happen

67
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,970
in the very near future.

68
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,670
It's more of a longer term threat.

69
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,670
Okay.

70
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,670
So in the longterm,

71
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,900
is Taiwan still a flash point?

72
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,250
Oh, absolutely.

73
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,740
I think Taiwan is arguably

74
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,340
the most dangerous flash point on the planet,

75
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,780
and it's going to become more dangerous

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,180
over time for a variety of reasons.

77
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,200
Such as?

78
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,540
So, China is growing its military power

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,790
and as China increases its military power

80
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,280
and as Taiwan's own military defensive power

81
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,740
and the United States' power in the region,

82
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,480
in a comparative sense, starts to diminish
over time,

83
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,990
that is going to make Taiwan a much more

84
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,690
attractive target for CCP expansionism.

85
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,380
Well, I know lately there's been

86
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,430
a lot of traffic in the Taiwan Strait.

87
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,240
Why is it so popular?

88
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,090
You mean traffic in terms of the Chinese military,

89
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,090
or the U.S. Navy?

90
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,150
There's the U.S. Navy,

91
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,660
there's the Chinese Navy.

92
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,230
Yeah, absolutely.

93
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,410
So a few weeks ago,

94
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,209
Taiwan's minister of national defense,

95
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,840
Yen Teh-fa, testified before Thailand's,

96
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,989
Taiwan's parliament that they had tracked
over 2,000 Chinese flights in the Taiwan Strait

97
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,970
area over the past 12 months.

98
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
Wow.

99
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,290
And that they expected that trend to continue

100
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,980
or possibly increase.

101
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,920
And that included Chinese bombers that

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,630
are strictly in Taiwan,

103
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,010
Chinese intelligence aircraft,

104
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,010
Chinese fighter planes,

105
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,910
and also a lot of drones.

106
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,520
And so, what we're likely to see in the coming
months

107
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
is China ramping up its air and Naval activity

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,930
around Taiwan in order to exhaust Taiwan's
military.

109
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,810
So for every Taiwanese, excuse me,

110
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,930
for every Chinese sortie around Taiwan,

111
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,020
the Taiwanese Air Force has to respond.

112
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,300
They have to scramble their fighter aircraft

113
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,840
to go respond to it.

114
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,842
When you see a blip on your radar screen coming
at you,

115
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:35,889
you can't identify from the radar screen itself

116
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,640
what that is.

117
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,180
And so that's why Taiwan has to

118
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,190
scramble fighter aircraft

119
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,320
so they can actually get visual identification

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,390
to see if it's a drone or a bomber or something
else.

121
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,340
Well, every time they do that,

122
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,990
that disrupts their pilot training.

123
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,630
It's a lot of resources that are expanding

124
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,070
in terms of fuel and manpower,

125
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,669
and over time that has the potential

126
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,720
to significantly weaken Taiwan's air force.

127
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
And their Navy as well,

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,030
to the extent that they're responding

129
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,220
to all the Chinese Naval activity around Taiwan.

130
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,720
They've done the same to Japan,

131
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,610
around the Senkaku Islands.

132
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,750
They've done the same to countries

133
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,720
in the South China sea.

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,750
Some people call it gray zone operations,

135
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,930
and we can certainly expect

136
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,620
that they're going to do that,

137
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,550
well they're already doing that to Taiwan.

138
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,250
Gray zone meaning...?

139
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,150
Meaning it's hostile,

140
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,450
but nobody's getting shot.

141
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,450
Okay.

142
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,450
So non-kinetic.

143
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,450
So it's pushing to the brink of war, but not-

144
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,750
You're pushing it to the brink of war

145
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,550
in a very calculated fashion,

146
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,970
but not going over the break.

147
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,190
Well, so what about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan

148
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,810
because there's been some record-breaking

149
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,160
numbers this past year.

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,419
Yeah, so the Trump administration

151
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,139
has responded to some of the Chinese coercion

152
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,050
against Taiwan with arms sales.

153
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,870
So we've notified to Congress

154
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,830
the sale of new tanks to Taiwan.

155
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,110
I think that's 108 new Abrams main battle
tanks,

156
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,110
which are the most advanced tank on the market.

157
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,450
And then also new F-16 fighter jets,

158
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,450
66 of them,

159
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,260
which is enough for about three squadrons.

160
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,570
And that's a very significant announcement

161
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,300
because the United States since the 1990's,

162
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
as a matter of policy,

163
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,410
has not sold Taiwan new fighter jets.

164
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,870
So there was an announcement of a sale in
1992

165
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,370
which was fulfilled around 1997/98,

166
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,320
but since then there've been no new fighter
jets

167
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,080
sold to Taiwan because fighter aircraft

168
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,530
are considered a strategic asset.

169
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,320
And so this was something that

170
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,000
the Bush administrationshied away from.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,330
The Obama administration shied away from it.

172
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,330
And now this,

173
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,729
the Trump administration has taken sort of
a new tack

174
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,960
and has decided no,

175
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,100
Taiwan really needs those fighter jets.

176
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,340
So that's one of several things administration

177
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,980
has done to try to shore up Taiwan's defensive
position.

178
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,590
But overall, it's a really challenging situation

179
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,280
that Taiwan faces and there's no amount of
arms sales

180
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
that the U.S. can provide.

181
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,389
I mean, no matter how much Taiwan spends on
its defense,

182
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,389
it'll never keep up with the threat that they
face.

183
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,310
Well, what other kind of support

184
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,940
is the U.S. giving to Taiwan?

185
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,030
How is it doing?

186
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,810
Well, there's a range of things

187
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,889
that the United States government

188
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,669
has started to do in terms of sending

189
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:31,710
high level officials to Taiwan.

190
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,919
So for example, the State Department

191
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,280
has been very good about sending

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Deputy Assistant Secretaries of State to Taiwan,

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,640
in some cases very publicly,

194
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,090
and they participate in open forum.

195
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,370
They give public speeches,

196
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,560
they meet with the President of Taiwan

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,250
and they do so in an unabashed way.

198
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,040
We've also recently seen the Pentagon do the
same thing.

199
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,620
They sent an official of the same rank.

200
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,440
It's a civilian equivalent to a two-star,

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,370
maybe three-star General,

202
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,310
who just went to Taiwan for the first time

203
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,470
for private meetings there on defense issues.

204
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,440
These type of moves may seem,

205
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,290
they may seem small,

206
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,300
but when you compare them to where we

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,910
were just two or three years ago,

208
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,910
that was almost unthinkable.

209
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,590
So these are things previous administrations
have not-

210
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,490
Previous administrations never even

211
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,539
seriously considered doing anything like that.

212
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,710
They were terrified of what Beijing's reaction
might be.

213
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,659
And they allowed themselves to,

214
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,440
I guess, be intimidated.

215
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,979
And so they would not send any officials

216
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,599
over the rank of a Colonel to Taiwan.

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,440
So sending a two-star General equivalent

218
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,420
is pretty significant and the United States
has also

219
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,710
sent actual uniform military officers to Taiwan.

220
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,640
And we've started to do regular patrols

221
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,920
of the Taiwan Strait

222
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,850
and to make that public as well.

223
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,529
And so there are a number of steps

224
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,830
that the government has taken to try to support
Taiwan,

225
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,399
because again, Taiwan by itself is in a very,

226
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,399
very difficult situation.

227
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
There's no way they can keep a favorable military

228
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,140
or political balance across the Taiwan Strait.

229
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,930
And so, if you asked me what kind of grade

230
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,000
the Trump administration deserves,

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,050
is something we've talked about in the past,

232
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,300
I would say that compared to the Obama administration

233
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,830
or the Bush administration before it,

234
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,690
or the Clinton administration before it,

235
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,990
the Trump administration probably deserves
an A plus,

236
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,680
in terms of support for Taiwan.

237
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,830
But there's another way to look at it.

238
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,780
Is it enough?

239
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,970
Is the Trump administration keeping up

240
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,380
with the pace of the threat against Taiwan?

241
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,360
Is it keeping up with the changing facts on
the ground

242
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,080
and there I think the administration

243
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,130
would have to deserve a much lower grade

244
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,130
because it is very,

245
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,120
very difficult to keep up with all the things

246
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,050
that China is doing that are directed at Taiwan,

247
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,840
and by extension,

248
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,899
the United States as well.

249
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,480
So what do you think the U.S.

250
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,670
could be doing to earn a solid A,

251
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
at least an A?

252
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,880
Well, it would be difficult.

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,850
I think there's a lot of inertia

254
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,480
that builds up after 40 years of executing

255
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,870
a certain policy.

256
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,050
Its policies not something,

257
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,490
as I understand it from the outside

258
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,340
as just as a researcher,

259
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,790
it's not something that you can turn on a
dime.

260
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,250
And so for 40 years our policy

261
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,220
has been to keep Taiwan at a distance and
to,

262
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,050
in many ways,

263
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,269
make our Taiwan policy through Beijing

264
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,019
to constantly be calculating

265
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,420
if I do this with Taiwan,

266
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,360
what will that mean for U.S. China relations?

267
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,130
What will Beijing's reaction be?

268
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,910
There's still a lot of that mentality, I think,

269
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,850
in many places across the bureaucracy.

270
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,310
But it is changing.

271
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,800
And so if we fast forward to the future to
2025 or 2030,

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,930
what we might expect to see would be not only

273
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,830
U.S. patrols and the Taiwan Strait

274
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,230
but regular U.S. ship visits to Taiwan

275
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,029
and to have ships in Taiwanese ports,

276
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,940
to have troops in Taiwan,

277
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,779
perhaps a few thousand troops on a rotational
basis,

278
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,110
to have military exercises with the Taiwanese
military,

279
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,880
both at the training ranges in Taiwan

280
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,790
and the United States to see regular exchanges

281
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,790
of high level visitors from the United States
to Taiwan,

282
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,630
all the way up to the four-star level

283
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,400
and their civilian equivalents,

284
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,800
and to be moving towards a much more

285
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,460
normalized diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.

286
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,890
I think absent that,

287
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,640
the probability of a major,

288
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,700
very dangerous crises or even a war

289
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,940
across the Taiwan Strait

290
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,270
is very high over the next 10 years.

291
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,720
So what was the concern people had

292
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,000
about what China would do to the U.S.

293
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,750
or Taiwan if the U.S. shows more support?

294
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,450
You know, that's one of the things

295
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,970
that that's funny about fear

296
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,390
is sometimes people are the most afraid of
the unknown.

297
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,220
And in many cases people didn't know.

298
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,561
You know, if you're a diplomat

299
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,339
at the state department and your boss asks
you,

300
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,960
what can I expect from China?

301
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,450
If I go visit Taiwan for example,

302
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,820
or if I write this letter in support

303
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,570
of something Taiwan is doing,

304
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,860
or if I say something at the United Nations

305
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,310
or something of that nature,

306
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,820
in many cases a diplomat couldn't tell you.

307
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,500
They wouldn't know, but there was a fear of,

308
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,140
well they could do this,

309
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
they could do that,

310
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
they could do the other thing,

311
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,459
and none of it would be particularly pleasant.

312
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,910
In many cases it would be as simple

313
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,779
as an angry phone call and over time,

314
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,180
a démarche or an angry letter

315
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,100
from the PRC Embassy here in Washington.

316
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,290
And over time, that seemed to,

317
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,149
at least in some cases,

318
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:20,200
have a certain way of almost conditioning
people

319
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,120
in the U.S. government to anticipate

320
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,480
in advance what the Chinese Communist Party

321
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,920
wanted and then to give it to them,

322
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,370
or conversely to anticipate

323
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,329
what they didn't want and then to avoid that.

324
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,140
It's hard to imagine that the U.S. government

325
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,130
can be turned by an angry letter from Beijing.

326
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,959
Not one, but if you imagine

327
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,820
hundreds of thousands of them

328
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,260
over a 40 year relationship

329
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,209
combined with meetings that are canceled

330
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,660
combined with getting the cold shoulder at
a summit.

331
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,670
All these things have an effect.

332
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,070
It also has an effect when you have

333
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,260
so many former U.S. government officials

334
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,490
making a lot of money in China or in Hong
Kong

335
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,750
through their business connections

336
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,470
with the Chinese Communist Party.

337
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,920
That also has obviously an effect as well.

338
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,040
So what has the Chinese reaction been

339
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,930
to this higher level of U.S. support for Taiwan?

340
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,650
Chris, that is a really, really good question.

341
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,300
In many ways, their reaction has not been
nearly

342
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,810
as terrifying as I think

343
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,700
what many people argued it would be.

344
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Certainly this was something

345
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,850
people worried a lot about,

346
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,920
what would their reaction be?

347
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
And I think those that worried

348
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,600
a lot of probably been a little disappointed

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,529
or maybe now are relieved to see

350
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,980
that the United States can do much more

351
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,240
in support of Taiwan and not set off

352
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,740
a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait.

353
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,610
How do you think the protests in Hong Kong

354
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,470
have impacted Taiwan?

355
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, I think they've served as a wake up

356
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,990
call for many people in Taiwan.

357
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,170
For the past 20 years,

358
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,010
those in Taiwan that favored

359
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,600
a closer relationship with Beijing,

360
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,900
argued that Hong Kong was a success story.

361
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,610
That actually Hong Kong showed

362
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,420
that you could be annexed

363
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,529
by the Chinese Communist Party

364
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,680
the way Hong Kong was back in '97

365
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,620
and the results would not be so bad.

366
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,720
And anybody who had visited Hong Kong before
this year,

367
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,670
certainly before 2014,

368
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,300
would say this is a very pleasant city-state.

369
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,470
Very well run, very wealthy

370
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,139
and a lot of great things going for it.

371
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,370
And so there were those in Taiwan who said,

372
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,860
Hey, maybe one country,

373
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,240
two systems is not so bad.

374
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,430
Maybe that could work for us too.

375
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,110
Certainly that's what the Chinese Communist
Party

376
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,240
wanted to promote,

377
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,690
and it's something they did promote

378
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,480
very heavily across the Taiwan Strait.

379
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,760
Sort of like if the U.S.

380
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,459
isn't giving us much support

381
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,199
and the alternative is war invasion from China,

382
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,529
why not do this seemingly better alternative

383
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,760
of one country, two system?

384
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Exactly.

385
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,860
The sense I think for some politicians in
Taiwan

386
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,519
was that the United States had abandoned them
in 1979

387
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,440
when we switched diplomatic relations.

388
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,410
And what would the PRC and not the ROC,

389
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,160
the Republic of China,

390
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,949
because previously before 1979 Taiwan

391
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,779
was an ally of the United States.

392
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,779
We had diplomatic relations,

393
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,560
we had an embassy in Taipei,

394
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,589
we had troops in Taiwan,

395
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,560
we guarantee Taiwan's security.

396
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
After that,

397
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,910
there was a deep sense of betrayal,

398
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,290
and there were those that said,

399
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,529
well, the international community

400
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,280
no longer recognizes us as a real country.

401
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,330
The United States is keeping us at a distance.

402
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,089
China's threatening us with war

403
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:00,480
if we go fully independent.

404
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
And so we have no alternative other

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,079
than to do a lot of business with China,

406
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,870
and ultimately maybe the best deal

407
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,630
we could get would be a Hong Kong

408
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,139
plus maybe something even better

409
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,230
than what Hong Kong had.

410
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,362
And so there was a number of people in Taiwan

411
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:15,470
that held this view.

412
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,900
I think it was a relatively small number.

413
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,559
I think it was a minority of people,

414
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,779
perhaps a small minority,

415
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:27,409
but that group has really diminished in size

416
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:29,299
over the past six months,

417
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,460
because if people around the world

418
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,970
can now see that the Chinese Communist Party

419
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,899
doesn't keep its promises,

420
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:44,299
and we're all being exposed to image after
image

421
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,169
of extreme police brutality

422
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,479
and unprofessional behavior

423
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:51,850
and a lot of report after report,

424
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,549
including reports from China Uncensored,

425
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:59,770
have shown that Hong Kong is not a model

426
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,520
that anybody else in their right mind

427
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,740
would want to follow.

428
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,929
And so I think it really has served

429
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,350
as a wake up call for Taiwan

430
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,409
and I think it's probably influencing

431
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:11,970
the current presidential elections as well.

432
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,620
Any predictions for the 2020 election in Taiwan?

433
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,809
Well, Taiwan is going to have

434
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,759
it's next presidential elections

435
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,179
on January 11th of 2020,

436
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,549
which is coming up fast,

437
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:32,539
and currently President Tsai Ing-wen of the
DPP

438
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,029
appears to have a significant advantage

439
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:41,370
over Han Kuo-yu, her KMT opponent,

440
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,139
probably in part because she has taken

441
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:48,309
a much stronger position standing up

442
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,890
for Taiwanese sovereignty

443
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,210
and standing up for things like democracy

444
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,909
and support of the protesters in Hong Kong.

445
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:02,159
Whereas the other political party

446
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,139
seems to have more mixed messages on that.

447
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,840
And so I think this is something that is,

448
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,859
has spoken to a fair number of people in Taiwan,

449
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,499
although polls can be misleading

450
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,980
and certainly that's what the polls would
say today.

451
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,619
I think she's up about 30 points over her
opposition,

452
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,480
but polls can be misleading

453
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,950
and you never know what ultimately will happen
here

454
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,000
in a few weeks when people in Taiwan go to
the polls.

455
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
Well thank you so much for joining me.

456
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,149
We'll have to check in again in 2021

457
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,940
to see about the 2020 plan.

458
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,960
Sounds good.

459
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,860
Thanks for having me, Chris.
