00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,280
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,870
Pokémon Go!

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,610
With Chinese characteristics.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,440
Hi, welcome to 
China Uncensored, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,160
I want to be the very best!

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,720
Or at least a cheap knockoff of the very best.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,759
That’s why one of my favorite things to
do in China

8
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:24,550
is play with my Robert Cop action figure

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,890
at my favorite eating establishment, McDnoalds.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,109
It seems like China may have learned a thing
or two from Pokémon.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,859
“Ditto, the transform Pokémon.

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:40,299
Ditto has the ability to reconstruct its entire
cellular structure

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,180
into whatever it sees.”

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,200
It’s just too bad that you can’t play
Pokémon Go in China.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
People in China love Pokémon.

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,660
Why, just look at these Pokémon statues at
an anime festival in Wenzhou!

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,269
You have Ash, Brock, Misty, and

18
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,519
OH WHAT IS THAT?!!

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,050
Looks like they gave this Creep-a-chu teeth.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,730
So with such a huge potential market,

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,370
why aren’t we seeing a Pokémon Go “Red”
version?

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,540
Well, like Snapchat, time travel, and seductively
eating bananas,

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,310
Pokémon Go is banned in China.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,390
Why? Isn’t it obvious?!

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,220
Because it’s a secret plot by Google and
the Japanese

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,170
to discover the location of Chinese military
bases!

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,100
At least, that’s an actual conspiracy theory.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,340
Nevertheless, a minor inconvenience like the
game being banned

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,360
hasn’t stopped people in China from figuring
out

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,580
how to play Pokémon Go anyway.

31
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,730
But believe me,

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,040
it’s harder than evolving a Magikarp.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,510
You can’t get it from Chinese app stores.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,950
So people have been buying IDs for Apple’s
Australia-based app store.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,510
That can cost between 13 cents to 3 dollars.

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,520
Then you need to figure out how to get a Google
account

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,970
since Google is also banned in China.

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,230
Okay, use a VPN; no problem.

39
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,860
Now you can open the game and see this.

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,410
There are no Pokémon in China.

41
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,930
So you then you need to yet another app

42
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,830
that can mess with your GPS and put you in,
say, Los Angeles.

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,270
Now you can finally play…

44
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,170
using a Los Angeles Map.

45
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,050
Assuming these hacks haven’t filled up your
phone with malware.

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,760
Or if you don’t want to go through all that
effort,

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
there is another option.

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,540
Simply play the knock off version of Pokémon
Go!

49
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,780
This is City Elves Go.

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,650
Here’s the professor telling you to go out
in the world

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,819
and catch these cute little monsters for research!

52
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,500
Just like Pokémon Go.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,740
Only “research” in this knockoff Chinese
world

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,720
means beating the City Elves to death...

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,990
like some kind of sick crossover between

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,069
Jane Goodall and Beyond Thunderdome.

57
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:00,540
The City Elves professor gives you the choice
of a fire, water, or earth based monster.

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,010
Sound familiar?

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,640
But unlike Pokémon Go,

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,390
you don’t have to walk around to find Pokémon,

61
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,100
or elves, or whatever.

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,420
City Elves Go does away with that lame old
augmented reality thing,

63
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,920
because that’s not what you’re playing
for, right?

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
You sit at home and watch your monsters battle
others.

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,180
Seriously, you just sit and watch

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,459
because you have no control whatsoever over
this battle.

67
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,040
But at least while you’re watching your
knockoff Pokémon battle,

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,990
you can enjoy product placement from knockoff
7-Eleven.

69
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,780
Which is an actual store in China.

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,580
I just don’t know what’s real anymore.

71
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,190
And the most shocking thing of all

72
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,819
is that people are so desperate to play something
just like Pokémon Go

73
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,590
that City Elves Go is now the number one downloaded
app in China.

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,650
So what do you think of China’s Pokémon
Go knockoff?

75
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,020
And where the heck can I find some better
Pokémon?

76
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,989
Seriously, New York is full of rats and pigeons.

77
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,520
And New Jersey is mostly bats.

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Leave your comments below.

79
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,930
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

80
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,500
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.
See you next time.
