1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,870
China claims it’s eliminated poverty?

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,459
But is that really true? 

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:10,890
Or is it just an excuse for propaganda?

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,699
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,530
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,930
Good news everyone!

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,110
The Chinese Communist Party has defeated poverty.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,140
President Xi Jinping has declared a complete
victory over extreme poverty on Thursday at

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,390
a national conference in Beijing.\h

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,699
Now you might be wondering, did the Communist
Party really achieve a complete victory over

11
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,260
extreme poverty?

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,780
And the answer is, of course they did!

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,530
This is the country that meets every one of
their yearly GDP growth targets, no matter

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,569
how much they have to fudge the numbers.

15
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:57,449
And so the Chinese Communist Party has achieved
complete victory over extreme poverty, by

16
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,039
inventing their own definition of extreme
poverty.\h

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,230
I’ll explain more in a bit.\h

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,970
But don’t focus too much on that part.

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,120
The important thing is that China has lifted
people out of poverty.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,439
During his speech, President Xi highlighted
some of the achievements in this area since

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,250
the country’s Reform and Opening Up began
more than 40 years ago.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,119
He said that during this time China has lifted
more than three quarters of a billion out

23
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,119
of poverty.

24
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,170
This includes about 100 million people since
2012.\h

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,659
We’ve talked before about how the Chinese
Communist Party uses the phrase “lifted

26
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,570
millions out of poverty” as propaganda.

27
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,850
They want you to think of the Communist Party
as a giant benevolent hand, gently lifting

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,670
hundreds of millions of people from poverty.\h

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,270
I talked about why that is essentially a lie
in this episode.

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,719
Basically, the Communist Party was responsible
for putting a lot of people in poverty in

31
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,810
the first place, and it was really the Chinese
people who lifted themselves out of poverty

32
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,069
once the Party loosened their complete control
over the economy.

33
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,500
But as this NPR article points out, Chinese
propaganda outlets don’t use the phrase

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,860
“lifted out of poverty” in Chinese like
they do in English.

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,160
“While China's largest state-run news organizations
routinely boast about China lifting its people

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,560
out of poverty in their English-language editions,
these same news organizations avoid the term

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,500
in their native language.”

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,630
So “lifting people out of poverty” is
a phrase that’s almost exclusively used

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,330
to trick gullible foreigners.

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,610
Just like “I’m an art student, come see
my gallery.”

41
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,730
Or “Be a man, eat this scorpion on a stick.”

42
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,330
Mmmm.

43
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,940
Crunchy.

44
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,400
And very manly.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,170
And now the Communist Party is pushing truly
over-the-top propaganda, like by declaring

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,310
that “The problem of absolute poverty that
has plagued us for thousands of years has

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,900
come to an end.”

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,290
But many Western media outlets are actually
skeptical for once.

49
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,930
The Washington Post points out that “Neither
Xi nor state media explained how the figures

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,970
were calculated and what threshold was used,
prompting questions about the metrics.”

51
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:28,430
The Chinese regime has previously defined
extreme poverty as those living below $2.30

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,430
a day.

53
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,300
But the BBC points out that the World Bank
counts China as an upper-middle-income country.

54
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,230
And according to the World Bank, that means
the poverty line should be more than double

55
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,970
that at $5.50 a day.

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,300
Meanwhile AFP tried to talk to some of the
villagers who were affected by the poverty

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,040
alleviation drive, and got followed around
by authorities.

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,380
And at one interview, Chinese police showed
up to “observe.”

59
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,590
So clearly everything is great.\h

60
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,210
Chinese leader Xi Jinping first announced
this poverty alleviation campaign back in

61
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,710
2015, with a goal of eradicating extreme poverty
by 2020.

62
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:17,440
Which of course meant that the Party was definitely
going to eradicate extreme poverty by 2020.\h

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,880
Even if they had to do it by literally erasing
extreme poverty from the dictionary.\h

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
The poverty alleviation campaign is an example
of how the Chinese Communist Party governs

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
through mass political campaigns.\h

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,450
This one isn’t as destructive of a mass
campaign as the Cultural Revolution.

67
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,350
And it’s not as funny as Xi Jinping’s
Toilet Revolution.

68
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,970
But whenever the Party launches one of these
campaigns, everyone has to get on board.

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,970
And I mean EVERYONE—from the central government
down to local governments, the propaganda

70
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:58,010
organs, the education system, even supposedly
private Chinese companies like Alibaba.

71
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,970
According to official figures, the Communist
Party has spent almost 250 billion dollars

72
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,880
on this poverty alleviation campaign.

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,180
So did it work?

74
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,610
I’ll tell you more after the break.

75
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,510
Welcome back.

76
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,380
Has the Chinese Communist Party’s massive
and very expensive poverty alleviation campaign

77
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,050
actually worked?

78
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,700
Well, it’s hard to tell because all of the
information we get about this is from the

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,740
Chinese regime.

80
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,710
It’s like trying to figure out how many
people in China actually got the coronavirus.

81
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,720
You know the number the authorities are giving
you isn’t real, but there’s no way to

82
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,930
figure out the true number.\h\h

83
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,200
There’s no denying that poverty alleviation
has helped people.

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Foreign Affairs looked at one village where
the local government gave grants and loans

85
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,389
to villagers to build new houses.

86
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,650
And families also got money from the government
to raise their income to the poverty line.

87
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,310
And as part of the massive propaganda campaign,
Chinese state-run media have heavily featured

88
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,350
personal stories of individuals who have benefited
from poverty alleviation.

89
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,520
One example is a farmer named Dong Heqin,
who spent all of his life savings caring for

90
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,220
his sick son.

91
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:24,630
“In 2015, directed by local officials charged
with anti-poverty work, Dong began planting

92
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,760
chili peppers on his land.

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,100
He now earns more than...93,000 dollars from
his crop annually.”

94
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,310
As the China Media Project points out, Dong
has been featured in state-run media as a

95
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,550
poverty alleviation success story since 2018.\h

96
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,880
A typical example is this video from last
year, that shows Dong studiously flipping

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,389
through state-run newspapers, harvesting his
peppers inside a giant greenhouse, and even

98
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:03,610
pointing to a propaganda billboard featuring
his own story he keeps inside his greenhouse

99
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,890
for some reason.

100
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:14,860
But after Dong hit the spotlight, some Chinese
netizens pointed out some holes in his story.

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,460
In a now-deleted WeChat article, a netizen
brought up some questions, like, how did Dong

102
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,560
get almost 50 times the average amount of
land that Chinese farmers have?\h

103
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,810
How did he get nearly 400 thousand dollars
to build greenhouses on all of his land?

104
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,990
And is he really making as much money from
his crops as he’s claiming?

105
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,900
Considering how much land he has and how many
peppers he could grow, “Dong could expect,

106
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,830
at the high end, an annual turnover of about
250,000 yuan.

107
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,830
This is less than 40 percent of what Dong
has claimed in report after report.”

108
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,700
So even these heartwarming poverty alleviation
stories aren’t what they seem.\h

109
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,250
And there’s a darker side to the poverty
alleviation campaign, too.

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:11,720
That’s when the Party decides to help you,
whether you want it to or not.

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,340
Like when local authorities force villagers
out of their ancestral homes, and into apartment

112
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,520
buildings.

113
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,330
In some cases villagers have ended up effectively
homeless.

114
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,340
There are also of course huge issues with
corruption.

115
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:35,360
According to official statistics, from 2016
to 2018 there were 200,000 cases of poverty

116
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,249
alleviation related corruption.

117
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,990
Mostly from people embezzling funds.

118
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,000
And then there’s how the poverty alleviation
campaign has affected China’s ethnic minorities.

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,519
The Communist Party loves to trot out their
happy ethnic minorities for propaganda.

120
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,619
Like celebrating poverty alleviation by having
them sing about how without the Chinese Communist

121
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,499
Party there would be no new China.

122
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,800
Or boasting about how poverty is being eliminated
in Tibet.

123
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
And Xinjiang.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,980
You can’t be a poor person if you’re in
a concentration camp.

125
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,410
I mean, you can still be poor—but they don’t
consider you a person.

126
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,649
The truth is that the Party is destroying
minorities’ way of life by uprooting entire

127
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,769
villages.

128
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,639
And in regions like Tibet and Xinjiang, it’s
even worse.\h

129
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,290
Poverty alleviation is one of the excuses
the Party uses for sending Uyghurs across

130
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,930
China as forced slave labor.

131
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:43,100
And in Tibet, poverty alleviation programs
are actually impoverishing Tibetan nomads.

132
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,980
As well as being a great excuse for getting
Party members to stay in Tibetans’ homes

133
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,629
for weeks to monitor and control their thoughts
and activities.

134
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,240
But nevermind all that.

135
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,850
Because what’s really important about this
poverty alleviation campaign is what’s in

136
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,100
it for the Chinese Communist Party.\h

137
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,420
And I’ll get to that after the break.

138
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
Welcome back.

139
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,509
Like I said earlier, the Party’s propaganda
machine has been in overdrive.

140
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:19,160
They’re even making books and tv shows about
poverty alleviation.\h

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,699
And that’s because this is a huge win.

142
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:27,709
Especially for Xi Jinping, who has positioned
this as his own personal campaign.

143
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:33,220
Yes, Xi is leading China to zero poverty.

144
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,389
Party mouthpiece People’s Daily is even
running a series called “the general secretary

145
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,079
came to our home.”

146
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,629
Featuring glowing pictures of Xi Jinping holding
hands with the common man.

147
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,750
If you ask me, it’s a missed opportunity.

148
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,560
He could have literally lifted that guy out
of poverty.

149
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,290
But this is all part of Xi’s man of the
people persona, like when he sat and ate an

150
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,879
ordinary steamed bun at an ordinary restaurant.

151
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,790
Just don’t call Xi a steamed bun.

152
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,300
Because then you’re going to jail.

153
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,139
Yes, Xi is a man of the people.

154
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,920
As long as the people obey him.

155
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,769
This campaign is also a huge win for the Party
in general.

156
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,980
You know, the Party that’s devoted to serving
the people heart and soul.

157
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,420
My favorite Chinese state-run media, the Global
Times, ran this article about how China’s

158
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:34,990
miraculous poverty alleviation is due to the
Communist Party and China’s socialist system.

159
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,740
But wait, there’s more!

160
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,850
Like how they can use poverty alleviation
to completely redefine human rights.

161
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,971
“Is there a more important human rights
agenda in the world than lifting 100 million

162
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:53,399
people out of poverty in eight years?”

163
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,399
Actually yes.

164
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,610
Have you considered not killing people for
their organs?

165
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,709
Probably not.

166
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,999
Because those organs contribute to GDP.\h

167
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,709
Besides, the Party has more important things
to think about.

168
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:13,649
Like how to use poverty alleviation to criticize
Western democracies...for criticizing China’s

169
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,649
success.

170
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:20,600
And they try to make Western countries like,
oh I don’t know, America, look bad for not

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,529
eliminating poverty the way that China totally
has.

172
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:29,639
And if you question whether China has actually
eliminated poverty, you’re obviously a Western

173
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,639
supremacist.

174
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,350
But while the Chinese Communist Party is having
a field day with this, what happens after

175
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,920
the poverty alleviation campaign is over?

176
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,420
After the propaganda celebration ends, there
could be long term issues.

177
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,800
Like the fact that “Behind the poverty drive
is at least $1 trillion in loans over five

178
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,490
years, and a burden of cost falling increasingly
to local governments.”

179
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,139
Local governments that already have problems
dealing with massive debts.

180
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,670
And then there’s the question of whether
people will go back to being in poverty once

181
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,110
the government aid stops.

182
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,589
“Poverty alleviation official Ou Qingping
warned in December that some people still

183
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,860
reliant on aid had ‘insufficient’ means
to grow wealthier.”

184
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,420
Then he said that “Once alleviation policies
are suspended, they are likely to return to

185
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
poverty."\h

186
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,369
So it looks like China’s poverty alleviation
still has a long way to go.

187
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,259
And you know what that means.

188
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,950
It’ll soon be time for another mass political
campaign.

189
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,759
 And now it’s time for me to answer a
question for a viewer who supports China Uncensored

190
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,940
on the crowd-funding website Patreon.

191
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,870
Go to patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn
more.

192
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,549
Richard Wallberg asks:\h
"What do you think about Xi Jinping supporting

193
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,160
the world economic forum's Great Reset?

194
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,779
Was the CCP virus just a ruse to enforce lockdowns
to enable them to implement the Great Reset?"

195
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,319
Good question, Richard.

196
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,739
We covered The Great Reset on our other channel,
America Uncovered.

197
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:16,250
Xi Jinping might like certain parts of the
great reset, in so far as it's a justification

198
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,670
for giving all governments more power.

199
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:25,019
But Xi Jinping, and the CCP more broadly,
have their own agendas—which are probably

200
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,649
more sinister than the great reset that the
World Economic Forum talks about.

201
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,610
There's no evidence that the CCP Virus is
a ruse to enforce lockdowns.

202
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,220
The virus is real.

203
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,759
And the CCP ultimately needs the people to
work.

204
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,709
If people are out of work and running out
of money for too long, it creates potential

205
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,319
for massive civil unrest.

206
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,600
And that could threaten the CCP's grip on
power.

207
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,060
Thanks for your question, Richard.

208
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,990
And thank you for watching China Uncensored.

209
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,779
I’m Chris Chappell.

210
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:15,369
See you next time.
