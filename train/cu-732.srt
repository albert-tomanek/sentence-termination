1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,270
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,400
China is letting people tunnel

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,100
through the Great Firewall.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,180
You just have to give up

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,600
all of your personal data.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,340
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,050
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,099
So, the Chinese Communist Party has a problem.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,500
It wants to have total control of the Internet
in China.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,659
You know, to protect the Chinese people

11
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,079
from all the harmful things on the web,

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,079
like, anything that might make a person

13
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,899
question why the government should have

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,090
total control over the Internet.

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,090
To do this,

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,140
the Chinese regime built the friendly

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,330
Great Firewall of China.

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,440
The firewall keeps out degenerate Western
influences,

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
like Grumpy Cat,

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,620
so Chinese netizens can focus on

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,450
the much cuter Chinese version,

22
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,630
Snoopybabe.

23
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,630
The problem is,

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,400
it also keeps out loads of really useful websites,

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,190
like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,030
And while the Chinese regime is rather happy

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,850
that the average Chinese netizen

28
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,540
doesn’t have access to Facebook,

29
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,780
it’s concerned that businesses

30
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,670
inside China will suffer.

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,119
What do you do when you can’t access Facebook

32
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,700
to advertise your company to reach overseas
clients?

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,280
What do you do when you can’t even use Gmail?

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,810
That’s why Chinese netizens and businesses
in China

35
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,060
use VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks.

36
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,429
Think of them like a tunnel

37
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:24,920
through the Great Firewall.

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,439
They not only allow access to blocked websites.

39
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,780
They also add an extra layer of security

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,600
for both individuals and corporations.

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,670
They protect people’s data

42
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,869
from leaking onto the internet.

43
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,829
Developers need VPNs to access

44
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,920
sporadically blocked websites like Github.

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,170
Researchers need to access Google Scholar.

46
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,770
Businesses need VPNs to send secure emails.

47
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,770


48
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,909
“VPNs are absolutely critical

49
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,840
to almost any businesses in China,

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,270
large or small—

51
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,389
and especially important

52
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:56,700
for innovative businesses.”

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,119
And that put the Chinese regime in a bind.

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,119
On the one hand,

55
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,119
it needs the Internet

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,119
to boost the economy,

57
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,170
to justify its rule.

58
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,229
On the other hand,

59
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,759
if people used the open Internet

60
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,319
to find out all the things

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,610
the Chinese regime has done,

62
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,690
that would undermine its rule.

63
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,640
But where you see a problem,

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,600
the Communist Party sees an opportunity!

65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,500
Companies need VPNs to function in China.

66
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,700
So what’s an authoritarian regime gonna
do?!

67
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,560
Ban everyone’s VPNs.

68
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,540
Okay, no more private VPNs.

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,650
Now what?

70
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,610
Why, the Chinese regime builds its own VPNs!

71
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,810
Of course, you have to pay to use them.

72
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,420
And any data that goes through

73
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,100
will be monitored by the government.

74
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,500
And since there will be literally no other
option,

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,670
Chinese and foreign companies

76
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,980
will be forced to pay big money...

77
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,510
for the privilege of being tapped,

78
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,980
monitored, and their confidential information

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,920
reported back to the Party.

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,770
Remember, it’s not just individual netizens

81
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,470
and companies affected.

82
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,400
According to the Financial Times,

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,590
embassies have also been affected.

84
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,680
They say it’s a violation

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,970
of the Vienna convention.

86
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,300
Look, embassies need to send

87
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,050
confidential emails.

88
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,910
Like about how frustrating it is

89
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,900
being a diplomat in China.

90
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,620
China’s internet regulators

91
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,890
have been tampering with

92
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,670
individual VPNs for years.

93
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,490
But it had, for the most part,

94
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,940
left internal corporate

95
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,740
and embassy VPNs alone.

96
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,070
It didn’t want to hinder economic growth

97
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,790
or affect international relations.

98
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,520
This is not the case anymore.

99
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,290
After the 19th Party Congress last year,

100
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,650
the Communist Party decided that

101
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,910
surveillance takes precedence,

102
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,770
even over economic development.

103
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,310
Probably because given the choice

104
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,870
of pulling out of China,

105
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,510
or playing by the Communist Party’s rules,

106
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,060
most would be willing to choose the latter.

107
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
Like Apple!

108
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,210
Apple has been more than happy to comply

109
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,960
with China’s strict new Internet laws.

110
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,620
Apple removed 674 VPN apps

111
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,450
from its App Store in China.

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,960
Wow, I didn’t even know there were t

113
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,280
hat many different VPNs to begin with.

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,470
But it’s not all doom and gloom.

115
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,180
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

116
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,350
is closing the last bridge to the outside
Internet.

117
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,250
But that doesn’t mean Chinese people

118
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,790
will never even know what happened.

119
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,260
Because as of now,

120
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,780
the China Uncensored website,

121
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
ChinaUncensored.tv,

122
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,840
is still unblocked in China.

123
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
So what do you think about

124
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,000
China’s VPN extortion ring?

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Leave your comments below—

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
while you still have access to the free Internet...

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,130
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

128
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,810
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

129
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,040
see you next time.

130
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,340
The Chinese regime is making it harder

131
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,940
for people inside and outside of China

132
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,950
to learn the truth.

133
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,440
That’s why China Uncensored is so important—

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,210
and I’m not just tooting my own horn here.

135
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,040
But we can’t survive without

136
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
support from viewers like you.

137
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,210
If you think uncensored information

138
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,380
