00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,490
the Communist Party is putting pressure on
US airlines.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,640
But it’s not going to fly with the White
House.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,920
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,349
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,070
China’s sacred territory is very important

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,390
to the Chinese Communist Party,

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,619
especially when the Party only has

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,089
questionable claims to that sacred territory.

10
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,160
Take the South China Sea for example.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,220
Indisputable territory of China since ancient
times.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,540
Made even more indisputable by the man-made
islands

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,720
armed with missile launchers.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,970
But the Chinese Communist Party

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,660
can’t build missile launchers on everything.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,660
Probably.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,780
That’s why the Party has other ways to give
everyone

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,060
a friendly reminder about what is and isn’t
Chinese territory.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,100
In April, China’s Civil Aviation Administration

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,540
sent a letter to 36 foreign airlines.

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,210
It demanded that they stop referring to Taiwan,

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,350
Hong Kong and Macau as countries or regions

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,040
separate from China.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,950
Here’s a copy of the actual letter,

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,600
obtained by the Washington Post.

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,010
Yes, they’re not separate countries!

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,010
Taiwan, of course,

28
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,240
has its own democratically elected government,

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
its own military, currency, passports,

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,810
pop stars, and border control—

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,890
but as the Communist Party will tell you,

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,690
Taiwan is just a renegade province of China,

33
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,030
not a separate country!

34
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,530
Hong Kong and Macau also have separate governments,

35
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,530
although legally,

36
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,550
they are under the authority

37
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,430
of the People’s Republic of China.

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,350
So no dispute there.

39
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,510
Although since they have their own laws and
border control,

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,390
some people think of them as separate regions.

41
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,460
But not for long!

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,760
Because that letter from China’s Civil Aviation
Administration

43
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,560
warned some airlines that if they failed to
comply

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,820
with the friendly request to stop listing
these...places

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,460
as separate regions and/or countries,

46
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,270
there would be friendly consequences.

47
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,170
This is hardly the first time the Chinese
Communist Party

48
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,610
has pulled this tactic.

49
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,389
In January, fashion brand Zara and Delta Air
Lines

50
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,080
had to apologize for listing Taiwan

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,760
as a country on their websites.

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Later that month,

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,950
hotel chain Marriott suffered the same fate.

54
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,829
But this time, it’s different.

55
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,671
The Trump Administration won’t let

56
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,790
the Chinese Communist Party get away with

57
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,150
bullying US airlines.

58
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,920
Because if the Trump Administration understands
anything,

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,939
it’s bullying.

60
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,560
White House press secretary released this
statement...

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,760
...saying President Trump will “will stand
up for Americans

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,909
resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist
Party

63
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,519
to impose Chinese political correctness

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,549
on American companies and citizens.”

65
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,000
And the statement called the Communist Party’s
demands

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,090
“Orwellian nonsense.”

67
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,200
Because if the Trump Administration understands
anything,

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,340
it’s references to classic 20th century
literature.

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,410
And so the Communist Party responded in a
way

70
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,709
they know will get President Trump’s attention:

71
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,709
a Twitter war.

72
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:07,709
This actual tweet

73
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,290
from China’s State Council Information Office

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,989
asked, “how would you like it

75
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,319
if we listed one of your states as a country?

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,319
Huh?

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,319
Huh???”

78
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,040
I gather that China’s State Council Information
Office

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,330
has never been to Texas.

80
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,480
Or California.

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Or New Hampshire.

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,159
Frankly, we’ll give away Florida.

83
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,840
But seriously, the State Council Information
Office

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,290
makes a great point.

85
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,629
It’s exactly like a Chinese airline

86
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,050
listing Texas as a separate country...

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,859
if Texas had its own military, passports,

88
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,329
currency, and border patrol.

89
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,329
And no,

90
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,870
Walker, Texas Ranger does not count.

91
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,609
The US Embassy in China reposted

92
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,439
the White House’s statement about this

93
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,969
“Orwellian nonsense”

94
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,309
on their Weibo account.

95
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,669
Weibo is China’s version of Twitter.

96
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,669
But the post was censored by Chinese authorities.

97
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,650
Well, censored-ish.

98
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,260
They can’t take it down

99
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,669
without causing a diplomatic incident,

100
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,069
but they can stop other people from reposting
it.

101
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,530
And some Chinese netizens were enjoying the
show.

102
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,129
Before their own comments got censored.

103
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,029
But according to my favorite state-run media,

104
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,349
the Global Times,

105
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,650
other Chinese netizens were furious

106
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,519
that the White House called these tactics

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,370
“Orwellian Nonsense.”

108
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,650
Although some were also confused about

109
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,210
what Orwellian means.

110
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,210
By the way,

111
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,319
George Orwell’s books are not

112
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,340
completely censored in China.

113
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,190
You can buy Chinese translations

114
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,180
of Animal Farm and 1984.

115
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,009
So not understanding references

116
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,169
to classic 20th century literature—

117
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,030
that’s on you, kids.

118
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,050
Trump would be so disappointed.

119
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,460
Anyway, China’s Foreign Ministry went the
route of,

120
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,460
“this is just the price of doing business
in China.”

121
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,220
So what’s the big fuss?

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,349
Many airlines have already tried to adapt.

123
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,440
Like British Airways.

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,960
They used to list Taiwan, Macau, and Hong
Kong

125
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,330
under a drop down menu labeled “countries.”

126
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,500
But earlier this year,

127
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,789
they changed their menu to just say “From.”

128
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,009
Now like I said earlier,

129
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,689
Hong Kong and Macau are officially part of
China,

130
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,320
even though they have their own passports
and governments.

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,229
But Taiwan is a trickier matter.

132
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,330
The Communist Party calls Taiwan a province,

133
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,479
but Taiwan operates like a completely independent
country

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,280
in every way.

135
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,139
Because of this, the Communist Party

136
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,449
has vowed to take over Taiwan,

137
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,780
by force if necessary.

138
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,400
In fact, according to this book...

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,190
...the Communist Party has laid out a comprehensive
plan

140
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,759
to do just that by the year 2020.

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,070
So it’s really awkward when airlines

142
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,669
list Taiwan as a country.

143
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,849
I think the most accurate solution

144
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,580
would be to simply list Taiwan as

145
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,599
“The province of China that China is going
to invade

146
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,389
even though it’s definitely already a province
of China.”

147
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,400
In the past, some airlines got around this
sticky situation

148
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,470
by listing Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan

149
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,310
under a “country/region” menu,

150
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,009
instead of just “country.”

151
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,009
But according to the letter

152
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,889
sent out by China’s Civil Aviation Administration,

153
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:03,509
that no longer flies.

154
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,539
Nope.

155
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,470
Even if it’s under a country/region menu,

156
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,539
it has to say “Taiwan, China”

157
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,090
or “Taiwan region, China”.

158
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,000
Not “Taiwan” by itself.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,630
What are you thinking?!

160
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,680
So it’s getting harder and harder

161
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,099
to please Chinese authorities.

162
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,340
And with China expected to be

163
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,669
the world’s largest air travel market by
2022,

164
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,979
a lot of airlines are feeling the pressure.

165
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:27,979
But the good news is,

166
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,710
it’s not just the US government

167
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,449
that’s noticed this Orwellian nonsense.

168
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,419
Australia is speaking out as well.

169
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,419


170
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,289
So what do you think about this “Orwellian
Nonsense”?

171
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,490
And would you wear a T-shirt that says “Orwellian
Nonsense?”

172
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,370
Because, we’ve made T-shirts that say “Orwellian
Nonsense”.

173
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,370
Seriously.

174
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,880
Click the link below to buy one of these T-shirts.

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,750
The US Embassy and the Global Times

176
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,520
translated Orwellian Nonsense two different
ways in Chinese.

177
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,669
We, of course, went with the Global Times
version.

178
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,099
And no, the shirts are not made in China.

179
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,430
Which is why they’re more expensive.

180
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,979
So buy an obscurely hilarious t-shirt,

181
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,770
and leave your comments below.

182
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,720
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

183
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,590
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

184
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,060
see you next time.

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
Don’t go anywhere!

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,620
Because I’m answering questions from fans
of the show.

187
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,099
This question comes from a member

188
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,960
of our 50-Cent Army on Patreon.

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,220
Largezo asks:

190
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,969
“Is the PRC aware of your existence?”

191
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:31,969
Great question.

192
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,280
Of course they do!

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,389
I’m kind of a big deal.

194
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,440
On two occasions,

195
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,289
I sent faxes to the Chinese consulate in New
York

196
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,400
trying to arrange an interview with Chinese
leader Xi Jinping.

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,650
Why fax?

198
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,650
A

199
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,729
pparently Marx’s relentless march of history

200
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,710
is a little slow when it comes to

201
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,650
the Communist Party’s communication systems.

202
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,539
Oddly enough, the consulate never got back
to me.

203
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,360
But I’m sure I’ll get that interview someday.

204
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
I do know people are watching

205
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,229
China Uncensored in China.

206
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,180
And for reasons I can’t explain,

207
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,810
the chinauncensored.tv website

208
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,580
is not blocked inside China.

209
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,419
So Xi Jinping, if you’re watching,

210
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:12,669
which I know you are,

211
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,980
I’m ready for that interview.

212
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,169
Want your question answered next time?

213
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,000
At the end of each episode on YouTube,

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,960
I’ll answer questions from Patreon supporters.

215
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,659
That is, fans who contribute a dollar or more
per episode.

216
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,410
China Uncensored relies on support from our
viewers,

217
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,669
so this is my thank you to the amazing supporters

218
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,710
who make this show possible.
