00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,830
Hong Kongers Celebrate V for Vendetta Day!

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,529
As violence takes a turn for the worse.

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,140
And Carrie Lam is here to stay

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:15,320
This is China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:16,500
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,410
Before I begin, I just need to remind you

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,990
that YouTube is demonetizing

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,220
nearly all of our Hong Kong episodes.

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,320
We’ve only been able to keep making them

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
because of an amazing outpouring of support

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,310
from fans who contribute through

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,199
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,890
So a big thanks to them,

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,890
and if you can,

15
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,120
please consider supporting the show.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,561
So hey, did you remember, remember

17
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,410
the 5th of November?

18
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,690
Hong Kongers did.

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,289
It’s Guy Fawkes Day.

20
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,750
Or, let’s be real,

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,690
more commonly known as V for Vendetta Day.

22
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,460
Hundreds of protesters took to the streets
in Hong Kong

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,750
wearing Guy Fawkes masks from the movie.

24
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,629
The Hong Kong government outlawed masks a
few weeks ago

25
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:58,879
and as you can see that’s really working
well.

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,559
But that’s not all.

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,460
Remember your college graduation?

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,650
Parading through campus with your friends.

29
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,400
Wearing Guy Fawkes masks to protect your identity

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,870
while protesting your authoritarian government.

31
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,750
Ah, youth.

32
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,860
The protests in Hong Kong have now entered
their 22nd week.

33
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,250
And this week, things got bad.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,350
“What started as a peaceful protest quickly
turned chaotic

35
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,640
when riot police stormed the place

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,130
and a man with a knife went on a stabbing
spree outside.

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,010
District Councilor Andew Chiu tried to intervene

38
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,050
and the attacker turned on him.

39
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,470
The man was finally subdued -

40
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,930
and beaten - by protesters.”

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,780
Wow, props to Andrew Chiu.

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,160
But “the attacker turned on him”

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,580
doesn’t quite do justice.

44
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,550
The attacker bit his ear off.

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,390
Then a few days later, a Pro-Beijing lawmaker

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,130
was approached by a man bearing flowers...

47
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,500
who then stabbed him.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,270
Don’t worry folks, he’s going to be ok.

49
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,830
It’s really almost a miracle that no one
has been killed yet

50
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,960
in direct relation to these protests,

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,830
or else things might really fly off the rail.

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,830
Oh.

53
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,019
Police were using tear gas

54
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,000
to clear protesters out of a parking garage.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,799
You’re not really supposed to use tear gas

56
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,079
in an enclosed space like that,

57
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,159
but I guess at this point,

58
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,069
the police are well beyond “supposed to.”

59
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,379
It’s unclear exactly what happened,

60
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,020
but a student protester fell from the parking
garage.

61
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,349
He was hospitalized for his injuries on Monday,

62
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,560
and he died on Friday.

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,359
Protesters say police directly contributed
to Chow’s death,

64
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,310
not only by tactics to roust protesters,

65
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,430
but also by delaying first responders,

66
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,590
who they say had to proceed to the scene on
foot

67
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,200
after police cars reportedly blocked the ambulance.”

68
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,450
Protesters held an impromptu memorial for
Chow.

69
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,239
And guess who showed up?

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,239
Police.

71
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,280
“‘Do you know you can’t wear masks at
a rally?’

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,709
a police commander said…

73
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,409
‘This is a funeral, are you crazy?’

74
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,609
another man was heard yelling back.”

75
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,420
So people in Hong Kong are on edge.

76
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,580
It doesn’t help that millions of people
there

77
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,930
have been exposed to tear gas

78
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,430
at some point over the past few months.

79
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,579
In that time,

80
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,290
police have shot around 6,000 canisters of
tear gas.

81
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,859
And I can tell you from personal experience,

82
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,099
it doesn’t feel very nice.

83
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,499
But don’t worry, those days are done.

84
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,790
Now, Hong Kong police have switched to

85
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,999
a new version of tear gas made in China.

86
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:37,999
It’s explosive,

87
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,629
and it can burn your skin off.

88
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,239
Not as much of a burn though,

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,239
as when the police call you a cockroach.

90
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,639
Apparently not just protesters.

91
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,639
Anybody.

92
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,829
Even bystanders and journalists.

93
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,440
It’s nice to know the police think of the
citizens

94
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,200
as bugs to be squashed.

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
And if you’re wondering,

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,409
how is Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie
Lam

97
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,700
still in power after all this?

98
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,280
Well, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping,

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,440
the guy who has real power in Hong Kong,

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,370
says Lam isn’t going anywhere.

101
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,689
The two of them are close.

102
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,000
I mean, not physically close.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,409
At all.

104
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,790
But they do dress to match.

105
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,280
But it’s not just Carrie Lam

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,420
who’s receiving messages of support.

107
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,320
A group of Cuban Americans turned up at a
Miami Heat game

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,990
wearing shirts supporting the Hong Kong protesters.

109
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,330
Something about escaping communism

110
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,400
must make you sympathize with other people

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,820
trying to escape Communism.

112
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,940
And people inside Mainland China

113
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,450
also are sending their messages of support

114
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,420
for Hong Kong protesters.

115
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,010
You know how I know?

116
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,260
Because the Party has launched a massive effort

117
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,410
to scrub all those messages from the Chinese
Internet.

118
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,230
But there’s two sides to every issue.

119
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,170
A UK baking competition decide to show its
*support*

120
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,150
for tyranny and oppression.

121
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,400
They disqualified a Hong Kong protest themed
cake.

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Cake International said

123
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,740
“the content and message behind the cake

124
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,540
has been viewed as offensive

125
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,170
and led to complaints from attendees.”

126
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,370
As you can see,

127
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,070
the cake was very offensive.

128
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,900
It even had fake tear gas.

129
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,550
I hope its fake,

130
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,770
because typically you don’t want your cake

131
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,650
to make people cry.

132
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,280
And finally, Hong Kong is banning political
satire...

133
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,300
at its annual Lunar New Year fairs.

134
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,500
Because of safety issues.

135
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,580
People have in the past sold items

136
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,900
that make fun of the government.

137
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,800
Which is very unsafe.

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,020
Gotta get rid of those pro-democracy tote
bags.

139
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
And with that,

140
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,020
I think I’ll answer a question from a Patreon
supporter.

141
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,830
Remember, this show wouldn’t exist

142
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,260
without the support of fans on Patreon,

143
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,650
so be sure to give them a big thanks in the
comments below.

144
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,120
Benja Sophon Sariwatta asks,

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,150
“What would you say to someone who is brainwashed

146
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,520
by the CCP propaganda?”

147
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,860
Well that’s a good question

148
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,121
and unfortunately I don’t have a great answer
to it.

149
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:04,080
It kind of depends on how well you know the
person.

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
A buddy of mine tried to convince me that
Huawei

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,900
was a totally independent company

152
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,640
and I was crazy to think otherwise.

153
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,140
When I told him that by Chinese law,

154
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,550
Huawei would have to turn over data to the
government,

155
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,820
his response was,

156
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,600
“Oh, but it’s okay that the US bombed
Serbia?”

157
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,750
I honestly didn’t know what to say to that.

158
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,560
If it’s a friend or family member,

159
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,210
keep gently trying telling them all the news
that’s coming out.

160
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,080
Better yet, show them videos.

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,640
Of course, if it’s some random person on
the internet,

162
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,280
well, there probably isn’t much you can
say or do to reach them,

163
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,900
so I’d recommend just going outside

164
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,150
and smelling some flowers instead.

165
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,720
Thanks for your question, Benja.

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,780
And if you have a question for me

167
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,470
you want to hear answered on the show,

168
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,890
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

169
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,420
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

170
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,690
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

171
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,390
we would have to shut down the show

172
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,310
if it weren’t for your support.

173
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,000
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,780
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

175
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,640
See you next time.
