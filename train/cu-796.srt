1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,270
Chinese rockets are being launched in America!

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,160
A disease is affecting the Chinese military.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,789
And finally, let the trade wars begin!

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,920
This is China Uncensored

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,190
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,920
I hope all the viewers in the US had a happy
Fourth of July

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,030
celebrating our Independence Day.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,520
Of course, for viewers outside of America,

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,680
I hope you also had a...happy...Wednesday?

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,700
This year, Americans spent almost a billion
dollars

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,329
on Fourth of July fireworks.

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,309
Nothing like celebrating your nation’s freedom

15
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,690
by blowing things up.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,590
And China helps us do it.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,030
“About 70 percent of the professional display
fireworks

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,530
are manufactured in China."

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,399
And "Ninety-nine percent of the backyard consumer
fireworks

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,850
come directly from China.”

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,449
But while Chinese fireworks may be

22
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,579
launching in some parts of America,

23
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,340
there won’t be much of that from the Chinese
Communist Party’s

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,239
People’s Liberation Army.

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,810
At least according to the PLA Daily,

26
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,640
the official paper of the People’s Liberation
Army.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,549
“China’s People’s Liberation Army

28
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,630
is ridden with ‘peace disease.’”

29
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,369
The problem is China hasn’t had had a war
since that one

30
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,210
with Vietnam in the 1970s.

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,210
And honestly,

32
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,280
it wasn’t even a very good one.

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,930
I know, you’re worried about the combat
readiness

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,240
of the Communist Party’s military.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,170
Well don’t be.

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,500
Chinese leader Xi Jinping decided the PLA

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,560
will be a world class military...

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,020
by 2050.

39
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,240
Yes, by the time I’m a grandpa, and Xi Jinping
is...

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,220
still President of China.

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,789
But it turns out, Xi Jinping’s military
reforms

42
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,070
are less about creating a modern fighting
army,

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,390
and more about his own personal war

44
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,590
against his political opponents.

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,090
And that’s a war that’s very active right
now.

46
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,409
According to the PLA Daily,

47
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,530
over the past five years,

48
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,159
“At least 13,000 military officers involved
in corruption

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,840
have been punished.”

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,970
The anti-corruption campaign has been Xi’s
way

51
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,859
of purging powerful figures in the military

52
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,170
and making the PLA more loyal to Xi.

53
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,010
Many high ranking officers purged,

54
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,760
like Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou,

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,200
were tied to Xi’s main nemesis,

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,670
the Guiana Shield Leaf Toad.

57
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,050
I’m sorry, I mean Jiang Zemin.

58
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,120
The resemblance is uncanny.

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,340
These purged officers were what Xi called

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,430
“the big tigers.”

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,569
But now Xi’s focus has shifted from purging

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,110
to what he calls “prohibiting omissions.”

63
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,870
According to retired PLA colonel Yue Gang,

64
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,800
“Apart from corruption,

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,150
job omission is the next key symptom of ‘peace
disease’

66
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,390
in the Chinese military that should be cured.”

67
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,920
Job omission is when Xi Jinping’s political
enemies

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,720
try to subvert him by...literally doing nothing.

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,330
That means instead of conducting normal training
drills,

70
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,640
they...don’t.

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,730
And instead, they just fake the training data.

72
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,670
In other words, the troops aren’t actually
training.

73
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,299
Hence, they have peace disease.

74
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,360
But you know, I think it’s going to be okay.

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,330
At least for anyone who goes to war with China.

76
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,560
Speaking of war...trade war!

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,099
Today the US and China tariffs go into effect.

78
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,689
Too bad the PLA can’t fight the trade war.

79
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,260
Then we’d definitely win.

80
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,760
We’ll have more on this story as it develops.

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,659
Three more American have been evacuated from
China

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,560
following mysterious health problems.

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,870
Several US employees tied to the embassy or
consulates in China

84
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,519
have been sickened after hearing a mysterious
sound.

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,319
There are fears it may be a sonic weapon.

86
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,049
Or as we mentioned before, really inept spying.

87
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,210
But a sonic weapon might not be the only new

88
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,849
experimental weapon in the hands of the PLA.

89
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,780
No, this isn’t the world’s most terrifying
flashlight.

90
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,870
It’s an experimental machine gun laser.

91
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,200
This image was released last month by the

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,540
Chengdu Hengan Police Equipment Manufacturing
Company.

93
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,470
It emits rapid pulses.

94
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,870
But its makers claim it doesn’t do

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,739
anything more than disorient people.

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,140
So basically it’s a giant strobelight.

97
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,520
I hear it also plays EDM.

98
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,389
China is actually developing

99
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,009
a wide range of experimental laser weapons.

100
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,500
Here’s another one: the ZKZM-500.

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,250
Official documents say it’s “non-lethal.”

102
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,990
But they also say it can produce

103
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,240
pain beyond endurance,

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,949
and “cause the ‘instant carbonization’

105
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,030
of human skin and tissues.”

106
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,990
So...not actually non-lethal.

107
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,199
Also, it’s also only 7 pounds,

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,400
has a range of half a mile,

109
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,820
makes no sound,

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,950
and its beam is invisible.

111
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,650
One researcher on the project said,

112
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,660
“Nobody will know where the attack came
from.

113
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,500
It will look like an 
accident.”

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,140
Wow, this dissident spontaneously carbonized!

115
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,060
Must've been an accident!

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,650
Glad that’s in the hands of the world’s

117
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,860
most trustworthy police.

118
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,979
The good news is,

119
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,130
since this weapon is so far beyond

120
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,200
anything remotely out there,

121
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,509
some experts think the researchers

122
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:18,620
may have just been telling a tall tale.

123
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,160
So what do you think of the People’s Liberation
Army’s

124
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
peaceful disease and laser weapons?

125
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,230
Leave your comments below.

126
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,570
And before we wrap up,

127
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,430
it’s that time when I answer questions

128
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,389
from fans who support China Uncensored

129
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,509
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

130
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:34,950
Dafydd Nicholas asks

131
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,419
“Why does the Chinese population have less
criticism

132
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,729
of central government control than westerners
do?”

133
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,190
Well you see Dafydd,

134
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,449
Chinese people simply aren’t ready for democracy.

135
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,889
I mean, yes Chinese people in Hong Kong and
Taiwan

136
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,789
have been successfully electing their leaders
for decades,

137
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55,280
but Mainland Chinese people

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,270
simply need the Chinese Communist Party.

139
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,880
The Communist Party assures us of this.

140
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,810
That’s why even though there are some

141
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,720
village-level elections in Mainland China,

142
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,099
the candidates have to be handpicked by the
Party.

143
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,600
Otherwise people would get confused.

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,880
That’s why you don’t hear much criticism

145
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,560
from the Chinese population

146
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,780
about the control the Communist Party has.

147
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,210
The kind of control that lets the Party dictate

148
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,840
what you watch on tv,

149
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
if you reincarnate...

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,780
Even when you die!

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,880
“Furthermore, there's a must follow order.

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,330
No one can die inside of Beijing.

153
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,480
Local officials would be held accountable
if anyone did.”

154
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,599
The people clearly love the Communist Party,

155
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,250
which must be why you don’t hear them

156
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,540
publicly complaining.

157
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,569
Also in the event that someone does complain,

158
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,669
the Party has these guys.

159
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,789
Thanks for you question Dafydd.

160
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:45,789
And remember,

161
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,740
if you want a shot at having your question
answered

162
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,310
on the next episode,

163
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,150
consider supporting China Uncensored on Patreon.

164
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,610

thanks to viewers like you.

166
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,110
Thanks for watching.

167
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,420
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

168
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,720
see you next time.

169
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,280
Hey, want the latest China news?

170
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,660
Subscribe to China Uncensored!

171
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,900
And turn that notification bell on to make
sure

172
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,880
you find out when new episodes are out.

173
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,150
We publish a brand new episode

174
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,349
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—

175
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:15,949
and sometimes Saturday.

176
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,780
So check back frequently

177
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
but I’ve heard from many fans

178
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
that YouTube won’t notify you,

179
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
even if you have notifications on.

180
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,280
I guess they don’t like China Uncensored
too much.
