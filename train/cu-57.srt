00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,360
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,360
President Trump goes back in time

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,320
to the 1970s

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,960
to stop a master criminal

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,420
from stealing top secret technology.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,780
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,300
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,800
On Monday August 14,

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,920
President Donald Trump announced an investigation

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,460
into China’s unfair trade practices.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,260
“The theft of intellectual property by foreign
countries

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,680
costs our nation millions of jobs

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,510
and billions and billions of dollars

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,379
each and every year.

15
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:36,379
For too long,

16
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,289
this wealth has been drained from our country

17
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,960
while Washington has done nothing.”

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,199
Yeah, Washington.

19
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,469
All you do is hang around

20
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,100
with that smug look on your face.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,019
Anyway, Trump authorized

22
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,389
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer

23
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:54,280
to use the Trade Act of 1974

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,649
to investigate China’s unfair policies and
practices—

25
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:58,969
especially with regard to

26
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,859
the theft of American intellectual property.

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,530
What’s that, Shelley?Trump actually ordered
Lighthizer

28
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,750
to look into whether to investigate China

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,510
for unfair trade practices?

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,570
So it’s like a pre-investigation investigation.

31
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,570
But wait!

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,040
My favorite Chinese state-run media

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,960
was quick to inform us that Trump’s trade
war,

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,440
sorry, investigation,

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,200
sorry, pre-investigation,

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,990
could backfire.

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,890
It says “China is expected to retaliate.”

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,950
And then it suggests that

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,950
“China should make use

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,120
of the World Trade Organization mechanism

41
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,310
to sue the US for trade protectionism.”

42
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,170
The angry reaction from Chinese state-run
media

43
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,510
tells us one thing:

44
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,600
Trump’s pre-investigation is a great idea.

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,860
Even Democrats are supporting

46
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,180
Trump’s tougher stance on China trade.

47
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,880
Here’s what’s behind it.

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,990
For decades, the Chinese Communist Party

49
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,380
has been using a variety of unfair

50
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,630
and even downright illegal methods

51
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,570
to steal foreign technology

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,480
and then use it to outcompete the companies

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,820
that invented that technology.

54
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,430
Remember how I talked about WeChat?

55
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,409
Yeah, they borrowed a lot of their ideas

56
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,730
from foreign companies.

57
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,400
But what President Trump is referring to is
more specific.

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,340
It’s about investigating whether the CCP

59
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,260
is forcing or pressuring American companies

60
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,170
to share their intellectual property

61
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,120
with Chinese companies.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,819
The CCP has the long-term goal

63
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,890
of having Chinese companies learn from Western
companies

64
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,960
and eventually replace them.

65
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
For example,

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,810
Ford Motor Company wanted to open

67
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,090
a bunch of car manufacturing plants in China.

68
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,640
But the Chinese government had a requirement:

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,580
Ford had to do it as a joint venture

70
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,420
with a local Chinese company,

71
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,880
Chang’an Motors.

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,860
And as another condition of access

73
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,250
to the Chinese market,

74
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,400
the Chinese government forced Ford to open

75
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,230
a research and development laboratory in China,

76
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,570
that they also had to share with Chang’an
Motors.

77
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,300
There was a similar case with General Motors.

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
GM wanted to sell its electric hybrid Volt
car in China.

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,020
The Chinese government provides huge subsidies

80
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,660
on qualifying electric vehicles,

81
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,610
as much as $19,000 off the retail price

82
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,800
of each car.

83
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,320
It’s to encourage Chinese consumers to buy
them.

84
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,220
But they refused to give the subsidy for GM’s
Volt.

85
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,530
That is, until GM agreed to transfer

86
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,890
some of their highly sensitive engineering
technology

87
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,830
to a local Chinese competitor.

88
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,760
Here’s another example:

89
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,070
Under a recent Chinese cybersecurity law,

90
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,860
US technology companies are required

91
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,569
to store user data from Chinese customers

92
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,750
on servers inside China.

93
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,020
And according to this article,

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
technology firms are forced

95
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,460
to “turn over source code and encryption
software

96
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,610
to the government,

97
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,099
potentially giving the Chinese government

98
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,069
a back door into private data

99
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,550
and proprietary technologies.”

100
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,190
Plus, this article about Apple says that

101
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,370
provincial authorities plan to

102
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,550
“create a working committee

103
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,910
chaired by communist party members

104
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,280
to oversee the US company’s iCloud facility”

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,270
that they’re building in China.

106
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,120
And I could go on and on with examples,

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,020
but you get the idea.

108
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,239
The CCP is forcing US companies

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,440
to turn over intellectual property

110
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,750
in exchange for being allowed

111
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,849
to do business in China.

112
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,379
So what President Trump did on Monday

113
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,520
was authorize US Trade Representative Lighthizer

114
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,000
to determine whether China should be investigated

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,560
for this under the Trade Act of 1974.

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,940
If Lighthizer decides to investigate,

117
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,690
and then if unfair trade practices are found,

118
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,280
the president can punish China

119
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,460
by imposing tariffs or other restrictions.

120
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
“And this is just the beginning.

121
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,730
I want to tell you that.

122
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,841
This is just the beginning.”

123
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,050
The Trade Act of 1974 was used widely

124
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,210
during the Reagan era,

125
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,410
but hasn’t been used as much in recent years,

126
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,160
because of a requirement to work with

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
the World Trade Organization before using
it,

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,190
which Trump has implied he might not do.

129
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,540
But it’s not like previous administrations

130
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,810
did nothing about the Chinese Communist Party’s

131
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,199
intellectual property theft.

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,470
For example, under President Obama,

133
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,500
the White House focused on cracking down

134
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,150
on the CCP stealing intellectual property

135
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,920
by using hacking and cyber spying.

136
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,490
The Justice Department even brought criminal
charges

137
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,180
against PLA soldiers for hacking into US companies,

138
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,990
including Westinghouse and US Steel.

139
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,180
But it’s not an easy issue to deal with,

140
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,000
since the Communist Party’s intellectual
property theft

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,180
stretches back for decades.

142
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
According to this article,

143
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,150
“China’s relentless quest to be a technology
leader

144
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,530
has deep roots,

145
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,650
stretching as far back as the 1950s.”

146
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,720
And in March of 1986,

147
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,530
the CCP began the “863 Program.”

148
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,530
A

149
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,240
ccording to the Office of the National Counterintelligence
Executive,

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,100
Project 863 “provides funding and guidance

151
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,979
for efforts to clandestinely acquire US technology

152
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,690
and sensitive economic information.”

153
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,699
That was 1986.

154
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,330
But China’s intellectual property theft

155
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,850
really kicked off in 2001,

156
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,710
when China got access to the World Trade organization.

157
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,870
President Clinton did the leg work

158
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,009
to get China into the WTO,

159
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,330
and President Bush finished the job.

160
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,110
Their idea was to give US companies

161
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,550
better access to the Chinese market.

162
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,630
But what US companies got was this:

163
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,860
“Congressional leaders say China is engaged

164
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,720
in economic espionage on a scale

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,100
never seen before.”

166
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,580
So maybe, just maybe,

167
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,290
the WTO mechanisms aren’t doing

168
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,360
what they’re supposed to

169
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,880
to protect American companies.

170
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,259
That’s why President Trump is pulling

171
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,630
an obscure 1974 law out of the dusty,

172
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,449
avocado-green filing cabinet—

173
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,110
and putting it to its original purpose:

174
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,290
Giving the US government the power

175
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,820
to punish foreign countries

176
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,980
for unfair trade practices.

177
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,330
So will work?

178
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,259
Well, it’s going to be a long process.

179
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,259
For example,

180
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,259
if the US trade representative

181
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,480
decides to investigate China,

182
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,960
it may take up to a year for that to finish.

183
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,050
But one thing’s for sure.

184
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,669
The CCP doesn’t like it.

185
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,389
And they wouldn’t express “grave concern”

186
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,919
if it were nothing.

187
