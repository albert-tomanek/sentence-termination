bjbj,(,( China s First Lady: Upbeat, Presentable,
Great Closing Act for Student Massacre Hello,

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,309
soon-to-be news-knowers; this is China Uncensored,
I m your host Chris Chappell. Well, the United

3
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,910
States has them, France and Britain occasionally
produce them, and they re the envy of less

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,110
fortunate states around the world though North
Korea has recently astonished everyone by

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:32,330
obtaining its own. No, not nuclear weapons
glamorous first ladies. Now China has recently

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,020
joined the elite of countries whose first
spouse makes her own headlines. New Communist

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,120
Party head Xi Jinping recently went abroad
with his wife, Peng Liyuan, and she was the

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,910
one turning heads. No, not Xi; she. Uh, that
is, she (pointing exasperatedly at picture)

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,910
Ms. Peng! Mr. Xi may have too many years of
dumplings and mind-numbing bureaucracy under

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,180
his belt to look dashing and it s probably
been years since he dashed anywhere. But Peng

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,070
Liyuan has for years been one of China s biggest
celebrity singers, and a general in the People

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,870
s Liberation Army, to boot. And her predecessors
as first lady were, uh, well. She adds something

13
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,700
to the role. s also famous enough that, when
Xi Jinping was chosen as China s new Communist

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,680
Party leader, many people just referred to
him as Peng Liyuan s husband. You see, she

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,840
s more famous than Xi, and she and Xi combine
their fame to that Xi s even more famous and

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,520
uh, moving on Anyway, it was all going according
to plan a bright, upbeat first lady was finally

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,760
making China look a little more friendly and
dynamic on the world stage, and instead of

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,760
searching online for censored things like
Tiananmen massacre, tons of impressionable

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,150
Chinese youth were looking for things like
Peng Liyuan s blouse. Then that got censored

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,070
too. No joke. Anyway, the bright and shiny,
Kennedy-esque image that Xi and Peng project

21
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,210
has now been overshadowed for some people,
by a recently-revealed photo of Peng in full

22
00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:00,049
army gear, singing to armed troops, in Tiananmen
Square. Oh yeah, it s also in 1989. Shortly

23
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:05,600
after that massacre that never happened. Apparently,
Peng was dispatched by the PLA to sing reassuring,

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,979
patriotic songs to the young soldiers who
had recently been forced to gun down thousands

25
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:16,019
of protesting students. Needless to say, she
doesn t put this one on her resume. It s worth

26
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,379
noting that she might herself have been targeted
if she d turned down the assignment even the

27
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,879
official Communist Party leader of the time
was thrown out for supporting the students

28
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,959
too much. But anyway, while her husband talks
about achieving the Chinese Dream and Peng

29
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,529
smiles and promotes vegetable eating, like
all good first ladies, it might be worth remembering

30
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:38,349
that China is still a bit different from other
countries in some important regards. On the

31
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,540
outside, it may start looking like Kennedy
s Camelot inside, it s still more like Stalin
