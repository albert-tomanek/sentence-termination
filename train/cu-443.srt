1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,960
China’s military pushes forward

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Threatening Taiwan and challenging the US

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Plus, you won’t believe\h
what’s censored on Chinese TV

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,360
The war for Taiwan is getting closer.\h

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,720
But first, you can help us continue to\h
uncensor China by joining what I call the\h\h

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,160
China Uncensored 50 Cent Army. All it takes is\h
as little as a dollar per episode on the crowd\h\h

perks you get on Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored. \h

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,240
So last week, I told you Chinese\h\h

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,800
jets performed a pincer maneuver,\h
surrounding Taiwan on three sides.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,680
This week, things are getting worse.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,320
On Monday, China said an aircraft carrier\h
group was conducting exercises close to the\h\h

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,560
island. Taiwan's defense ministry said 15\h
Chinese aircraft, including 12 fighters,\h\h

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
entered its air defense identification zone.\h

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
The Chinese aircraft carrier was the Liaoning.\h\h

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,160
It’s China’s first functional aircraft\h
carrier. This was a major escalation.\h\h

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,680
The Chinese forces conducted exercises to\h
the east and west of the island of Taiwan.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,760
China claimed it was just a\h
routine training exercise.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
Which is true. Training to\h
invade Taiwan is now routine.\h

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,040
But Taiwan’s Foreign Minister responded to\h
the “exercises” with some pretty strong words.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
“Our defense ministry is very\h
determined in defending ourselves.\h\h

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,320
We are willing to defend ourselves and (it) is\h
without any question. And we will fight the war\h\h

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
if we need to fight a war. And if we need\h\h

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,680
to defend ourselves to the very last day, we\h
will defend ourselves to the very last day.”

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
How did China respond?

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,760
“China sent more fighter jets into\h
Taiwan's air defense zone on Wednesday.”

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,560
The US military is warning there’s a\h
rising risk China will invade Taiwan.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Now what ever would lead them to that conclusion?

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,720
But the US and Australia are\h
working together on contingencies\h\h

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,000
around a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\h
Here’s Michael Goldman, the charge d’affaires\h\h

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,320
at the U.S. Embassy in Canberra, on The Australian\h
National University’s National Security Podcast.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,680
“I think we’re committed as allies to working\h
together, not only in making our militaries\h\h

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,040
interoperable and functioning well together\h
but also in strategic planning. And when\h\h

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,920
you look at strategic planning, it covers the\h
range of contingencies that you’ve mentioned,\h\h

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,760
of which Taiwan is obviously\h
an important component.”

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,680
But the Chinese Communist Party is also\h
preparing. Here’s a great idea from Hu Xijin\h\h

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,520
the editor in Chief of my favorite\h
state run media, the Global Times.\h\h

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,040
This was in response to a Chinese netizen\h
on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
“I will catch you [the young male netizen]\h
and send you to bomb the bunkers on [Taiwan]\h\h

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,000
as a member of the commando. If you dare\h
to run away, I will shoot you from behind.”

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
So it sounds like the Chinese people are\h
all on board for an invasion of Taiwan.\h\h

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
Whether they want to be on board or not.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,440
The genocide of Uyghurs in China is turning into a\h
real PR disaster for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Who knew people would be\h
so touchy about genocide?!

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
Some people are suggesting a\h
boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics\h\h

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,920
could put pressure on the regime. Here’s\h
US State Department Spokesman Ned Price\h\h

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
answering a question about the\h
US and allies joining a boycott.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:57,440
“It is something that we certainly wish to\h
discuss. A coordinated approach will be not only\h\h

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,520
in our interest but also in the interest of our\h
allies and partners. So, this is one of the issues\h\h

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,680
that is on the agenda, both now and going forward,\h\h

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,440
and when we have something to\h
announce, we will be sure to do that.”

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
And now the State Department\h
has something to announce!

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
They aren’t going to do it.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
The White House also says a\h
boycott is not on the table.

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,480
China is certainly warning it will not\h
tolerate a boycott of its Olympics.\h

57
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,600
But there are still growing calls for at\h
least a partial boycott of the Olympics.\h\h

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,200
Like the idea from New York\h
Times columnist Nicholas Kristof\h\h

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,840
that athletes could participate, but\h
government officials and companies shouldn’t.

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,960
That’s funny. He thinks the Olympics are\h
about athletics and not corporations.\h

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,720
But there is one kind of boycott\h
the Chinese regime encourages:\h\h

62
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,800
a boycott of Western brands that refuse to\h
use cotton made with Uyghur slave labor.

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
More after the break.

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,960
Welcome back. The Chinese regime is going hard\h
against some Western companies, like H&M and Nike.\h\h

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
They’re facing an official\h
boycott in China, because\h\h

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,040
they refuse to use slave\h
labor cotton from Xinjiang.

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
The problem is, these are popular brands in China.\h\h

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
Sometimes people even show up on\h
television wearing these clothes.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Not to worry, the Chinese regime\h
has figured out a surefire way to\h\h

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,680
completely erase them from the public memory.\h
By making TV shows blur out their logos.

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Wait, unless the guys were actually naked.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,920
Even large groups of people had\h
their clothing logos blurred out.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,880
Yes Anti-China forces must be blurred to\h
protect the feelings of the Chinese people.

74
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
Wait, what’s going on?!\h

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
The Chinese Communist Party is\h
very proud of its Covid vaccines.\h\h

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,120
They even require foreigners to take a\h
Chinese vaccine to get into the country.

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
But it turns out, Chinese officials\h\h

78
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
might be a little less enthusiastic\h
about the Chinese vaccines.\h\h

79
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,320
Leaked documents show Chinese\h
officials trying to dodge vaccinations.

80
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,240
For example, “In a town called Xintai, only three\h
out of 66 officials have gotten vaccinated, with\h\h

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,840
another two on the registration list—showing a\h
dismal willingness rate of less than 10 percent.”

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,200
Meanwhile, Chinese health officials said they\h
plan to vaccinate 70-80 percent of the population.\h\h

83
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,040
“In some cases, overzealous officials have gone\h\h

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,720
door to door to vaccinate residents and even\h
threatened to blacklist the uncooperative.”

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,640
I guess the other 20-30 percent that won’t be\h
vaccinated are the officials and their families.

86
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
You know, in other countries,\h
like Canada, vaccine corruption\h\h

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,040
means the rich and powerful trying to get the\h
coronavirus vaccine before they’re eligible.

88
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,440
In China, vaccine corruption means\h
the rich and powerful trying to\h\h

89
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
avoid getting Chinese vaccines whenever possible.\h

90
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,040
Yet another Chinese official\h
has been sacked for corruption.\h\h

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,920
This time for owning nearly\h
3000 real estate properties.

92
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
“Xu Changyuan, a former high-ranking CCP official,\h\h

93
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,520
was involved in mafia-linked assets\h
worth more than $1.52 billion.”

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,840
And Xu’s family sure used mafia tactics.

95
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,920
“The Xu family employed\h
violence in collecting debts.\h\h

96
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,640
An investigation showed they cut some debtors’\h
Achilles tendons, forced some into cutting off\h\h

97
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,440
one of their fingers as a punishment or\h
subjected others to illegal detention.”

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
Now this may surprise you,\h
but according to local reports\h\h

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,880
Xu was also very active in the genocide\h
against Falun Gong practitioners.

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,320
Falun Gong is a spiritual group the communist\h
regime has been persecuting for 20 years—killing\h\h

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,840
them and selling their organs\h
in state-run hospitals.\h\h

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I mean, you’re not a good communist regime\h
if you can’t make a little profit, right?

103
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,160
And now it’s time for me to read a question or\h
comment from a member of the China Uncensored 50\h\h

104
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Cent Army. Those are fans who support the show on\h
Patreon by pledging a dollar or more per episode.

105
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,400
Steve M says, “I understand the desire to\h
boycott the Beijing Olympics. I think it\h\h

106
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,840
would be more effective to go to the Olympics\h
and then have all the non-Chinese participants\h\h

107
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,160
carry flags for Taiwan, Tibet, Xijiang, etc\h
and see how China tries to censor that.”

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,360
Well, Steve, that’s an interesting idea.\h
If there were an entire stadium filled with\h\h

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,840
people holding flags for those places,\h
it would certainly make a huge impact.

110
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,240
But it probably wouldn’t get that far.

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,520
If you’re talking about the Olympic athletes\h
carrying flags for Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang,\h\h

112
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,080
they would get in trouble.\h
They could possibly even\h\h

113
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,800
get disqualified from participating in the Games.\h

114
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,960
That’s according to a new rule from\h
the International Olympic Committee.

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,200
“Athletes are barred from conducting protests\h
or demonstrations on the field of play,\h\h

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,320
in the Olympic Village, during medal ceremonies,\h\h

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
or during the opening or closing\h
ceremonies of the games.”

118
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,640
And if you’re talking about ordinary audience\h
members holding flags for those places,\h\h

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
well that would still be hard to pull off.\h

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,040
China has an incredible surveillance system.\h
From the moment you land at the airport,\h\h

121
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
to inside your hotel lobby, to\h
the train to the Olympic events,\h\h

122
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,840
to the security measures at the venue—Chinese\h
authorities can track your every move.

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
If you’re carrying a Tibetan\h
flag, they’ll know about it.\h\h

124
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,240
And if you try to organize a mass protest\h
like this—even while you’re in the US—they’ll\h\h

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,920
know ahead of time. Try creating a Facebook\h
group! You think just because Facebook is\h\h

126
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,840
banned in China, Chinese police don’t\h
use it to monitor people overseas?\h

127
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,400
The one thing Chinese authorities can’t do,\h
is force people to come to the Olympics.\h\h

128
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,240
Well, they can’t force non-Chinese people\h
to come. So a boycott is one of the few\h\h

129
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,200
effective things people in the West can do,\h
without getting detained in China for it.

130
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,920
And if politicians and companies in the West\h
refused to support the 2022 Olympics, it would\h\h

131
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,640
be a big embarrassment for the CCP. That’s why\h
just the serious threat of a boycott might be\h\h

132
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,520
enough to get them to make concessions—like\h
letting independent inspectors into Xinjiang.

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
