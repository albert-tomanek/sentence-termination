00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,939
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:03,350
the Panama Papers are out

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,990
and they’re not looking so good for China.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,600
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,430
The Panama Papers. The thing everyone’s
talking about!

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,180
What are they? A sign capitalism is working!

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,740
It’s the biggest data leak in history.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,520
An anonymous source leaked eleven-and-a-half
million documents from the world’s fourth

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,180
biggest offshore law firm,

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,340
Mossack Fonseca, based in Panama.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,870
Wikileaks? Just a drip.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,120
Edward Snowden? More like snowed in

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,600
by the avalanche of data coming out in the
Panama Papers.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,420
Contained in 2.6 terabytes of data. Or roughly
2 million of these guys.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,579
The Panama Papers reveal a wealth of information
about the wealth of some of the wealthy people

16
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,660
in the world.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:02,230
They tell us that at least 140 politicians,
including 12 national leaders, their families,

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,930
or just their good buddies

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,960
have used Mossack Fonseca to dump their money
into overseas tax havens.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,210
The Guardian calls it... “offshore pandemonium.”

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,190
The process is technically legal.

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:21,020
It allows people and companies to take advantage
of low or nonexistent tax rates in places

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,430
like Panama and the Cayman Islands,

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,040
so they don’t have to pay as much in taxes
at home.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,939
Tax havens are also great places to hide money,

26
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,759
since there's very little transparency.

27
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,170
There’s a good summary here from TestTube
News.

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,970
And don’t worry! You benefit from tax havens,
too.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,600
Ever use Amazon, Apple, or Google?

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,490
They all use them. And since you’re watching
this on YouTube, which Google owns,

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,850
you’re taking part in the wonderful web
of tax havens right now.

32
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,600
Yes, capitalism is great!

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
And perhaps no one knows this as well as

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,409
the Communist Party of China.

35
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,009
"So as for the so-called documents you mentioned

36
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:08,219
I'm afraid we first must get clarification
and understand what it's really about."

37
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,999
Ok, here's some clarification on those so-called
documents.

38
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:18,840
The Panama Papers revealed that one third
of Mossack Fonseca's business came just from

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,999
China, including Hong Kong.

40
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,510
They have more offices in China than in any
other country.

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,139
At least 8 family members of current and former
members of China’s supreme ruling body,

42
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,559
the Politburo Standing Committee, have been
exposed in the Panama Papers.

43
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,249
Jackie Chan got in on the action, too!

44
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:41,359
But again, this is all technically legal.

45
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:46,430
Tax havens just make sure that wealthy people
don’t have to pay as much in taxes.

46
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,219
Because if wealthy people give their money
to the government,

47
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:55,159
it might be spent on wasteful things, like
education, healthcare, and social services.

48
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,870
That’s way less practical than, say, this.

49
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,019
Sorry, I mean this.

50
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,209
But unlike in other countries, in China,

51
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,989
the wealthy and powerful aren’t just trying
to avoid taxes.

52
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,699
They have another reason for using offshore
accounts, too.

53
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:16,040
“China’s economy is slowing, and Chinese
citizens are getting nervous.

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,969
They’re sending money overseas at an unprecedented
rate.”

55
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:23,239
But it's not just the slowing economy.

56
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,120
As Willy Lam, a political analyst with the
Chinese University of Hong Kong told the BBC,

57
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,089
it’s "simply because there is very little
faith in the future of the Party."

58
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:41,059
"So there is all this insecurity in China
for the wealthy people and for the politicians,

59
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,820
of course that created a lot of demand for
these offshore companies.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,680
In other words, even the families of top Chinese leaders

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,900
don’t want all of their money stored in China

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,069
where it could be seized in a corruption investigation,

63
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,369
or the political system could simply just
implode.

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,200
But this is all a bit embarrassing for Chinese
leader Xi Jinping.

65
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,879
Especially because it comes in the midst of
his anti-corruption campaign;

66
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,499
and especially because he just came out with
his Three Stricts and Three Earnests slogan;

67
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:19,819
and especially because his own brother-in-law
was named in the Panama Papers.

68
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:23,590
So is it hypocritical of Xi to be talking
about anti-corruption

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,290
when three of the most powerful men in China

70
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,500
have had family members who’ve used offshore accounts?

71
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,139
Yes, but that’s besides the point.

72
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,050
Because as I’ve said many times,

73
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,300
Xi’s anti-corruption campaign was never
really about stopping corruption.

74
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,120
It’s about using these corruption investigations
to eliminate his political rivals.

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,729
So obviously the Panama Papers have become
fairly politically sensitive in China.

76
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,759
How are authorities dealing with it?

77
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,430
Denial.

78
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,699
"We will not comment on such groundless accusations."

79
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,479
And of course, censorship.

80
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,129
They’re even purging the word “Panama”
from the Chinese Internet.

81
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,129
Good thing China has an alternative to Panama.

82
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,949
So while some Chinese netizens are lost...

83
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,150
others have created a workaround:

84
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,120
Using homophones for “Panama”

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
that is, different characters with the same
sound.

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,830
Like this user, who wrote,

87
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,990
“Looks like even Buddha had an account in
Panama.”

88
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,879
What we know so far about the Panama Papers
is only the tip of the iceberg.

89
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,919
The leaked documents themselves haven't been
made public,

90
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,090
so we don't know the extent of what’s in
all of those floppy disks.

91
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,319
And Mossack Fonseca is only the fourth largest
offshore law firm.

92
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,819
There's plenty more that we don't know.

93
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,629
One thing is clear though:

94
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,439
Wealthy Chinese are increasingly moving their
money out of China,

95
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,310
which is not a good sign.

96
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,270
Unless you’re Donald Trump...

97
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,759
“I love China. I sold an apartment for $55
million to a Chinese gentleman.”

98
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,129
...and you don’t ask questions about where
the money comes from.

99
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,629
Thanks for watching China Uncensored. What
do you think about the Panama Papers?

100
