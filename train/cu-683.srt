1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,760
Millions of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,720
have been put in Chinese Concentration Camps

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:15,920
While the international community debates

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Is what the Chinese Communist Party\h
doing to the Uyghurs genocide?

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
Sure, they’re being put in\h
massive concentration camps.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,880
And chained, shaved Uyghurs being\h
rounded up onto trains sure looks bad.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,080
And of course independent\h
reports confirm it’s genocide.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,320
The problem is, there’s a lot of money to be\h
made in China! Just look at its bond market!

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,200
This is why you get companies like Apple and Nike\h
lobbying against the Uyghur Forced Labor Act.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
It’s hard to carry on normal relations\h
with a country committing genocide.\h\h

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,720
And so many Western democracies that say they\h
stand for human rights, are waffling about\h\h

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,200
whether to label what the Chinese Communist\h
Party is doing to Uyghurs as genocide.\h

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,120
The Trump Administration labeled it\h
genocide. But now the Biden administration\h\h

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
is reviewing that decision.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,480
Canada’s parliament also labeled it genocide.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
But Canadian Prime Minister Justin\h
Trudeau and his cabinet didn’t want to.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,160
Australia and Turkey have\h
rejected the genocide label.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,960
I mean, just because what the Chinese\h
Communist Party is doing to the Uyghurs\h\h

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,320
is evil, doesn’t mean it’s that bad,\h
right? We can still do business with them.

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,520
Which is why today I’m having on Uyghur\h
writer, linguist and activist Abduweli\h\h

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,680
Ayup to talk about what it was like for him\h
inside one of these Chinese concentration camps.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
Thanks for joining me today.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Thank you for having me.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,680
So, for some reason, there's an international\h
debate going on about whether what the Chinese\h\h

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,600
Communist Party is doing to the Uyghurs\h
genocide. Now, you have firsthand experience\h\h

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,720
with what is happening to the Uyghurs. How\h
did you end up in a concentration camp?

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,720
It is because of I had the Uyghur\h
mother language kindergarten,\h\h

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,960
and the because of this,\h
China put me in the prison.

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,640
You are, so you were put in a concentration\h
camp because you tried to start a kindergarten.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, it's because of we are\h
Uyghur, and I'm willing to have\h\h

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
my Uyghur kindergarten for Uyghur kids.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
To save your language.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
To save, to preserve their language.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,560
So, what happened to you once you\h
were inside the concentration camp?

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
When I was inside the concentration\h
camp, first of all (silence)\h\h

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,280
rape, it happened, and then\h\h

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,680
torture: electric, electricize, electric with the\h
electric stick, electricize it and indoctrination\h\h

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:23,680
with propaganda against Uyghur culture, and\h
against Uyghur identity and against human dignity.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,240
And this, this is basically how all\h
the Uyghurs are treated in these camps.\h\h

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,640
It doesn't matter if they try to cooperate or not.

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,440
It's all Uyghurs are experiencing\h
like this in the concentration camp.\h\h

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,760
It doesn't matter, you are cooperating or not.\h
There is less or more, heavier or lighter,\h\h

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,640
but it's happening through every Uyghur\h
who are in concentration camp right now.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,800
How do you have heavier or lighter rape?

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,960
Lighter is the ones happened only once, like me.\h
And heavier is the one who happened repeatedly.\h\h

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:19,440
And lighter is the one happened only once\h
or twice. But the heavier one is for a long\h\h

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:29,520
time with different position. And mainly aim is\h
just ruin your dignity. Just ask others that,\h\h

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,040
just ask other prisoners, other camps detainees\h
that. Yes, this is the step you're willing to\h\h

50
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,560
have if you are not cooperate with us. If you\h
are not lose your dignity, lose your identity,\h\h

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,920
lose your culture. This is the ending;\h
this is the like challenge you will have.

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,360
Oh, God. So what happens to the\h
family members outside the camps?

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,120
The main problem is for them because they don't\h
know what happened to them. The like I stayed\h\h

54
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,360
there in 15 months, and my family members that\h
don't know they are a mind and what am I doing?\h\h

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:27,520
Am I alive or not? This kind of like it is very\h
hard when you think that like at the time I asked\h\h

56
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:38,160
the interrogator that yes, sentence me 10 years,\h
15 years it's okay. But tell me when then I will,\h\h

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,000
I will see my parents. When I will see my family\h
members. When I will see my daughter and my wife.\h\h

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Like there's no this kind of exact date. There is\h
no like exact, exact like saying that, yes, you\h\h

59
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,960
are this. And you will have this in this amount\h
of time. There's no this kind of like, like.

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,040
There's no rule of law.\h

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,640
There, there's like a main\h
thing is there is no logic.\h\h

62
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,640
There is no specific rule you need to follow.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,440
And again, this happened to you because you\h
tried to start a Uyghur language kindergarten.

64
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, it's because of I'm going\h
to have a kindergarten in Ürümqi.\h\h

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
I had my kindergarten in Kashgar.

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,760
Did they, did they charge you with anything?\h\h

67
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,840
I can't imagine them charging you\h
with trying to run a kindergarten.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
First of all, they charged me as a separate\h
test and then charge me as a, like a\h\h

69
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,840
CIA agent and then. Oh yeah, I forgot\h
that, and then the religious extremist,\h\h

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:07:00,000
because of I asked the food, it is halal or not,\h
just 1 question. It's not it's halal or not.\h\h

71
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:09,440
And then like charge me as a extremist, but\h
that then. I haven't accepted any accusation,\h\h

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:20,000
and at the end, they charged me economic crime. It\h
means that illegal fundraising for kindergarten.

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
How did you get through it?

74
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, because of my (silence) my strongness,\h
I will not admit anything. I wouldn't admit\h\h

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,160
anything. I wouldn't admit any crime. I wouldn't\h
accept any accusation. I said I'm innocent.\h\h

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,720
Actually, I'm innocent, and like they\h
interrogated me 6 months and torture me 6 months.\h\h

77
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,080
And as I told you, first 3 months, it's\h
horrible. It's really bad. But after 3 months,\h\h

78
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:08,640
I get your strick that electric and electricizing\h
or like torching or hanging me up or beating and\h\h

79
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:19,600
like get your strick. And I try to keep my stance.\h
I keep my, I try to keep my dignity, and it works\h\h

80
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,680
at the end. Like yes, I'm the one I will never\h
obey. I will never say yes, I will never admit.

81
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,120
How do you get used to something like that?

82
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:44,160
You have to because, in that circumstances,\h
there's 2 ways. One, keep your dignity and keep\h\h

83
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,800
your stance; another is follow the instruction.\h
If I follow the instruction, I know what will\h\h

84
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,520
happen. It's life in prison. And it's like\h
a terrorism or extremism or separatism. Man,\h\h

85
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:07,440
because of I admitted that because of I supported\h
by a 4th Foundation, Chinese Government accused\h\h

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
me as a, like a CIA agent. If I accept that,\h
yes, I have done this, and I need to say more,\h\h

87
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
and I need to create something. I need to\h
make up something, what they have done.\h\h

88
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,320
And if I say yes to a accusation of\h
separatism, I will say something more.\h\h

89
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,760
And if I say like, say yes for a religious\h
extremism, I will say that I will say,\h\h

90
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,280
do something more. I just, during the\h
interrogation, I said that I gave lecture\h\h

91
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:52,400
more than 2000 students and they will upset\h
and they will not happy for this interrogation.

92
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,360
If they know this, I'm think\h
write it down that (silence)\h\h

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:07,520
optimally created, train it 2000 terrorist, and\h
then the next day it came to me that you said you\h\h

94
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,040
trained the 2000 terrorists? No, I never said\h
that. I said I gave lecture to 2000 students.\h\h

95
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,200
What you said that? No. I haven't\h
let me to sign under the, under the,\h\h

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,680
under the paper. I said no, because I said\h
students, not terrorist. I haven't trained\h\h

97
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,920
anything, anyone to do something. I just gave a\h
lecture. I just gave a lecture to them. Look, if\h\h

98
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,160
I signed, but at the bottom, that yes. Yeah, that\h
will be ending. And then I will be the terrorist.

99
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah. It just, it, to me, it sums up the\h
communist party perfectly. They, they\h\h

100
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,760
try to start a kindergarten. They put you in\h
a concentration camp. So you've been trying to\h\h

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,560
raise awareness about the genocide of Uyghur's.\h
What do you think of the international response?

102
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,560
I think that first of all, we have\h
this recognition from US Government,\h\h

103
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,200
and the Canadian Parliament, and the Netherlands\h
Parliament. It's good. First of all, the,\h\h

104
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,880
the recognition is very important, and\h
second, we need international action,\h\h

105
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:29,760
and we need international support. I hope we\h
will have in the future, and the first of all,\h\h

106
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:38,240
this recognition, this genocide, this\h
recognition is important. And second, and if it\h\h

107
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:50,560
work, if it works, if it will like effect, it\h
depends on how are we honest and how are we\h\h

108
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,520
integrate and how are we take the real\h
action? It's that step I'm waiting for.

109
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Why do you think some people, some Governments\h
are resistant to calling it a genocide?

110
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,200
I think it's mainly because of a\h
money issue. It's a trade deal,\h\h

111
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,840
and China is the second largest economy in\h
the world, and the international supply chain\h\h

112
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,360
are working right now. And the China played an\h
important role in this international supply chain.\h\h

113
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,200
And the international businessmen door is national\h
company like Apple, like Nike. They don't want to\h\h

114
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,440
cut this international split\h
supply chain. But we cannot\h\h

115
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,760
ignore and the weak, like a for\h
example, that it's okay to their\h\h

116
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:59,360
shoes from some companies, and it's okay to\h
not to wear Nike shoes. But it's not okay to\h\h

117
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:10,400
ignore humanitarian tragedy happening\h
there; ignore genocide is commenting there.

118
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,040
Yeah. I think the issue is if you call, once\h
you say China is a country committing genocide,\h\h

119
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,040
you can't have international businesses doing\h
business with China. You can have the president\h\h

120
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,600
of the United States shaking hands with the\h
leader of a country committing genocide.

121
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes, of course. Like if we, for example, that\h
the US Government recognize Chinese Government,\h\h

122
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:48,240
they commit, committing genocide. And at the\h
end, shake hand with the like criminals it means\h\h

123
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,200
that it is a genocide. The Chinese Government is\h
committing the genocide. It means that they are\h\h

124
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:01,120
not the normal state and not the normal party.\h
They are group of criminals, and how do you shake\h\h

125
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
hand with the criminals and how do, how do you do\h
business with the criminals and how do you have a\h\h

126
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,560
normal diplomacy with the, with the criminals?\h
And we have like, criminal should be in prison,\h\h

127
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,320
should be in the court. Not, not should be in the\h
court, not be in the prison right now because it\h\h

128
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,960
has all of the criminal like genocide. If\h
you are discussing with the genocide. Yes,\h\h

129
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,520
it's okay with the debate, and the way the like\h
talk and with the, it's okay, but all that the\h\h

130
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:36,120
claim that this is a genocide and then talk about\h
business and something else. It's not honest.

131
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Yeah.

132
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
It's not integrity.

133
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,680
Yeah. Maybe Disney couldn't\h
film Mulan and Xinjiang,\h\h

134
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,640
and thank the Public security bureau there.\h
That's involved in the genocide of your people.

135
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,840
Yes, of course; first of all, Disney\h
shouldn't feel very close. Shouldn't feel\h\h

136
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,920
the place very close to concentration camp, a few\h
kilometers away. The second, they shouldn't thank\h\h

137
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,920
the, the Public security who are implementing\h
this genocide right now. And the third,\h\h

138
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,920
they should know what they are doing. They claim\h
openly that like thank Public security bureau or\h\h

139
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,080
something like that. It, it means that some\h
international company, they don't care. They\h\h

140
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,040
don't care our audience. They don't care their\h
customers. They don't respect their customers.

141
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,840
Yeah, and I can definitely say this episode\h
is non-sponsored by Disney+ or Nike.

142
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:41,840
Yeah.

143
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
And for anyone watching, who\h\h

144
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,000
wants to do something about this evil that's being\h
committed, what do you have a message for them?

145
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:01,120
We should know what we are eating. Is\h
it related to Chinese Forced Labor? We\h\h

146
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:10,720
should know what we are wearing. Is it related to\h
China Forced Labor? And then we spent our money.\h\h

147
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,560
Is it related to supply chain connected to\h
Chinese Forced Labor? Now, I can say that\h\h

148
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,080
it is a big economy and the Uyghur Forced Labor\h
is everywhere; not only in our hometown and every\h\h

149
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:39,280
Chinese provinces, we have Uyghur Forced Labor.\h
So, it's impossible to say that this, this product\h\h

150
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:46,960
related to forced labor; this product is not\h
actually all related together; they are connected.\h\h

151
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:55,360
So, we should think that what we are buying.\h
It means that we are feeding the Chinese\h\h

152
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,480
atrocity and we are supporting Chinese Government\h
committing suicide. So, we need to be aware of it.

153
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,000
A 100% agree. Thanks for joining us, and\h
thank you for keeping up this good fight.

154
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Thank you for having me, and thank\h
you for make Uyghur arranges.

155
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,920

156
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,480

Podcast. I’ll put a link to that below.

157
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,920
