1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,440
China has threatened to invade Taiwan.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Taiwan has been preparing.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,280
But is Taiwan ready?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,120
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,840
Taiwan. A thriving democracy\h
of 24 million people.\h

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,480
Home of the Freedom Pineapple.\h

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,360
And the hottest flashpoint of 2021!\h

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,560
For years, experts have called\h
Taiwan the likeliest flash point\h\h

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,480
that would trigger world war 3.\h

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,240
That’s because of the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s plan for Taiwan “unification”.\h\h

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
Which is just a nicer way of saying invasion.\h

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,840
But a Chinese Communist takeover of Taiwan\h
would also endanger the rest of the world.\h\h

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,480
Taiwan is part of the first island chain in the\h
Pacific, along with Japan and the Philippines.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,680
The Chinese Communist Party is already claiming\h
the bottom part of the first island chain,\h\h

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,640
with their nine-dash line in the South China Sea.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,480
If they got Taiwan, too, that would\h
consolidate their power over much of\h\h

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,600
Asia. And it would also be a launching point\h
for them to threaten the rest of the Pacific.

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,960
Including US allies like Japan, the Philippines,\h
and Australia. And US territories like Guam.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,480
Even Hawaii.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
That’s a big reason why the\h
Pentagon should focus on Taiwan.\h

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,160
But the US doesn’t have an official defense\h
treaty with Taiwan. That means if the Chinese\h\h

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,320
Communist Party actually invaded Taiwan, the\h
US isn’t required by law to defend Taiwan.\h

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,480
That doesn’t mean the US wouldn’t defend\h
Taiwan, it just means it’s not guaranteed.\h

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,640
However, the US is required by law “to provide\h
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character.”

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
Enough to “enable Taiwan to maintain\h
a sufficient self-defense capability.”

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,800
In 2020 alone, US arms sales to\h
Taiwan totaled 5 billion dollars.\h

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party\h
has warned the Biden administration\h\h

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,040
to stop doing this. Or doing\h
anything to support Taiwan.\h

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
But other than throwing hissy fits at the US,\h\h

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,800
the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t have a lot\h
of options for how it can take over Taiwan.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,280
It could move decisively to a full-scale\h
invasion to raise the cost of US intervention.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
It’s possible that the Biden\h
administration would then decide\h\h

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,240
it’s not worth sending US\h
troops to defend Taiwan.\h

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,560
This is a risky move, though.\h
We’ve talked before about how\h\h

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
difficult it would be to launch\h
a full-scale invasion of Taiwan.

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
The Chinese regime could also\h
adopt a coercive strategy\h\h

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
that gradually increases military pressure\h
to bend Taipei to China’s demands.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,680
This idea of gradual escalation is what\h
many people call gray zone warfare.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
We did an episode about how the\h
Chinese regime is using gray\h\h

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,840
zone warfare against Taiwan by constantly\h
sending warplanes into Taiwan’s airspace.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,960
This can ensure that China always maintains the\h
initiative, keeping Taiwan on edge constantly,\h\h

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,640
without going into full-scale conflict.
\h\h

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,880
This “war of attrition” is\h
already wearing down Taiwan\h\h

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,240
politically, militarily, and psychologically.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,720
The Chinese Communist Party is trying to\h
make their aggression and militarization\h\h

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,240
the norm, “something that is not worthy of\h
any sort of response from other nations.”

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,080
So if other countries won’t respond to\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s actions,\h\h

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,840
is Taiwan’s military prepared\h
for a Chinese invasion?

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,200
I’ll get to that after the break.

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,400
Welcome back.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
So is Taiwan’s military prepared for an invasion?\h

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,600
Taiwan has its eyes on increasing\h
its conventional weapon capabilities,\h\h

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,000
but many experts say that Taiwan\h
should stop spending its money on them.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,400
That’s because those systems are\h
expensive and not necessarily useful\h\h

57
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,480
for the type of warfare that Taiwan\h
would face from the Communist Party.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
This is why, a couple of years\h
ago, former Taiwanese Admiral\h\h

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,960
Lee Hsi-ming proposed what’s called the\h
Overall Defense Concept, or ODC for short.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,120
“The ODC is Taiwan’s current strategy for dealing\h\h

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
with a potential Chinese invasion in\h
a resource-constrained environment.”

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Instead of a traditional war of attrition, the ODC\h\h

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,240
redefines winning war against China\h
as “foiling the People’s Liberation\h\h

64
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Army’s mission of successfully invading and\h
exerting political control over Taiwan.”

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
Admiral Lee says Taiwan should prepare to absorb\h\h

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
missile and air strikes and\h
preserve the ability to strike back.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,480
The ability to strike back would rely\h
on an abundance of small, cheap weapons\h\h

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,040
like mobile anti-ship missiles,\h
portable anti-aircraft missiles,\h\h

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,840
advanced sea mines and fast missile boats.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,360
What’s great about these weapons is that they\h
can be camouflaged and dispersed in urban,\h\h

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,640
coastal, jungle and mountain areas.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,840
This makes it hard for the\h
PLA to search and destroy.

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,280
The ODC is an approach that Taiwanese\h
President Tsai Ing-wen supports.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,000
There are, however, some bureaucratic challenges\h
that Taiwan faces in implementing the ODC.

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,000
“Efforts at defense reform face obstacles\h
from institutional opposition from senior\h\h

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
officers and a lack of time.”

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
On top of that, there’s also the\h
issue of Taiwan’s military readiness.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
“Taiwan is suffering a serious and\h
worsening decay in the readiness\h\h

79
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,040
and training of its troops,\h
particularly its army units.”

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,560
Much of it is because Taiwan’s\h
mandatory military service\h\h

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
has dramatically decreased\h
from one year to four months.

82
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
But even within those four months,\h\h

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,200
some army conscripts say that they only fire 30\h
to 40 rounds with their rifles. That’s not a lot.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
One army conscript said that he wasn’t even\h
taught how to clear his rifle if it jammed.

85
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,160
Not even a fraction of conscripts\h\h

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
get the chance to practice shooting\h
anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers.

87
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,040
So, they miss all the fun parts.

88
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,160
This is a problem because a military is\h
only as good as its soldiers. What good\h\h

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,720
is buying weapons if your soldiers\h
aren’t trained to use them properly?

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,080
The Tsai administration is trying to correct\h
these issues with a mobilization office.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,560
Its goal is to better strengthen\h
and coordinate Taiwan’s reserve\h\h

92
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,800
forces so that reserve soldiers play a greater\h
role and support active-duty service members.

93
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
The administration will also\h
extend post-service training\h\h

94
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
for reservists from 8 years to 15 years in 2022.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,920
But are these reforms enough?

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
I’ll get to that after the break.

97
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Welcome back.

98
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Taiwan’s a democracy, and as a democracy,\h
you don’t want to upset people — especially\h\h

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,800
young voters — with something like\h
mandatory military conscription.

100
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,440
But you know what’s easy to do? Rely\h
on America. But like I said earlier in\h\h

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
this episode, there’s no guarantee\h
that America will come through.\h

102
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,120
Although if it doesn’t, that would be a huge blow\h
to America’s standing in the world, not to mention\h\h

103
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,000
our ability to counter the Chinese Communist\h
Party. But that’s a whole nother episode.\h

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,360
The biggest problem for Taiwan, is that\h
relying on the US might be making Taiwan soft.

105
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Retired US Marine Corp colonel Grant Newsham says\h
that Taiwan’s military has been whittled down\h\h

106
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,240
because it is acting as if defending the\h
country is someone else’s responsibility.

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
There is also a concern\h\h

108
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,680
the Taiwanese might not have the will to\h
defend against and resist the mainland.

109
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,440
This is a problem because, “as the president\h
of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council puts it,\h\h

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,840
the problem of Taiwan's defense comes down to\h
‘the space between how young Taiwan citizens\h\h

111
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,840
feel about the island's sovereignty and\h
what they're prepared to do about it.’”

112
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,680
So how do they feel?

113
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Polls show mixed messages. According to one\h
poll, “If war were to break out between Taiwan\h\h

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,440
and China, 40.9 percent of those surveyed said\h
that they are willing to fight or would not\h\h

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,600
object to their family's participation,\h
while 49.1 percent said the opposite.”

116
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
So the majority of Taiwanese are not willing\h
to fight against the Chinese regime.\h

117
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,360
But another poll shows that 96 percent of 18\h
and 19-year-olds would be willing to fight.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,280
Although that percentage dropped to 26 percent\h\h

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,560
for people in their 20s. The age that would\h
likely be sent first to the front lines.\h

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,960
But public sentiment in Taiwan is likely\h
to change as the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,880
gets more aggressive. Hong Kong has already\h
been a huge wake-up call to many Taiwanese.\h

122
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,320
When faced with an existential\h
crisis, a smaller force like Taiwan\h\h

123
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,680
can beat a much larger foe like\h
China if it has enough resolve.

124
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,880
And Taiwan’s government is proactively\h
trying to solve their military weaknesses.\h\h

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
They just need enough time.\h

126
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,880
So let’s hope that this retired Japanese general\h
is wrong and China doesn’t invade Taiwan by 2025.

127
