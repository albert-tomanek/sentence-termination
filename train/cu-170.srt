1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,460
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,610
Terracotta Warriors are vandalized.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,940
I’m giving that a thumbs down.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,050
I know what I don’t want at my funeral.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,910
And finally, Chinese prisons love fashion...

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,800
manufacturing jobs.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,560
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,010
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,939
You’ve probably seen photos of these guys:

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,699
The Terracotta Warriors.

12
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,840
They survived in an underground tomb

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
for 2,000 years.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Ten of them were on loan

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
to a museum in Philadelphia.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
And this week,

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
some idiot American snapped off

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
one of their fingers for a souvenir.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Ten of them were on loan

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
to a museum in Philadelphia.

21
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
And this week,

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
some idiot American snapped off

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
one of their fingers for a souvenir.

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,820
He was attending an “ugly sweater party”

25
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,920
at the museum,

26
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,350
when he snuck into the Terracotta Warriors
exhibit.

27
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,550
That’s not a joke,

28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,680
that’s what he was actually doing.

29
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,890
It was almost the perfect crime.

30
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,949
If only he hadn’t left

31
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,210
his fingerprints on the statue.

32
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,719
And if only there weren’t surveillance footage.

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,300
And if only hadn’t sent photos

34
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,460
of the thumb he stole

35
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,200
to friends on SnapChat.

36
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,530
The man was arrested by the FBI

37
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,930
and is now out on bail.

38
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,170
He faces a 10 year prison sentence

39
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,680
for defacing the 4.5 million dollar statue.

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,140
On the bright side,

41
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,840
for the few days he had that thumb,

42
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,950
boy...he was a master hitchhiker.

43
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,790
The Terracotta Warriors exhibit will be open

44
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,590
until early March.

45
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,180
Critics give it one thumb up,

46
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,080
and one thumb off.

47
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,300
Now, even more outrage!

48
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,310
This time from me.

49
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,100
They’re cracking down on funeral strippers.

50
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,030
Apparently, in some rural communities,

51
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,180
it’s believe that the more people

52
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,810
that attend a funeral,

53
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,030
the more honor for the deceased.

54
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,770
How do you get more people?

55
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,460
Well, traditionally people hired

56
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,250
Chinese opera singers to draw a crowd.

57
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,530
But this is modern China.

58
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,920
So now the answer is obviously, strippers.

59
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,530
According to the Global Times,

60
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,670
China’s Ministry of Culture has set up,

61
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,700
“a special ‘hotline’ for the public

62
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,450
to report any ‘funeral misdeeds’”.

63
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,430
And you know what, in this instance,

64
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,280
I have complete faith that local CCP authorities

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,730
will quickly, and personally,

66
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,600
get to the bottom of this issue.

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,580
Moving on to international news.

68
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,000
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte:

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,090
The man who once vowed

70
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,940
to personally ride a jet ski

71
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,030
to plant a Filipino flag on Chinese-occupied
islands

72
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,110
in the South China Sea.

73
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,750
But that was two years ago,

74
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,040
and boy have things changed!

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Earlier this week,

76
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,640
President Duterte made waves

77
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,310
when he joked that the Philippines

78
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,510
should become a province of China.

79
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,530
It was part of his speech

80
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,900
at the Chinese Filipino Business Club.

81
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,240
“If you want, you (China) should just

82
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,160
make us your province.

83
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,340
Like Fujian.

84
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,010
Call it the Philippine province of China.”

85
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,420
He went on to add,

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
and once again, I'm not joking:

87
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,860
“If China were a woman,

88
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,890
I’d woo her.”

89
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,959
And really, what woman wouldn’t want

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,830
to be wooed by Duterte?

91
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,680
Am I right, ladies?

92
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,250
Duterte then brought up the controversial

93
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,090
military installations that China

94
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,750
is building in the South China Sea.

95
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,300
He told people to relax;

96
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,040
those have nothing to do with the Philippines.

97
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,320
“It’s really intended against those

98
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,880
who the Chinese think would destroy them—

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,440
and that is America.

100
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,640
We are not a part of that.”

101
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,180
Haha, yes, clap for that.

102
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,180
And the Financial Times

103
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,940
has interviewed Peter Humphrey,

104
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,460
who spent 23 months in a Chinese prison.

105
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,290
Humphrey used to be a British Private Investigator.

106
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,540
But he was jailed in 2014

107
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,440
and kept in a small cage.

108
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,030
And that’s where he learned all about fashion!

109
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,849
I mean just look at this little ensemble he
wore

110
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,430
to his mandatory state-run TV confession.

111
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,560
According to Humphrey,

112
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,320
“The prison was a business,

113
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,720
doing manufacturing jobs for companies.

114
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Mornings, afternoons and often

115
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,990
during the after-lunch nap,

116
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,450
prisoners ‘laboured’ in the common room.”

117
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,700
Humphrey said that what they made

118
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,870
included packaging for fashion retailers

119
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,680
H&M and C&A.

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,599
Nothing’s more fashionable than slave labor!

121
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,870
Of course, both H&M and C&A

122
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,659
say in their supplier code and conduct agreements

123
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,889
that prison labor is not okay.

124
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,889


125
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,889
And of course the companies

126
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,590
are investigating the matter now.

127
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,270
But maybe they should have been wondering

128
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,180
why it’s so cheap to get things made in
China.

129
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
So what do you think?

130
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,349
Leave your comments below.

131
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,500
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

132
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,969
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

133
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,080
see you next time.

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,980
Well the Chinese Communist Party

135
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,300
is certainly rotten.

136
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,990
But you know what never goes bad?

137
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,710
Food from Thrive Life.

138
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,590

139
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,169

China Uncensored gets a cut.

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,069
I wouldn’t ask you to eat their food

144
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,620
if I didn’t also personally love it.

145
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,419
So support your belly and China Uncensored

146
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,710
