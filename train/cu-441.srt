1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,320
No end in sight for the trade war

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,430
Human rights become America’s secret weapon

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,960
And China makes threats to well, everyone!

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,280
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,440
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,870
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,880
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,530
The US-China Trade War looks like it’s going
to be a long one.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,570
Earlier this week,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,100
President Trump announced new tariffs on China.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,480
And the Chinese regime responded by devaluing
its currency.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,469
So the US Treasury Department declared China
a currency manipulator.

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,589
Which we all pretty much knew they were for
years,

14
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,570
but hey, now it’s official.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,399
And then the Chinese Communist Party responded

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,269
by calling the currency manipulator label
totally wrong.

17
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,879
Which proves something I’ve believed for
a long time—

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,870
the Communist Party honestly doesn’t know
what wrong means.

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,230
It explains so much.

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,210
Chinese companies have also been ordered

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,909
to stop buying US agricultural products.

22
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,350
According to a trade advocacy group,

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,000
Trump’s tariffs have cost US businesses
$3.4 billion dollars.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,410
But according to US Treasury data,

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,590
over the past 12 months,

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,580
the US government has collected $63 billion
dollars in tariffs.

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,870
About half of that is due to the increased
tariffs on Chinese goods.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,500
Meanwhile, a lot of Chinese companies are
struggling.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,940
They’ve have resorted to issuing

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,600
more than $200 billion dollars in I.O.U.s.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,150
Wait...Where have I seen that before?

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,710
“What is this?

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,271
What is this?

34
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,271
Where’s all the money?”

35
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,271
“That’s as good as money, sir.

36
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,810
Those are I.O.U.s.”

37
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,210
Brilliant.

38
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,760
The Trump administration is going nuclear
on human rights.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,420
This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
said,

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,580
“China is home to one of the worst human
rights crises of our time.

41
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,790
It is truly the stain of the century.”

42
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,190
And I thought my roommate’s old couch had
the stain of the century.

43
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,840
Vice President Mike Pence said the US is also
considering

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,750
punishing Chinese officials for human rights
abuses.

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,920
“Vice President Mike Pence has signaled
that the Trump administration

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,140
is open to using the Global Magnitsky Act

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,150
to sanction top officials in Xinjiang, China.”

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,780
The Global Magnitsky Act is basically targeted
sanctions.

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,770
Rather than hitting an entire country,

50
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,999
it targets specific officials involved in
crimes.

51
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,230
It prevents them from traveling to the US,

52
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,850
seizes any property they own in the US,

53
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,249
and punishes companies and banks for doing
business with them.

54
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:26,670
It basically cuts these officials off from
the high end lifestyle

55
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,360
they typically enjoy in the Western world.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,099
No more sipping Espresso Martinis in Miami.

57
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,530
Tragic.

58
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,569
Pence also met with representatives

59
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,249
of religious groups persecuted in China,

60
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,299
including Christian, Uighur Muslim,

61
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,269
and Falun Gong representatives.

62
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:44,989
In response, the Chinse Communist Party

63
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,909
couldn’t decide whether to condemn the meeting

64
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,299
or just pretend the persecuted groups didn’t
exist.

65
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:51,739
Tough choices.

66
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,090
And late last week,

67
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,920
a Uighur man was detained in Qatar.

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,829
They were going to deport him back to China.

69
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,920
So he made an impassioned plea over social
media.

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,999
“I need the world's help”

71
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,359
And after his story spread on social media,

72
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,019
he was put on a plane...

73
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,190
to the United States.

74
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,989
Yes, the US State Department rescued a Muslim
refugee.

75
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,590
And confused a lot of Americans.

76
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,219
But if human rights aren’t enough of a weapon

77
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,940
against the Chinese Communist Party,

78
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,069
there’s always actual weapons.

79
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,450
The US has withdrawn from the INF treaty.

80
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,989
That’s the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty.

81
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,379
The reason, the State Department says,

82
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:30,700
is “the Russian Federation’s continuing
violation of the treaty.”

83
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Another reason is China.

84
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
According to the treaty,

85
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,620
the US couldn’t flight test or posses

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,700
intermediate-range ground launched missiles.

87
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,810
China never signed on to the INF treaty.

88
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,849
And guess what China has been building?

89
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,019
Now that the US is out of the INF treaty,

90
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,340
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said the
US plans to deploy

91
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,519
non-nuclear INF-range missiles in Asia,

92
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,980
“sooner rather than later.”

93
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,709
The Chinese Communist Party...is not pleased.

94
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,319
And has warned it will “not stand idly by.”

95
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,689
Which is fantastic!

96
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,099
The CIA already said a year ago we’re in
Cold War 2

97
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,349
And now we have a right proper arms race going
on!

98
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,890
You know what that means!

99
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,950
James Bond movies will be good again!

100
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,099
The real question is,

101
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,560
will she be a trigger-happy womanizer like
the previous 007s?

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,950
But it’s not just US missiles China has
to worry about.

103
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,889
Taiwan is developing a new supersonic cruise
missile.

104
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,310
But from a certain point of view,

105
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,610
doesn’t that really just mean China is developing

106
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,520
a new supersonic cruise missile?

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,400
What’s that Shelley?

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,580
No?

109
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,770
Ok.

110
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,960
Taiwan is reportedly building 20 of the Yun
Feng missiles

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,020
as well as 10 truck-based launchers.

112
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,280
This would give Taiwan the ability to hit

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,419
many of the Chinese military bases

114
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,610
that would potentially be involved in an assault
on the island nation.

115
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,090
And even NATO is getting involved.

116
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,240
The Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg,

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,150
says NATO needs to address quote,

118
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,440
“the rise of China.”

119
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,030
Specifically how China is,

120
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,900
“Investing heavily in critical infrastructure
in Europe,

121
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,470
[its] increased presence in the Arctic

122
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,490
and also increased presence in Africa,

123
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,500
and in cyberspace.”

124
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,090
Of course, the real question is whether NATO

125
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,850
will *actually* do anything.

126
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,759
Meanwhile, China is threatening India.

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,120
In a few months,

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,699
India will be starting trials for 5G systems
in the country.

129
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,490
But the Indian government has yet to make
it clear

130
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,020
whether or not they’ll let the Chinese telecom
company Huawei join.

131
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,510
Countries around the world have been joining

132
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,819
the United States’ call to ban Huawei over
national security concerns.

133
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,099
But it’s a good thing the Communist Party
is so good at diplomacy.

134
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,600
They know just how to soothe any fears India
may have.

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
With threats!

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,390
Chinese officials told the Indian ambassador
in Beijing

137
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,830
that “there could be ‘reverse sanctions’
on Indian firms

138
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,009
engaged in business in China should India
block Huawei.”

139
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,849
In other words, if India bans Huawei,

140
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,449
China will make Indian private businesses
operating in China suffer.

141
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,889
Hopefully those companies then will pressure
the Indian government

142
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,810
to put their short-term profits ahead of national
security.

143
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,840
So clearly, things aren’t going well for
China.

144
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,320
And now, even New Zealand is even getting
upset.

145
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,539
The Chinese consulate in Auckland

146
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,009
praised a group of Chinese students at a New
Zealand university f

147
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,759
or a demonstration of “spontaneous patriotism.”

148
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,020
See, students had put up a Lennon Wall

149
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,220
at the University of Auckland

150
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,240
to support Hong Kong protesters.

151
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,889
Of course, the Chinese consulate wasn’t
referring to

152
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,110
the people who put up the Lennon Wall as “patriots.”

153
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,060
It was *these* guys who were the “patriots.”

154
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,000
Hong Kong is different from China.

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Hong Kong is a part of China.

156
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,430
If you don’t like China, get out of China.

157
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,210
Hey hey hey

158
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,550
Hong Kong is a part of China, I tell you that.

159
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,550
Hey, you are not human.

160
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,550
F—ing stupid pig.

161
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,000
Back off!

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,530
Stop Fighting!

163
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,800
Security.

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,700
I’m...pretty sure she fell on purpose.

165
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,789
But it made international news, so good on
her.

166
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,389
Of course, that didn’t stop mainland Chinese
students

167
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,110
from allegedly wrecking the Lennon Wall.

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,250
The good news is, the New Zealand government

169
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,659
“has rebuked China over its recent comments

170
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,330
and actions where it sought to suppress freedom
of speech

171
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,860
and voiced support for violent opposition

172
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,330
to Hong Kong protesters in New Zealand.”

173
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,630
Meanwhile in the Land Down Under, a Chinese
student—

174
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,919
clearly *not* a patriot—

175
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,110
joined a local protest in support of Hong
Kong protesters.

176
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,659
A few days later,

177
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:31,069
Chinese officials visited his parents in China.

178
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,889
And they warned them not to let the student

179
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,330
participate in any more protests.

180
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,380
So that his family could stay safe.

181
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,220
Also, his parents had to assure the officials

182
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,259
that their son was loyal to the Communist
Party.

183
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,789
Which proves again that Chinese Communist
Party influence

184
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,039
in liberal democracies is nothing to worry
about!

185
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,499
Oh, and then masked men destroyed a Lennon
Wall

186
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,949
at another university in Australia.

187
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,620
And with the destruction of that Lennon wall,

188
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,979
the Hong Kong protesters have been defeated.

189
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,469
Right.

190
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:02,590
By the way, school is starting soon.

191
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,979
And if you’re a university student,

192
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,379
why not set up your own Lennon Wall?

193
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,169
Be sure to take lots of pictures and video

194
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,710
of what happens and send it to me

195
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,729
on the China Uncensored facebook page,

196
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,620
or my twitter account, @chinauncensored.

197
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,660
And showing that the Communist Party is really
losing its grip,

198
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,730
it has banned Chinese movies and actors

199
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,100
from going to one of the biggest movie award
ceremonies in Asia—

200
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,069
because it’s in Taiwan.

201
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,590
And thus Taiwan fell,

202
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,150
and became a part of Mainland China once again.

203
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,959
Wow, such good strategies the Communist Party
comes up with.

204
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,289
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

205
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,329
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

206
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,039
a fan who support China Uncensored

207
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,760
with a dollar or more per episode,

208
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,899
by contributing through Patreon.

209
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,000
Largezo asks,

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,710
“Do you think that the PRC will conduct
a military intervention

211
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,860
in Hong Kong in the near future?”

212
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,269
Well, that is the question everyone is asking.

213
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,230
Certainly the Chinese Communist Party has
been hinting about that.

214
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,500
And let’s not forget the PLA garrison in
Hong Kong

215
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,670
making videos showing them fighting unarmed
protesters.

216
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,360
But currently top Communist leaders

217
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,950
are at the annual Beidaihe meeting

218
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
And guess what?!

219
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,120
“Jiang Zemin, the 92-year-old former president

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,829
and a heavyweight among party elders,

221
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:19,910
is expected to attend the conclave this year.”

222
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,389
And if you’ve been watching the show,

223
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,690
you know Jiang Zemin is behind a faction

224
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,480
trying to undermine Xi Jinping.

225
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,980
And I’m sure he’d love for things go Tiananmen
in Hong Kong.

226
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,040
Because that would be very bad for Xi Jinping.

227
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,850
But probably nothing concrete will happen
until that meeting wraps.

228
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,230
And secretive Party meetings are so secretive

229
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,560
so who knows what will come out of it.

230
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,220
Thanks for your question.

231
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,620
And thanks to everyone watching!

232
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,180
We could not make this show without your support.

233
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,480
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

234
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
or just watching and sharing the show

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,639
with your friends and family.

236
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,670
So thank you from me

237
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,930
and everyone on the China Uncensored team.

238
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,080
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

239
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,380
see you next time.
