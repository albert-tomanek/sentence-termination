1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,020
You are being watched.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,280
The Chinese government has a secret system,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,900
a machine that spies on you every hour of
every day.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,940
They designed it to monitor subversion,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Which could pretty much mean anything.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,600
Winnie-the-Pooh GIFs posted by ordinary housewives,

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,120
shopping sprees most people thought were “irrelevant.”

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,200
Hunted by the authorities,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,769
You will never escape.

10
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,060
Good guy or criminal,

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,110
If your number’s low,

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,560
they’ll find you.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,320
And I know who you are, too.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,600
Just kidding.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,960
Only a tyrant would monitor everything you
do online.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,720
Or possibly your mother.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,920
Hi mom!

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,510
Speaking of online monitoring,

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,150
I’m sure by now many of you have heard about

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,370
China’s social credit system.

23
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,859
China’s State Council released an outline

24
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:09,409
for a social credit system back in 2014.

25
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,719
Officials say it will “allow the trustworthy
to roam

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,310
everywhere under heaven while making it hard

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,960
for the discredited to take a single step.”

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,280
That sounds like some high-concept science
fiction show

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,470
disguised as a crime procedural on CBS.

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,380
But it’s actually something happening in
China right now.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,710
The idea is that 1.4 billion people

32
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,200
will be monitored and given a score—

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,819
determined by everything from credit history,

34
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,370
to behavioral habits,

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,659
to even the social media behavior of their
friends and family.

36
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,170
Which is horrifying.

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,369
Imagine if your social credit score depended
on

38
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,759
what your Uncle Ron does on the internet.

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,079
For the last time Uncle Ron,

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,380
there are no princes in Nigeria!

41
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,999
So how would such a social credit score work?

42
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:02,310
Well, in one city in Shandong province,

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,700
residents were assigned a thousand points
each.

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,509
And if you “Get a traffic ticket;

45
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,950
you lose five points.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,619
Earn a city-level award,

47
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,110
such as for committing a heroic act...

48
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,840
your score gets boosted by 30 points.”

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,750
Remember, standing up for human rights

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,769
is not a heroic act.

51
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,459
That’s subversion of state power.

52
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,659
Which is minus infinity points.

53
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,140
Here’s another example of how

54
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,250
a social credit system could work.

55
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,650
There’s something called Sesame Credit.

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,819
It’s run by Ant Financial, a subsidiary
of Jack Ma’s Alibaba.

57
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,599
Ant Financial’s technology director told
Wired

58
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,000
that even activities like playing too many
videos games

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,240
or buying diapers can affect your score.

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,320
“Someone who plays video games for ten hours
a day,

61
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,720
for example, would be considered an idle person...

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,530
Someone who frequently buys diapers would
be considered

63
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,280
as probably a parent, who on balance is more
likely to have

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,480
a sense of responsibility.”

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
That is so wrong.

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,320
Doesn’t he know any serious gamer

67
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,370
is probably also buying diapers

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,000
so they don’t have to interrupt their gaming

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,060
with bathroom breaks?

70
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,540
What’s the point of having a high Sesame
Credit score?

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,770
It can mean perks like “booking a rental
car

72
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,799
or a hotel room without making a deposit,

73
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,959
taking out loans at lower interest rates,

74
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,049
being shipped online purchases to try out

75
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,730
before paying for them,

76
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,390
and obtaining visas to Luxembourg and Singapore

77
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,870
through an expedited process.”

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,019
Sounds pretty sweet.

79
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,819
But what happens if you have a low social
credit score?

80
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,150
“If your score gets too low,

81
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,469
you can be banned from buying plane tickets,

82
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:44,560
renting a house, or getting a loan.”

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,379
This all sounds pretty scary.

84
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,440
And I thought Facebook was scary!

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,269
“Facebook gathers a huge amount of information

86
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,640
about its 1.4 billion daily users—

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
things like age, gender, relationship status,

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,950
what kind of groceries you buy,

89
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,860
even the square footage of your home.”

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,019
Wow, Facebook is scary.

91
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,510
And also, top-notch reporting from that guy.

92
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,040
But China also has 1.4 billion users—

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,650
or as they’re sometimes known, citizens.

94
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,090
And the Chinese regime wants to collect data
on them

95
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,769
for a different reason.

96
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,239
“The government here is saying it is trying
to purify society

97
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,650
by rewarding those who are trustworthy

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,360
and punishing those who are not.”

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,639
“China planning to go full big brother in
2020.”

100
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,070
It’s like the Chinese Communist Party wants
to

101
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,979
out-Orwell George Orwell.

102
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,350
But here’s the thing:

103
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,320
The Communist Party doesn’t need a social
credit score

104
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,130
to monitor citizens’ every move.

105
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,180
For example,

106
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,090
they can just check your social media activity
on WeChat.

107
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,100
Or the vast array of security cameras everywhere.

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,430
“Chinese technology firms, like Sense Time

109
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,050
are helping the government effort,

110
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,960
by developing advanced cameras that use

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,199
artificial intelligence to track just about
everything.”

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,720
In some parts of China,

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,710
authorities collect even really,

114
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,860
really personal information.

115
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,199
And as for punishing people for Thoughtcrime,

116
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,150
the Communist Party already has black jails.

117
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,720
Where they torture human rights lawyers just
to be ironic.

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,370
And if you practice the wrong religion,

119
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,370
watch out,

120
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,229
because military hospitals will kill you for
your organs

121
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,270
and sell them to rich people.

122
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,390
Which sounds like a high-concept science fiction
movie.

123
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,960
But is actually something that’s happening
in China right now.

124
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,949
So the reality is, the Chinese Communist Party

125
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,139
has plenty of very functional tools for repression.

126
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,900
All without a social credit system.

127
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,240
And that’s good—from their perspective,
at least—

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,120
because most of the reporting you see

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,080
about the social credit system

130
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
is great exaggerated or just flat out misleading.

131
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,930
According to Jeremy Daum,

132
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,840
an editor for the blog China Law Translate,

133
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,330
there are several common misconceptions,

134
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,060
such as “The system will be mandatory by
2020,”

135
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,000
“All Citizens will be given a ‘Citizen
Score,’”

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,800
or “Your score will dictate your place in
society.”

137
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,270
None of those is strictly accurate.

138
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,789
One scholar at Leiden University wrote a paper
called

139
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,979
“China’s Social Credit System: An Evolving
Practice of Control”

140
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,260
...to clarify what he also calls “major
factual mistakes.”

141
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,780
See, the Social Credit System is not one,

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,670
giant, unified and well-organized system.

143
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,490
It’s actually “an ecosystem of initiatives

144
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,389
at the central and local level,

145
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,440
operated by state and private actors.”

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
And we all know how messy and gross

147
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,520
Chinese ecosystems can be.

148
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,810
Not one, but eight private companies have
been

149
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,310
given permission by China’s State Council

150
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,060
to develop their own Social Credit Systems,

151
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,449
like Ant Financial’s Sesame Credit.

152
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,990
And one researcher says the social credit
system

153
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,690
may be more “about spurring consumerism

154
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,970
in a country where people have historically
s

155
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,669
aved more than they’ve spent.”

156
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,669
After all, Sesame Credit is all about companies

157
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,230
selling you stuff—

158
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,449
and what you buy affects your credit score.

159
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,300
Whereas on Sesame Street, the only sponsors

160
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,860
are the letter C and the number 7.

161
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,040
Although I do really want to buy some cookies
now...

162
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,979
Anyway, Sesame Credit is owned by parent company
Alibaba,

163
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,550
which is China’s biggest online commerce
company.

164
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,090
So maybe you make a nice luxury purchase on
Alibaba,

165
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,900
and your score goes up.

166
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,389
And then you get an easy visa to Luxembourg,

167
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,190
where you’ll of course,

168
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,509
“open up the Alipay app to find out about
local sights and shops,

169
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,250
as well as make payments using Alipay,

170
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,409
and potentially rack up a higher credit score
in the process.”

171
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,080
But that’s just one private company.

172
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,360
These private social credit systems are evolving
separately

173
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,800
from local government social credit score
initiatives.

174
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,120
And the local government initiatives

175
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
are also separate from each other.

176
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,389
I mentioned the city in Shandong

177
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,259
that gives you a thousand points,

178
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,520
and then adds or subtracts

179
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,400
based on your good or bad deeds.

180
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,750
I guess they’ve been reading a lot of Harry
Potter books.

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,139
10 points for Gryffindor!

182
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,500
But in other places,

183
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,970
the social credit system looks totally different.

184
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,319
In Shanghai, the local government created

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,820
their own app called Honest Shanghai.

186
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,460
“You sign up using your national ID number.

187
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,639
The app uses facial recognition software

188
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,000
to locate troves of your personal data

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,660
collected by the government,

190
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,909
and 24 hours later,

191
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,959
you're given one of three ‘public credit’
scores—

192
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,360
very good, good, or bad.”

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,850
And if you get “very bad,” your phone
explodes.

194
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,750
Now keep in mind, that app just draws from
government databases,

195
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,340
so it’s all info the government already
has on you.

196
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,160
And in another part of China,

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,350
Financial Times reporter Tom Hancock found
a village

198
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,270
where the system is...let’s call it,

199
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,240
your grandparent’s version of a smartphone
app.

200
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,700
That is, it’s handwritten notes on paper.

201
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,660
Villagers nominates each other for things
like

202
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,300
“‘filial piety’ ‘clean and tidy’
and ‘promotes wealth creation.’”

203
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,220
Kind of like your high school yearbook:

204
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,900
“Most likely to succeed,”

205
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,920
“class clown,”

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,170
and “most filial piety.”

207
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,370
“Villagers who do well in the vote get red
stars next to their name

208
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,660
and easier access to bank loans.”

209
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,560
I mean, at least in the low-tech system,

210
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,290
people get to vote.

211
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,771
In other parts of China, the social credit
systems

212
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:35,149
have a different goal in mind—

213
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,920
like dealing with a moral crisis in politics.

214
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,910
Basically there’s a growing perception t

215
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,579
hat the central government is weak

216
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,290
and local governments are corrupt.

217
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,110
I don’t know where people get that notion
from!

218
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,730
Anyway, the idea is that—to help fix this—

219
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,360
you can give local governments a rating.

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Of course, Chinese citizens are already allowed

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,360
to petition the government...

222
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,910
but that doesn’t always go so well.

223
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,740
I’m sure things will go better once they
can track

224
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,529
everyone who tries to petition.

225
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,500
What’s that, Shelley?

226
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,340
Oh right, they already do.

227
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,620
And despite all the problems I just mentioned

228
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,690
with these social credit systems...

229
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,390
there are more problems.

230
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,470
Like, what happens when there’s a mistake,

231
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,880
and you get assigned a low score by accident?

232
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,260
This Wall Street Journal articles talks about
a woman

233
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,750
who was fined for using her son’s subway
card,

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,820
because the algorithm couldn’t tell the
difference

235
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,680
between theft and borrowing her son’s card.

236
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,639
And then there’s basic security issues around
the fact

237
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,820
that they’re storing so much personal data
on millions of people.

238
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,640
In this exposé by Guangzhou’s Southern
Metropolis,

239
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,070
...two reporters found that for a few hundred
yuan,

240
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,610
they could easily gather personal information

241
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,639
on anyone in the country,

242
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,260
including where they are right this very second.

243
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,510
They could also get their “hotel booking
number,

244
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,600
ethnic group, date of birth, ID card number,

245
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,510
current residential address and hotel room
number.”

246
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,310
And for a little more money,

247
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,140
they could even find out who you shared that
hotel room with.

248
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,389
And for even more money,

249
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,000
they could find out about that time you binge-watched

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,260
all seven seasons Gilmore Girls in one weekend.

251
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,140
Hypothetically.

252
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,959
So how is is it possible that reporters—

253
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,380
or really anyone—

254
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,220
can get access to that supposedly secure data

255
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,139
for so many people?

256
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,430
“Either government and police insiders

257
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,430
are routinely selling access

258
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,430
to a treasure trove of personal information,

259
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,010
or that national databases are vulnerable
to outside hacking.”

260
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,959
But that’s beside the point.

261
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,190
The real point is,

262
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,980
in China...everyone can be Big Brother!

263
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,660
So you see, China isn’t becoming an Orwellian
nightmare.

264
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,970
It has been one for years!

265
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,850
So sit back, relax,

266
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,880
and buy more stuff using your smartphone.

267
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,209

283

It’s hard for a controversial show like
China Uncensored

284
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,610
to get advertisers,

285
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,480
and a lot of our YouTube videos get demonetized.

286
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,200
