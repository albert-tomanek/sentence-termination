1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,399
Don't worry!

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,399
Everything's fine!

3
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm just in a fairyland.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,469
Ughhh, dying.

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,130
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored I'm your host
Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,869
Okay, sorry, one second.

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,880
Help me Captain Planet!

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,070
Ah, much better.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,349
So a few days ago,

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,510
state-run Xinhua News asked on their Twitter
account if the city of Shenyang was experiencing

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,040
a fairyland or doomsday.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,380
Those things are easily confused, I know.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,730
You see, the pollution there was so bad,

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,400
they couldn't tell.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,210
And if you think it's just China's problem,
it's not.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,370
Like wealthy officials fleeing corruption
charges,

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,440
China's air pollution is also flying across
the Pacific and landing in America.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,909
In fact, nearly a third of San Francisco's
air pollution comes from China.

19
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,500
China's air pollution is bad--and it's probably
only going to get worse.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
But why am I telling you this?

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,530
Let me show you...

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,190
Here are 10 images to help you understand
China's doomsday air pollution.

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,030
Number 10.

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,090
This is downtown Beijing.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,060
The China Central Television Headquarters.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,189
Can't see anything?

27
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,249
This is what it looked like on a slightly
better day,

28
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:35,789
and this is what it's supposed to look like--after
the Communist Party ordered hundreds of factories

29
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:40,369
to close down to clear the skies ahead of
the 2008 Olympics.

30
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,319
That was temporary.

31
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,810
Number 9.

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,969
This was Beijing's air pollution two years
later, in November 2010.

33
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:55,749
That's after the US Embassy accidentally called
Beijing's pollution "crazy bad" on Twitter.

34
00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:00,720
Apparently that was a joke embedded in the
embassy's air monitoring program.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,859
If the level of PM 2.5 pollution went beyond
the most "hazardous" level of 500--

36
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,500
which was so outrageous it wasn't supposed
to ever happen--

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,370
it would Tweet "crazy bad."

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,489
Oops.

39
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:15,489
Number 8.

40
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,250
So you know how a pollution level of 500 is
hazardous,

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,640
and above that is crazy bad?

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,560
Well this was the northeastern city of Shenyang
on Sunday.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,310
It reached 1,400.

44
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,540
That's 50 times higher than what the World
Health Organization considers safe to breath.

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,570
And you really shouldn't be driving in this.

46
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,700
Number 7.

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,310
Would you want to eat food grown on this farm?

48
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,250
Some Chinese scientists have said air pollution
is so bad it's like a nuclear winter.

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,520
Because it's affecting plants' ability to
grow.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,990
Number 6.

51
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,400
Did you know that 9 out of every 10 Chinese
cities fail the government's own pollution

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
standards?

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,260
But, hey at least you can enjoy a beautiful
sunrise in Jilin.

54
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Number 5.

55
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,790
Part of the reason China's air is so bad is
they burn almost as much coal as the rest

56
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,090
of the world combined.

57
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,670
66 percent of China's energy comes from it.

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,340
But who knew coal could be so colorful?

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,030
Number 4.

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,920
You know how people say you can see the Great
Wall of China from space?

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,740
Well that's not true.

62
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,110
But you know what you can see from space?

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,180
Beijing's smog.

64
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,260
The gray part is the smog.

65
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,100
It's 600 miles across.

66
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,680
Number 3

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,140
There's an old Chinese saying:

68
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,690
"In the sky, there is heaven.

69
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,800
On earth, there is Hangzhou and Suzhou."

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,440
Well, this is Hangzhou.

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,770
Like I said, it was an old saying.

72
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,770
Number 2

73
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,300
Ah, the beautiful Saint Sophia Cathedral in
Harbin.

74
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,850
Illumined by an angelic halo... of smog.

75
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,450
And Number 1.

76
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,780
With pollution so bad, Chinese citizens are
taking things into their own hands.

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,400
Or faces.

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,410
Since you have to wear facemasks so often
thee days, why not be fashionable?

79
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,329
I wonder if I could get my own custom design?

80
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,729
Now I know this is all pretty scary.

81
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,530
But just relax, take a deep breath andâ€¦

82
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,530
on second though,

83
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,960
no, maybe don't do that.

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,509
So what do you think about the doomsday levels
of air pollution in China?
