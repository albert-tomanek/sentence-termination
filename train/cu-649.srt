00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:03,830
a rose by any other name,

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,109
would smell as sweet.

4
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,140
Unless you call the rose by its Tibetan name.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,180
Then it would smell like the inside of a prison
cell.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,960
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,780
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,100
When you think of the happiest place on Earth,

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,020
what do you think of?

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,300
Yes, Tibet.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,180
Why, its capital keeps ranking first

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,119
on Chinese state-run media’s list

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,920
of happiest cities in China.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,010
And surely a CCTV poll wouldn’t lie.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,010
After all,

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,030
that’s the closest thing to voting

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,120
that anyone in Lhasa might ever get.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,540
Let’s take a look at the details.

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,550
Wow!

20
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,480
Big data analysis reveals that

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
70% of Lhasa citizens

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,270
felt extremely happy in 2016.

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,650
And why wouldn’t they?

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,700
The Chinese Communist Party

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,379
has done great things in Tibet.

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,270
For instance, according to my favorite

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,789
Chinese state-run media The Global Times,

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,570
reincarnation is finally being well managed

29
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,800
by the government.

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,650
“Regulation gives government decisive rights

31
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,860
on reincarnation issue.”

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,380
What a thrill!

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,440
And who could forget how the loving message

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,909
of the Communist Party’s national congress

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,250
spreads across Tibet.

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,979
Through friendly soldiers and police—

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,619
there for everyone’s safety.

38
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,619
Wait a minute,

39
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,430
I think I know how they conducted

40
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,340
that happiness poll.

41
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,450
With such friendly soldiers and police

42
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,979
asking you questions,

43
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,900
of course you’d be extremely happy!

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,540
Yes, Tibet is the happiest place on Earth.

45
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,880
Minority rights for China’s ethnic Tibetans

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
are even guaranteed in the Chinese constitution!

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Particularly their right

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,390
to speak the Tibetan language.

49
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,760
It says,

50
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,549
“All nationalities have the freedom

51
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,119
to use and develop their own spoken

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,540
and written languages

53
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,310
and to preserve or reform

54
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,970
their own folkways and customs.”

55
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,290
So what happens when an ethnic Tibetan

56
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,049
tries to get Tibetan schools

57
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,140
to teach the Tibetan language?

58
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,889
He gets put on trial for inciting separatism,

59
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,040
a charge that carries a 15-year prison term.

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,249
And Chinese courts have a 99.9% conviction
rate.

61
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,510
So he was put on trial for doing something

62
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,510
that’s explicitly allowed

63
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,510
according to China’s constitution?

64
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,409
I know what you’re thinking.

65
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,859
How could the officially atheist government

66
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,689
that regulates reincarnation do anything so
hypocritical?

67
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,639
Well, it has to do with this documentary

68
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,049
the New York Times made about

69
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,590
Tashi Wangchuk two years ago.

70
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,719
Tashi observes that the Tibetan language

71
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,199
and culture are dying out,

72
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,650
largely because they’re not being

73
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,329
taught in schools.

74
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,199
So he develops a plan—

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,400
take Chinese law at face value.

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,480
According to the Chinese constitution,

77
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,980
a Chinese citizen has the right to sue any
official.

78
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,419
And officials have been blocking Tibetan schools

79
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,370
from teaching the Tibetan language,

80
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,519
something that violates China’s constitution.

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,739
So Tashi decides to go to Beijing

82
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,129
and use the Chinese legal system

83
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,430
to sue local officials for violating

84
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,120
the Constitution.

85
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,309
But we all know how the Chinese legal system

86
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,049
really works—or, rather,

87
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,589
doesn’t really work.

88
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,120
So big surprise—

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,209
he gets detained, tortured,

90
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,099
and then put on trial.

91
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,900
And the New York Times documentary

92
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,959
is used as evidence against him.

93
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,760
So just a little reminder to Tibetan dissidents:

94
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,930
Don’t talk about China’s problems

95
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,459
to Western media.

96
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,269
Or to Chinese officials.

97
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,809
Just don’t talk about problems at all.

98
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:45,540
That’s how you get to be the happiest city
in China.

99
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,650
So Tashi Wangchuk has now been detained

100
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,120
for two years.

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,290
He finally went on trial,

102
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,980
on January 4.

103
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
So in New York,

104
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,339
three activist groups organized a protest

105
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,170
outside the Chinese consulate.

106
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,340
“Actually, it’s a state set-up.

107
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,930
There’s no legal system.

108
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,939
And the fact that Tashi Wangchuk

109
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,799
actually said that he wanted to work

110
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,019
in the Chinese legal system

111
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,279
and ask for Tibetan rights,

112
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,709
and even then being turned into jail.

113
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,250
So legally it’s a state set up that

114
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,250
no matter what you do,

115
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,250
you end up in jail.”

116
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,440
“Why are Chinese authorities targeting Tashi?

117
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,129
I mean, if speaking Tibetan is subversive,

118
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,870
shouldn’t they just detain everyone?”

119
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,440
“So Tashi Wangchuk is a surprise for everyone,
that’s why.

120
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,389
Because he tried to fight a case

121
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,680
in the Chinese legal system.

122
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,479
And now he’s in prison.

123
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,500
So that means there’s no justice in China.”

124
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,199
“I think this trial right now that’s taking
place

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,830
is really exposing the true face

126
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,750
of China’s colonial ambitions.”

127
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,070
“Well that’s funny because

128
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,400
it’s China that’s always accusing the
West

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,780
of colonialism.”

130
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,810
“Yeah, I mean it’s been like

131
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,919
one of the oldest arguments ever used,

132
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,180
is whenever someone tries to say

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,530
the Tibetan people should be free.

134
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,530
They’ll be like,

135
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,530
‘What about the indigenous population,

136
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,530
what about the natives?’

137
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,270
And right now actually,

138
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,139
you see a lot of countries actually

139
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,259
trying to make amends,

140
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,090
they’re saying, ‘We apologize for this,

141
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,340
we want to make a difference,

142
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,259
and a lot of works still needs to be done.’

143
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,389
And the Chinese government,

144
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,580
they’re not even trying to get there.

145
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,040
They’re basically trying to wipe out Tibetan
language

146
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,080
and people who protect it,

147
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
like Tashi Wangchuk.”

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,130
“But what does China need to apologize for?

149
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,610
Tibetans are so happy.”

150
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,490
“Yeah, that’s definitely not true.

151
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,580
If Tibetans were so happy,

152
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,879
why do they not let China Uncensored into
Tibet?

153
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,410
Film the happiness, they won’t.”

154
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,740
“They’re using the New York Times documentary

155
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,060
as so-called evidence.

156
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,860
Do you think he could use the defense

157
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,310
that the New York Times is fake news?”

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
“I have no comment about that.

159
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,100
That’s a whole ’nother issue.”

160
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,229
“But international attention is growing.

161
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,600
And during Tashi’s trail recently on January 4

162
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,789
there were diplomats from five different embassies

163
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,980
traveling to Tibet for the first time.

164
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,630
And that’s something big,

165
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,449
and that’s why right now there is no conviction...

166
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,289
In fact it is not Tashi on trail right now.

167
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,360
It is the Chinese justice system.”

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,590
“Could you teach me a Tibetan phrase,

169
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,590
something useful.

170
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
How about:

171
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,639
“Help, I’m being detained by Chinese authorities”?

172
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
“Ngala gyami mangmi gi simsong, ngala rokpa
jhe-da.”

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
“How about just ‘help’?”

174
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,760
“Ngala rokpa godu.

175
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
We say ‘I need help.’

176
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,490
We don’t have one word.

177
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,800
We say ‘I need help.’

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Ngala rokpa godu.”

179
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,220
“Still too complicated.”

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,320
Well, if learning Tibetan is that hard,

181
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,600
I can’t imagine what it’s like when

182
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,939
the government is actively trying to stop
you.

183
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,939
And you know,

184
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,090
the crazy thing about Tashi Wangchuk

185
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,870
being tried for “inciting separatism”

186
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,340
is that he specifically told the New York
Times

187
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,270
he was not advocating for a free Tibet.

188
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,120
He wanted to sort out the issues

189
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,870
within China’s legal system,

190
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,920
by using the legal system.

191
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,840
Oh wait,

192
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,040
I see why that’s subversive.

193
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,300
So what do you think of Tashi Wangchuk’s
case?

194
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,939
Leave your comments below.

195
