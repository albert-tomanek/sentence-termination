1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,420
Guess which country is propping up the Venezuelan regime:

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,560
Is it A: Albania,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,820
B: Bulgaria,

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,880
or C: China?

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,300
The Chinese Communist Party wants to

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,060
build a better world.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,949
And they’re doing it through the One Belt,

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,440
One Road initiative—

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,210
as we know from Chinese state-run media.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,340
It’s also sometimes called the Silk Road
Initiative.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,060
Over the next 10 to 15 years,

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,450
China plans to invest $5 trillion dollars

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,370
on infrastructure projects around the world.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,890
Now sure, these investments often take

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,200
the form of loans to countries with,

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,680
shall we say questionable human rights.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,870
But it’s that kind of no-questions-asked
money lending

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,620
that’s going to make a difference.

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,870
Why, just look at China’s long time beneficiary—

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,100
Venezuela!

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,540
Or...maybe don’t.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,560
Well that doesn’t exactly look like

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,890
China built a better world in Venezuela.

25
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,500
Which is strange because they’ve been

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,350
long-time partners.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,850
In 2001,

28
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,390
Venezuela became the first Latin American
country

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,030
to enter a “strategic development partnership,”

30
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,430
with China.

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,080
In 2014 that got upgraded to

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,010
a “comprehensive strategic partnership.”

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,620
And Venezuela has been a big supporter

34
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,980
of China’s Silk Road Initiative.

35
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,040
Just last month,

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,880
an official called it fantastic,

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,360
saying no country should hinder it.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,580
Well let’s see how fantastic it’s been
for Venezuela.

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,580
Since 2007,

40
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,430
China has lent Venezuela about 63 billion
dollars.

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,840
That’s about half of all China’s lending

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,510
in Latin America.

43
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,890
And why not?

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,630
Venezuela is a socialist country.

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,830
And China loves socialism!

46
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,799
Especially with Chinese characteristics.

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
But a mutual love of socialism

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,650
is not the only reason Chinese officials

49
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,490
were so eager to befriend Venezuela.

50
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,600
One reason is influence.

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,860
Back in 2001,

52
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,299
China didn’t have much of a presence

53
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,479
in Latin America.

54
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,490
In fact, many Latin American countries

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,720
supported Taiwan.

56
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,310
But with Venezuela’s help,

57
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,489
China soon became a major player in the region.

58
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,310
In fact, China’s trade with Latin America

59
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,750
is now 22 times what it was back in 2000.

60
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,959
Another reason is oil.

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,430
Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves-

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,620
almost 300 billion barrels.

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,549
And that is music to the ears

64
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,999
of a resource-hungry country like China.

65
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,249
Yes, it was a match made in petroleum.

66
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,249
But in the end,

67
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,129
it wasn’t quite a win-win.

68
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,959
Remember those 63 billion dollars in loans?

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,900
Well, it turns out the Chinese Communist Party’s

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,919
no-strings-attached loans

71
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,219
actually do come with a string,

72
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,719
and it’s often in the shape of a noose.

73
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,040
According to the Foreign Policy,

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,519
“There was an important catch [to the loans];

75
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,340
to guarantee repayment,

76
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,889
Beijing insisted on being repaid in oil.”

77
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,819
And it seemed like a good deal at the time.

78
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,450
China gets the oil it wants,

79
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,230
and petroleum is what Venezuela does best!

80
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,450
It makes up half of the country’s GDP—

81
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,359
and 95% of total exports.

82
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,700
When China and Venezuela signed

83
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,359
their repayment-in-oil deal,

84
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,400
the price of oil was about $70 a barrel,

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,409
and then shot past $100.

86
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,799
But then in 2014,

87
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,529
the price of oil plummeted—

88
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:24,379
and now it’s only about 40-something dollars
a barrel.

89
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,700
That means, the amount of oil Venezuela

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,620
now has to give China to pay back its loans

91
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,430
has exploded.

92
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,260
And you really don’t want exploding oil.

93
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
More critically,

94
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,370
the drop in oil prices

95
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,810
has devastated the Venezuelan economy.

96
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,779
It’s gotten so bad that even basic necessities

97
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,439
are hard to come by.

98
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,809
McDonald’s literally had to stop selling
Big Macs last summer

99
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,409
because they were unable to get the middle
bun.

100
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,030
No, not the Big Mac!

101
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,030
What’s next?

102
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,249
The quarter pounder?

103
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,290
Or even worse,

104
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,549
the McRib?

105
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,040
But seriously, food in Venezuela

106
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,799
has become so scarce,

107
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:00,799
that I kid you not,

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,919
last year,

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,400
75% of the country lost an average of 19 pounds.

110
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,839
Although it doesn’t look like President
Nicolás Maduro

111
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,769
has lost any weight.

112
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,180
The effect of low oil prices

113
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,250
on Venezuela’s economy

114
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,639
is magnified because decades of extreme socialism

115
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,650
wrecked the country’s economy.

116
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,720
The government nationalized

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,390
most of the big industries.

118
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,390
Not just oil,

119
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,470
but eventually also food,

120
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,330
tourism, banking, telecom,

121
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,169
manufacturing, and more.

122
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,789
Meanwhile, Venezuela cut ties to the West

123
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,250
and cozied up to China and Russia.

124
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,580
That was all well and good

125
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,820
when high oil prices sustained

126
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,530
Venezuela’s socialist paradise.

127
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,810
But now...

128
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,130
well it doesn’t look like paradise anymore,
does it?

129
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,900
Over one hundred people have been killed

130
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,659
during the last four months of protests.

131
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,659
Police patrol the slums,

132
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,990
and extrajudicial killings are rife.

133
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,620
I mean this policeman is literally on fire.

134
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,379
And so is this guy.

135
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,090
This should not be a thing, people!

136
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,090
Some are even making

137
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,550
their own homemade rocket launchers.

138
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,430
Even the mascots are getting in on this!

139
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,520
Although that’s not an official

140
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,259
Mickey Mouse Gas Mask.

141
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,759
I know because during World War 2,

142
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,620
Disney really did make official

143
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,770
Mickey Mouse Gas Masks.

144
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,590
Venezuela is becoming a real life The Purge—

145
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,979
except that it won’t end in the morning.

146
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,120
So with all this chaos,

147
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,240
how is President Maduro still in power?

148
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,250
Because he has the guns, obviously.

149
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,699
Plus, on July 30,

150
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,490
a national election gave him sweeping powers

151
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,900
to rewrite Venezuela’s constitution.

152
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,030
I mean, sure the vote was a probably a sham—

153
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,510
but once you’re dictator,

154
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,950
who cares, right?

155
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,699
And you know who loves authoritarian regimes?

156
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,419
Other authoritarian regimes!

157
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,419
For example,

158
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,340
the Chinese Communist Party.

159
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,419
Guess where those Venezuelan police are getting

160
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,270
their “non-lethal” weapons and gear?

161
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,860
China has supplied President Maduro with

162
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,790
“armored vehicles, water cannons and tear
gas.”

163
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,060
And if you were worried about where

164
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,620
Venezuela is getting their “lethal” weapons
from,

165
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,729
well that’s also China–

166
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,900
almost $350 million dollars worth.

167
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,210
Plus Russia has supplied them

168
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,590
with even more.

169
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,389
Frankly, China’s massive loans to Venezuela

170
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,460
are one of the few things

171
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,639
keeping the economy going.

172
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,310
China is Venezuela’s biggest foreign lender.

173
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,270
And even now China continues to give

174
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,229
the Venezuelan government infusions of cash.

175
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,520
You might find it surprising—

176
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,289
since Venezuela is falling behind on oil deliveries.

177
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,120
In 2016, Venezuela’s state-owned oil enterprise

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,229
couldn’t even deliver 1.8 million barrels
of oil

179
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,710
to China’s state owned oil enterprise,

180
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,710
because they couldn’t afford

181
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,879
their storage space anymore.

182
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,879
But the the Chinese Communist Party

183
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,240
will still continue to support Venezuela.

184
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,090
The CCP gambles on regimes

185
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,819
like the one in Venezuela because

186
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,780
few other countries will do business with
them.

187
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,139
And that gives China an economic advantage,

188
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,379
with things like lucrative infrastructure
deals,

189
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,659
manufacturing deals,

190
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,830
and market access for Chinese companies.

191
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,680
As well as political advantages,

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,840
like influencing other countries in Latin
America.

193
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840


194
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
This is not to say that the CCP

195
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,069
is responsible for Venezuela’s economic
disaster.

196
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,439
No, Venezuela’s current and former presidents

197
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,280
are mostly to blame for that.

198
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,819
But the CCP has given massive loans to Venezuela,

199
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,480
which has ultimately made its debt problem
worse,

200
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,590
while also keeping Maduro’s regime afloat.

201
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,139
Anyway, even as Venezuela’s economy

202
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,490
continues to decline,

203
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,770
and President Maduro becomes

204
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,320
Supreme Dictator Maduro,

205
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,509
he’ll always have a friend in the CCP.

206
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,970
That’s because the CCP

207
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,289
doesn’t want the Maduro regime to fall.

208
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,830
You see, opposition leaders in Venezuela

209
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,810
are unhappy with the Chinese regime

210
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,229
because they see China as propping up Maduro,

211
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,219
and profiting off of Venezuela’s economic
disaster.

212
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,710
So if there is a regime change in Venezuela,

213
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,199
the next leader might just choose

214
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,139
to never repay China’s loans.

215
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,210
Although that doesn’t look like it’s going
to happen soon.

216
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,629
It seems like the Chinese Communist Party

217
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,120
just can’t quit the bad boys.

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,590
And that’s it for our show.

219
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,419
What do you think of China’s investments
in Venezuela?
