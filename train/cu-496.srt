1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,360
China’s spent years courting Europe

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,640
But some of China’s best laid plans

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
Are becoming its biggest failures

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,240
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Remember to support the show by liking this\h\h

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,680
episode, subscribing, or re-subscribing if\h
YouTube secretly unsubscribed you—it happens,\h\h

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
and sharing this video with\h
your friends and family.\h

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Speaking of our friends and allies, you might\h
think that China is doing pretty great when\h\h

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,520
it comes to Europe. After all, they signed a\h
new investment deal with the European Union\h\h

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,880
that pretty much lets them off the\h
hook when it comes to human rights.\h

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,280
Ok, sure they had to promise to try to maybe think\h
about possibly getting better at human rights,\h\h

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,720
but that’s not a big deal for the Chinese\h
Communist Party. They’re good at promising things.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,160
But their promises of win-win mutual cooperation\h
across all of Europe have hit a big snag.\h

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,080
And it’s kind of their own fault.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,120
Last week the Chinese Communist Party held\h
a virtual summit for the leaders of the\h\h

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,000
17+1 group of nations. And many of those\h
leaders just...didn’t bother showing up.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,680
What is the 17+1? Well the 17 is a group of\h
17 Central and Eastern European countries,\h\h

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,480
and the +1 is China.\h

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,120
The Chinese Communist Party\h
established the 17+1 back in 2012.\h\h

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,680
It’s a group that the Party has essentially tried\h
to use to divide and conquer Europe—by using\h\h

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,840
infrastructure investment, trade deals, and other\h
economic incentives to influence these countries.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,400
12 of these 17 countries are\h
part of the European Union,\h\h

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,800
which the Chinese Communist Party was\h
definitely looking to get on its side.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,640
We actually talked about this 17+1 group\h
in this episode from three years ago.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Back then it was only 16+1, but\h
then Greece was invited to join.\h\h

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,240
After all, Greece proved it\h
was a true friend of China\h\h

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,760
after blocking an EU statement condemning\h
China’s terrible human rights.\h

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,080
Which is exactly the kind of influence that China\h
was hoping these countries would have on the EU.\h

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
But three years after our\h
last episode on the 17+1,\h\h

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,400
the relationship has soured a little bit\h
between the 17 and the 1. That’s one reason why\h\h

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,160
some of the leaders of those countries skipped\h
a virtual summit that China held last week.

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
In fact, “Half of the 12 EU national leaders\h\h

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,960
invited to the club failed to show up to\h
pay homage to Chinese President Xi Jinping.”

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,760
Sure, everyone hates Zoom meetings.\h
But these European leaders\h\h

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
didn’t skip the meeting just because\h
they didn’t want to put on pants.

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,280
The six countries sent a lower-level\h
representative instead of their top leaders.\h\h

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,960
They were Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, and the\h
Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\h

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,920
And apparently the Baltic states, in\h
particular Lithuania, took the lead.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,720
It figures. Those Baltic\h
countries are such troublemakers.\h

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,560
This situation was especially embarrassing\h
for the Chinese Communist Party because\h\h

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,720
Xi Jinping was personally hosting the meeting.\h

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,360
Look, Xi Jinping doesn’t host Zoom\h
meetings for random Lithuanian ministers.\h\h

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
He expects to see the Lithuanian\h
president, President...Nauseda.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
And now it looks like President Nauseda just\h\h

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,160
didn’t think Xi Jinping was worth\h
the effort to put on a pair of pants.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,880
The point is, the Chinese Communist\h
Party wasn’t happy about this.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,000
“Only a day before the event, Chinese diplomats\h
were piling pressure on these capitals to send\h\h

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,880
‘a higher level representation,’ according to\h
a diplomat from one of these six countries.”

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
And apparently the Lithuanian\h
and Estonian ambassadors\h\h

49
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,880
were summoned to China’s foreign ministry\h
for a dressing down. Which they ignored.\h

50
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,240
So why did these European\h
countries snub the 17+1 summit?

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,840
I’ll tell you why after the break.

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Welcome back.

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Why did so many European countries\h
snub China’s 17+1 summit?\h\h

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,560
It’s because instead of being China’s gateway to\h
Europe, the 17+1 has become a zombie mechanism.

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,480
Hey, back in 2012 it sounded like a great\h
idea! China wanted to come to Central and\h\h

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,880
Eastern Europe, and it was looking to spend.\h
It promised to build new infrastructure,\h\h

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,640
to build new factories, to buy lots\h
of Central and Eastern European stuff.\h\h

58
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
And at first, things were looking good.

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
China set up a 10 billion dollar\h
credit line for the 17+1 countries.

60
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
There were big flagship projects\h\h

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,440
like a deal to build and develop new nuclear\h
reactors in Romania at the Cernavoda power plant.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Or the Budapest-Belgrade railway project,\h\h

63
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,960
which is eventually supposed to link\h
to the port of Piraeus in Greece.

64
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,600
The infrastructure projects that\h
were promised to the 17+1 group\h\h

65
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,480
were linked to China’s Belt and Road\h
Initiative, also known as One Belt, One Road.\h\h

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,600
But after almost a decade, most of these countries\h
would call it One Belt, One Road to Nowhere.\h

67
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
That’s because the Chinese\h
Communist Party continued to do\h\h

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
something that they do so much\h
of, it’s practically their motto.

69
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,040
Uh, no Seamus. Their other motto.\h

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,680
That’s right. Overpromise and underdeliver.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,640
A lot of the big flagship\h
infrastructure projects that the\h\h

72
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Chinese Communist Party promised have either made\h
very little progress, or haven’t happened at all.\h

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,880
“Instead of infrastructure, they\h
received forums; instead of factories\h\h

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,560
they received exchange programs; and instead\h
of exports they received summer camps.”

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,800
So these countries were expecting investment\h
and economic revitalization but instead\h\h

76
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
they just get invited to boring\h
Zoom meetings. Which explains why\h\h

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
they don’t think it’s worth putting\h
on a pair of pants for Xi Jinping.\h

78
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,520
Well, that and none of us fit into our pants\h
anymore after a year of coronavirus lockdowns.

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,320
Speaking of overinflated waistlines, that\h
flagship Budapest-Belgrade railway project\h\h

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,600
has been called a white elephant—a project\h
whose cost outweighs its usefulness.

81
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
That’s after Hungary signed a\h\h

82
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,440
1.9 billion dollar loan with China\h
to complete the project last spring.

83
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,320
And then classified all of the details\h
about the project for 10 years.

84
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,560
That’s after the project was “relaunched\h
and pushed through with extra government aid\h\h

85
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
despite mounting criticism.”

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,000
And fun fact, the railway is designed “to ship\h
Chinese goods from Greece to western Europe,\h\h

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,000
but key sections in the Balkans are missing.”

88
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
I’m sure they’ll get around\h
to building those...later.

89
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,840
What about the Romanian power plant deal?\h

90
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, funny story. Romania decided to get the\h
US to build those plants instead of China.

91
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Back in 2015, the Romanian government signed\h
a preliminary agreement with state-run China\h\h

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,600
General Nuclear Power Corporation, known\h
as CGN, to build the nuclear reactors.

93
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,560
Then in 2019, the US government blacklisted\h
CGN and other Chinese nuclear firms\h\h

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,120
for using US technology to help China’s military.

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,640
This happened right around\h
the same time as Romania’s\h\h

96
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,040
president was visiting the\h
US. And in a joint statement,\h\h

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,960
both countries pledged to “work closely together\h
to support Romania’s civil nuclear energy goals.”

98
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,640
Then in late 2019, a new Romanian government was\h
elected that was a little less friendly to China.\h\h

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,840
And the new prime minister announced that he was\h\h

100
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,440
cancelling the deal with CGN\h
to build the nuclear reactors.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Which eventually led to US\h
companies taking over the project.\h

102
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
In fact, the Romanian\h
government is now considering\h\h

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,400
banning Chinese companies from bidding\h
on infrastructure projects at all.

104
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
That’s something that’s happening\h
in the Czech Republic as well.

105
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
But the Romania story shows another big piece of\h\h

106
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
why the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s 17+1 project is stalling.

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,360
And that is: successful diplomacy from the\h
United States. Under the Trump Administration.

108
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,320
During the Romanian president’s\h
visit to the US in 2019,\h\h

109
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,480
Romania became the first country to sign\h
a memorandum of understanding with the US\h\h

110
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,240
that essentially banned Chinese telecom\h
Huawei from building its 5G infrastructure.

111
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,760
And that led to a ton of other\h
Central and Eastern European countries\h\h

112
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,440
either doing the same, or joining the Trump\h
Administration’s Clean Network Initiative.\h\h

113
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Which is also targeted at keeping Huawei from\h
building 5G infrastructure around the world.

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,440
And guess what, a lot of those\h
countries are 17+1 countries, too.

115
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,560
Well, that’s awkward.

116
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,320
So it seems that the US and its EU allies like\h
France and Germany haven’t been seeing eye-to-eye\h\h

117
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,080
regarding the threat from the Chinese Communist\h
Party. But under the Trump administration, the US\h\h

118
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,840
government spent a lot of effort reaching out to\h
these Central and Eastern European countries too.\h\h

119
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,520
This picture was of course pre-coronavirus,\h
when we all still shook hands. And wore pants.

120
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,680
But that successful diplomacy, together with\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s broken promises,\h\h

121
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,960
have turned a lot of the region\h
against the Chinese regime.

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Of course there are still countries like Hungary\h
that are holding out for some of that Belt and\h\h

123
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,440
Road money, but the disillusionment\h
among many 17+1 countries is real.\h

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Will that affect the rest of the EU?\h\h

125
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
I guess it depends on how much they believe\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s promises.

126
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,480
And now it’s time for me to answer a question\h
from the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army. Those\h\h

127
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,040
are viewers of the show who support China\h
Uncensored on the crowdfunding website Patreon.\h\h

128
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,160
We wouldn’t be able to do these episodes without\h
you. Find out more at Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

129
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,280
Greg asks,\h
Chris would it help if more people were made aware\h\h

130
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,880
of the investment firms that bankroll the Chinese\h
Communist Party??? I would think that if the\h\h

131
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,280
average individual investor knew the funds they\h
are investing are either Directly or Indirectly\h\h

132
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,320
supporting the Chinese Communist Party they would\h
demand that the practice would be stopped!!!\h\h

133
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,840
It seems PUBLIC SHAMING would force the\h
businesses involved to question their strategy!!!!

134
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
Well Greg, I do think this type of\h
public shaming works for companies that\h\h

135
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
have to answer to consumers. Like H&M,\h
which cut ties with their supplier after\h\h

136
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,680
accusations that they used cotton\h
made with forced labor in Xinjiang.

137
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
But when it comes to big investment\h
firms, that’s not as easy.\h\h

138
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Because for these companies, individual investors\h
are kind of small peanuts. You’d have to get\h\h

139
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,720
big investors, like institutions that have\h
tens or hundreds of millions of dollars\h\h

140
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,480
handled by these investment firms, to pull\h
out before it would make a big difference. Or\h\h

141
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
the government would have to step in,\h
like when the Trump administration\h\h

142
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,040
tried to ban Chinese military-linked\h
companies from trading on Wall Street.

But this is a huge problem that we need\h
to talk about. Because foreign investment\h\h

144
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,640
is definitely supporting the Chinese Communist\h

how you might be investing in China without\h\h

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
even knowing it. Let me know in the\h
comments if you’d like to see that.\h

147
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Thanks for your question, Greg.
