00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,940
Today's show is sponsored by Druid's Fluids...

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,180
for all your holy water needs.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,600
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We are playing Citation Needed.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,860
I have an almost-randomly selected article

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,680
from everybody's favourite reliable source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,680
and these folks can't see it.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,180
Every fact they get right gets them a point and a ding [DING]

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,520
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers which is...

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,540
Rather!

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,980
And today we are talking about... Bossche bol.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,160
The what?

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,520
Can you use that in a sentence for us?
[Laughter]

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,980
— Football!
— No.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,400
Are we talking a sport, though?

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,740
Not even close.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,980
Is it a type of ball?

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,700
— Well.
— Is it roughly spherical?

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,720
Yeah. It is roughly spherical.

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,860
— Okay.
— Is it a body part?

20
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,540
No.

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,740
Is it a seed, or fruit, or...

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
— It's a foodstuff. I'll give you a point for that. [DING]
— Ahh!

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
A Bossche bol is a foodstuff then.

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,320
Yes.

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,720
Is it deep-fried?

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,700
Er, no.

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,560
What?!

28
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,660
It's not from these shores, then.

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,500
Is it made of pieces of other things?

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
It's a foodstuff though, isn't it?

31
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,940
Every foodstuff, let's be honest,

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,700
unless you are eating pure sodium...

33
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,660
Yum yum yum!

34
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,960
...is pretty much made up of pieces of other things.

35
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,660
Yes.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,440
You get, like, a fishcake, or you get fish.

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,940
Okay! Er, no, it's made. It's made of other ingredients.

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,340
Is it of Africa?

39
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,260
It's Dutch!

40
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,480
— Dutch?
— Dutch.

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,300
— Booshe-ball?
— It's Dutch and... Bossche bol.

42
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,160
Bossche bol?

43
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,040
Bossche bol.
The Dutch people I know are going to kill me for...

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,840
Is it pickled?

45
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,680
No, not even close.
Completely the other end of the spectrum. In fact...

46
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,820
So it's raw!

47
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,320
If you had a spectrum —
no, in terms of taste — from pickle...

48
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,280
— Oh.
— ...and then took it all the way the other way...

49
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,760
— All right, it's something sweet then.
— Yes.

50
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,640
Right. It's a treat — a cake or something like that?

51
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,700
Yeah.

52
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,020
[Laughter]
And it's roughly spherical.

53
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Truffles.

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,920
And I don't know why I'm doing that.

55
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,280
Is it a sweet, cake-based Edam?

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,700
— You know what...
— What, gjetost?

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,580
That's actually close enough I'm going to give you it.

58
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,000
[DING]  It's basically an oversized profiterole.

59
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,760
— Ha! ...A what-sized?
— Yum yum yum!

60
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,900
Oversized profiterole.

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,060
How oversized?

62
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,280
The size of your head!

63
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,140
You can fit your head in it
and lick all the cream out of the inside

64
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,500
before you eat its remains.

65
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
Like a helmet.

66
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,580
Was that the rudiments of the Dutch space programme?

67
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,060
With a giant profiterole round the head of a man

68
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,460
in the lower atmosphere?

69
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
'Okay, the cream is keeping me fed.'

70
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,060
'I have eaten it all. I am too fat for the parachute.'

71
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,020
I'm glad we've finally washed up on

72
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,320
the nationality we're going to insult for this show.

73
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,360
No, but think about it. You could have the chocolate slice

74
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
as like a visor, couldn't you?

75
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Because the further up the atmosphere you go,

76
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,580
the colder it's going to get,
and the more solid she's gonna be.

77
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,600
All right, it won't survive reentry very well
if it's chocolate, but you know.

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,160
You've got the cream for insulation.

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,920
Yeah!

80
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,220
...Not a phrase I've said before.

81
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
Again, as it gets — yeah!

82
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
They had a point, these Dutch people

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,480
with their profiterole space programme.

84
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,280
You could fit them inside a giant Twinkie,

85
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,720
or Barny Bear or something as the space suit.

86
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,560
So Bossche Bol was the name of their first space capsule?

87
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,120
...yes. Yes.
[Laughter]

88
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,060
Bossche Bol One!

89
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,640
Yes. Absolutely. In the same way

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,420
that the first French spaceship was called 'Profiterole'.

91
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
— Was it?
— No.

92
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,340
— I did not know that.
— It won't be called Profiterole, you nob-head, would it?

93
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,220
— It was called 'Baguette'.
— It was called 'Baguette'.

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
Profiteroles are small, duh!

95
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,160
We're talking one that's as big as a space helmet here!

96
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,680
We're actually talking about one that's about five inches.

97
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,140
A little bit bigger than my button here.

98
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,480
There is a bit of culinary advice in this article...

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,100
What's the best way to avoid spillage when eating a Bossche bol?

100
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,220
Sit on it.

101
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,580
Eat it whole.

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,400
Ride it.

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Puncture it, suck out its delicious innards,

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,560
and then consume the outside.

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes.

106
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
Squeeze it like a spot.

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,000
[Prolonged squirting noises]

108
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,040
No?

109
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,540
No, unsurprisingly.

110
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,840
With a spoon.

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The best way to avoid spillage from your Bossche bol,

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,940
is the question you're asking us.

113
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,780
Yes. Yes, I am.

114
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,640
Is there a special receptacle for this?

115
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,900
The Bossce bol sphere, for instance.

116
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,620
I don't like Bossche bol spillage.

117
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
— No, who does?
— I'm not a fan.

118
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,240
Vanish won't touch it, will it?

119
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,700
You turn it upside down.

120
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, actually it says 'The best way to avoid spillage

121
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,380
is by eating the pastry upside down',

122
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,200
and I don't know whether that means the pastry...

123
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
— Or the person?
— ...or the person.

124
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
That's my kind of dessert.

125
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
The kind that you have to be strapped down for.

126
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
That's the taste sensation I'm looking for.

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
All right, we've got a three-person slingshot

128
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,560
and a Bossche bol. Here we go!

129
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,940
Yes!

130
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,340
What would it feel like to be hit

131
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,560
by a five-inch-wide profiterole at speed?

132
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,160
Well, based on the juggling ball I got hit with,

133
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,520
it'll be bloody painful.

134
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,320
I got hit by a water balloon in the face. That was painful.

135
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Oh yeah! You ended up with a real big welt, didn't you?

136
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
I've still got the animated GIF of that somewhere.

137
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'll see if I can cut and paste it in about here.

138
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm thinking, what would the cream do?

139
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,540
Would it go... would it be like...

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,700
Not evaporate, but the action when it melts and...

141
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,540
I like to think that it would turn non-Newtonian.

142
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,960
It'd go solid and you're just knocked unconscious.

143
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,680
I can believe that. That water balloon hurt.

144
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh, Christ! If you did it with a custard-filled one,
it would do that!

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,140
— Ohhh!
— It would, wouldn't it?

146
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,620
Because custard *is* non-Newtonian!

147
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,180
Only if it's not sugary.

148
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,940
If you put sugar in, you actually turn it into just regular...

149
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,240
— Right.
— But it would still be enough to...

150
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,340
Hang on, we've discovered a new weapon, chaps!

151
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,340
If you could put that in the barrel of a Navy frigate...

152
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
'Cause I've seen that episode of Dad's Army

153
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,860
where they fire onions at people,

154
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,160
and that looked like it hurt, so I...

155
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,760
Factually accurate ballistics!

156
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Steel and depleted uranium —

157
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,900
custard-filled chocolate.

158
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm not saying it's used for destruction,

159
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm saying it's used for shock and awe.

160
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
Splat and awe, really, wouldn't it?

161
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,120
There is a bigger version of the Bossche bol,
just to drag us back...

162
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,840
The Super Bossche Bol!

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,340
Well, you see, that's pretty close.

164
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,980
I don't actually want the Dutch word for it,

165
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,400
but if you could tell me what it's called
when you translate it to English.

166
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,840
The Mega-Ball.

167
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,420
The Very Big Profiterole.

168
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
You know what, I'm going to give you both points.
It's 'giant ball'.

169
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,180
[DING DING]

170
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
What I love is that in the 'See also' section of this page

171
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,360
is just 'List of pastries'.

172
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Let's see how many we can guess.

173
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,800
Quickfire round! Name some pastries. Matt.

174
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,580
Errr... Danish pastry.

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
Point! [DING] Gary.

176
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,700
Cream horn.

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,620
— Oh good Lord.
— Point! [DING]

178
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,980
Choux bun!

179
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,040
I tried to spell that 'shoe' there and it didn't work.

180
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,780
Also that!

181
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,340
I'll give you a point. It's under 'Éclair', but yes, point. [DING]

182
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,460
Éclair.

183
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,140
Point. [DING]
[Laughter]

184
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,160
Viennese whirl.

185
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,440
Good Lord.

186
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,460
No, it's not on the list.

187
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
BULL****!

188
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
That's not pastry. That's a biscuit.

189
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,200
Ooh. You could have me on a technicality there.

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,900
I also like — in here we have:

191
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,580
'Cronut' has already made its way into Wikipedia.

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
[Groans]
Who eats one? I don't und—

193
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,100
I don't... yeah. What?

194
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,880
Is it a croissant and a doughnut?

195
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,160
It's a doughnut made of croissant pastry bread dough.

196
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,320
But isn't that just...

197
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,000
a croissant with a hole chopped out of the middle?

198
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,520
No, it's deep-fried instead of baked.

199
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
You know those Yum Yums they have in Greggs?

200
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,180
— Oh, it's a Yum Yum, is it?
— It's one of them, yeah.

201
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
Only it's made with croissant dough.

202
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,040
So it's butterier and more layers and such.

203
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,760
And causes more flakiness
down the front of a shirt of a morning.

204
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,640
The horror.

205
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
I've never thought, 'Ooh, I don't know

206
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,360
whether I want a croissant or a doughnut.'

207
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,340
— Someone did.
— I want one or the other.

208
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,320
I don't get the whole American breakfast thing,

209
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,580
of having like, doughnuts —

210
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,340
something that sweet and that sugary, first thing.

211
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,260
You've eaten Ricicles.

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay.

213
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,240
Oh man, Ricicles! With the little spaceman.

214
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
— Spaceman!
— Captain Rik, yeah.

215
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,740
Good grief. Do they still make those?

216
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
— Yes.
— I don't think they do...

217
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,880
— No.
— I've not seen Ricicles for a long time.

218
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
On the other hand, if we do find some...

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,520
— We're having them.
— I'm having them tomorrow.

220
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,420
According to everyone's favourite unreliable source of knowledge,

221
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,940
yes, they still sell them.

222
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,000
— Yes!
— Ahhh!

223
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,960
In the UK?

224
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
They don't put them in the variety packs any more, though.

225
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,000
That's all right. I could eat a whole box.

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
— In one sitting!
— What, just by the fistful?

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
Out of the box!

228
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,240
Well, you remember the box of Coco Pops I brought

229
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,020
last time we did this. I ate them in two days.

230
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,500
I think a box of Ricicles in one sitting's on.

231
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,420
Fistful Of Ricicles.

232
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540
— That's just a western movie!
— For A Few Ricicles More.

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
The Good, The Bad and Captain Rik.

234
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Yes! All these!

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,140
Just Coco the monkey, sat with a hat down over his eyes,

236
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,380
at the side, just throwing a knife up and down.

237
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,880
Are we saying Tony the Tiger's the sheriff?

238
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,780
There's an entire section of the Cronut article on 'Controversy'.

239
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,660
Can anyone tell me how much they were selling for?

240
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,040
Because the original Cronut is trademarked to one bakery.

241
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
They were selling them for five dollars.

242
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,600
How much were scalpers selling them for later in the day?

243
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,840
You can't —well, they're not going to last that long, are they?

244
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,840
Being a French-based bread product,

245
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,600
they'd have gone off within about an hour and gone stale.

246
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,520
As we previously established.

247
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah. So I'm going to say twenty dollars.

248
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,060
Twenty dollars? You know what...

249
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,700
Even though it's a terrible way of doing it,

250
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm going to do Price Is Right rules here.

251
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,780
— Ohh!
— So closest without going over.

252
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Can we have the little yodelling man going up a hill here?

253
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,420
No. Twenty dollars?

254
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,420
— Yes.
— Chris.

255
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,720
Twenty dollars and one cent.

256
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,460
— Ohhh!
[Laughter]

257
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,540
Nine.

258
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,840
Nine dollars?

259
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
One hundred dollars!
[DING] You get the point.

260
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,120
Yes!

261
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,980
F*** off! For a bloody pastry?!

262
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
It was one of those things where

263
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,300
the public get a fixation on it, and it starts...

264
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,220
It's basically Bitcoin in pastry form.

265
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,940
You could almost get a flight to Paris!

266
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,000
Except it lasts longer.

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,420
ALL: Wahey!

268
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,700
Can anyone give me some of the alternate names

269
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,540
that people have called the Cronut, just to get around the...

270
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Donant!

271
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,360
Fatty Wheel!

272
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Flaky Death!

273
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Fat Whirl!

274
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,320
Fat Whirl. No.

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,020
Dosant?

276
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,560
Dosant! Point. [DING]

277
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Isn't that just close to selling a 'doesn't'?

278
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,380
Also on the list of pastries,

279
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,620
we have something called 'Nun's Puffs'.

280
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Brannan! I feel this is your...

281
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,420
— Hellooo?
— Please make a nun sequitur.

282
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,220
— [Groans]
— Heyyy!

283
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,880
'Nun sequitur' — that took me like three seconds.

284
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,180
That was good.

285
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,880
Oh, don't monk around any more, then.

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,200
I've had that joke on a list for years

287
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,940
and that is the first time I've been able to use it!

288
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
You're lucky, because you were
really nunchalant when you delivered it.

289
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,740
[Groans]

290
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,700
It's not the habit you want to get into.

291
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,380
[Laughter]
Now...

292
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
Leave you wimpole-ing in a corner, if you keep doing that.

293
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,860
[Groans]

294
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,780
It's listed as 'nun's puffs'.

295
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,540
That is a euphemism.
Can you tell me what they're actually called?

296
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,880
I read about this recently! It's...

297
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,660
Are they those little round buns

298
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,020
with icing and a cherry on top?

299
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,180
Er... not the cherry,

300
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
but they're basically kind of a light dessert pastry.

301
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,000
Are they the ones that have the name 'nun's farts'?

302
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,940
Point! [DING] And...

303
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
They are called 'nun's farts'...
[Laughter]

304
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,600
...and they are just a ball of pastry

305
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
that is very, very light, with a cream filling in them.

306
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,200
So, profiteroles?

307
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
— ...but smaller.
— Under another name, yes.

308
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,440
Sorry...

309
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,660
'Could I have a nun's fart, please?'

310
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,580
'Of course. Sister!'

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
'That'll be five pounds, please.'

312
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
And then you sell it on later for a hundred.

313
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,220
In a jar.

314
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
On that note, I think Matt, you got most points —

315
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,780
I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not counting.

316
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,840
I certainly didn't get any, so it wasn't me this time.

317
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Matt, congratulations — you win a copy of the game

318
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,200
where you have to get executives of a disgraced bank

319
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,420
to jump through pipes and defeat Bowser.

320
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,240
Super Lehman Brothers.

321
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,120
It's all right! Enough time's passed for that one. We're fine.

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Until next time...
that's been Matt Gray!

323
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,440
Bye-bye!

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
That's been Gary.

325
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,420
...Brannan. I didn't say your name there.

326
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,040
What a nob-head, everybody(!)

327
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
We've been working together for what, how long now?

328
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,960
Up yours, nob-head.

329
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,500
CHRIS: That was Gary Brannan...

330
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,320
And that's Chris Joel.

331
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,620
Bye!

332
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,400
I've...
Sod it!

333
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
Look at his face!

334
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
That was a good pastry-based episode there. I liked that.

335
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,620
[Laughter]

336
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,240
Thanks for watching!

337
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
