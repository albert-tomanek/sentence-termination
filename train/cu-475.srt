1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,610
China is dumping near the Philippines.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,200
Protests in Cuba are freaking out the Chinese
Communist Party

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,030
And the US issues a warning to companies in
Hong Kong.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:22,460
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:35,080
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,650
You should be using a VPN like Surfshark to
protect yourself whenever you go online.

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,770
So, China is involved in territorial disputes
with all its neighbors in the South China

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,770
Sea.

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,530
Particularly the Philippines.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,200
But to show who’s number 1, China is taking
a number 2.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,980
That’s right, Chinese ships are dumping
human waste in disputed territorial waters.

13
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,649
That’s according to Simularity, , an AI-based
satellite image analysis firm.

14
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:12,031
Satellite images captured hundreds of Chinese
ships off the Spratly Islands—which are

15
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,679
near the Philippines.

16
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:17,970
And those Chinese ships left behind, uhh,
refuse.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,340
Yes, Chinese ships have dumped so much poop
in the South China Sea, you can see it from

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,920
space.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,819
Over 200 Chinese ships were spotted here in
a single day.

20
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:34,460
But Simularity found over the past 5 years,
the untreated sewage from all these Chinese

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,310
ships has caused “algae blooms that have
damaged coral reefs and threatened fish in

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,359
an unfolding catastrophe”.

23
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:48,409
According to Liz Derr , the head of Simularity,
“When the ships don’t move, the poop piles

24
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,409
up.

25
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,959
The hundreds of ships that are anchored in
the Spratlys are dumping raw sewage onto the

26
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,240
reefs they are occupying.”

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
These ships are likely part of China’s maritime
militia.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,079
Technically civilian ships, but in practice,
an extension of the People’s Liberation

29
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,279
Army.

30
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:08,550
Clearly waging war by other means.

31
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,530
The Philippines has launched a...probe...into
China’s sewage-dumping.

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,660
I feel pretty bad for anyone on the investigation
team.

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,570
Again, “It is so intense you can see it
from space.”

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,920
I guess you could say China is literally dumping
on other countries’ territorial claims.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,680
Speaking of territorial disputes, 5 years
ago, a ruling by an international tribunal

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,220
in the Hague rejected China’s claims in
the South China Sea.

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,280
Which of course Beijing has completely ignored
and the international community has done nothing

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
about.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,030
But for the five year anniversary, US Secretary
of State Antony Blinken is, well doing more

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,500
of the same nothing.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,130
He said in a statement, “We call on the
PRC to abide by its obligations under international

42
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,500
law, cease its provocative behavior, and take
steps to reassure the international community

43
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,370
that it is committed to the rules-based maritime
order that respects the rights of all countries,

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,370
big and small.”

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,480
Yeah, that’ll show ‘em!

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,350
That’s basically been the driving force
of the Biden Administration’s China policy—get

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,250
the Chinese Communist Party to play by the
international rules.

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,280
But the Party has never done that.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,660
The Party will never do that.

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,380
But maybe if Canada calls for it too, then
the Party will cave!

51
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,020
Well it was a nice ocean while we had it.

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,980
A Chinese spy ship appears to be positioning
itself to spy on US-Australian war games.

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,100
The war games are called Exercise Talisman
Saber.

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,870
It’s the largest bilateral military training
exercise between the US and Australia.

55
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,050
It happens every two years.

56
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,470
Australia’s Defence Minister doesn’t seem
too worried about the Chinese Spy ship, since

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,830
there’s always a Chinese spy ship.

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,141
He told ABC, “The presence of similar vessels
did not detract from Talisman Sabre 2017 or

59
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:10,810
Talisman Sabre 2019, and we are confident
that it will not impede this year.”

60
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,400
But I got to say, I actually don’t blame
China for spying this time.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,310
I also want to know how Australia trained
all those kangaroos to sail a ship.

62
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,950
And after the break, China responds to the
massive protests in Cuba.

63
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,370
Welcome back.

64
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,570
Cuba has erupted in protests of the Cuban
Communist Party’s authoritarian rule.

65
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,360
And the regimes of Russia, China, and Iran
are warning the US not to intervene.

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,290
I mean, it would be tragic to lose another
country to freedom.

67
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,100
China is, of course, one of Cuba’s biggest
allies.

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,290
US Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban American,
accused China of building Cuba’s internet

69
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,100
censorship system.

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,180
Which couldn’t have been too hard to do
considering people were only legally allowed

71
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,400
to have internet at home starting in 2019.

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,980
That’s right, the Cuban Communist Party
didn’t let its citizens have private WiFi

73
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,120
networks until 2019.

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,750
And even today, the internet is censored and
you have to get a permit.

75
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,440
And it’s all because of...US sanctions of
course.

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes, the Cuban government is saying all the
problems people are protesting are a result

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
of US sanctions.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,800
Definitely not, “the country’s Soviet-style,
centrally planned economy and its hesitation

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,370
to adopt market-oriented reforms”.

80
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,760
Or the way the Cuban regime arrests, beats,
and kills protesters.

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,210
No, you see, when the Cuban protesters shout
“down with communism”, what they actually

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,639
mean is “down with the US.”

83
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,930
My favorite Chinese state-run media, the Global
Times , said “These actions of social violence

84
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,780
are part of the unconventional war scheme
that US governments have been applying against

85
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,730
Cuba to provoke the long-awaited ‘regime
change.’”

86
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,910
Again, the Communist Party has done nothing
wrong.

87
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,420
I feel like that’s a message the Global
Times is mainly trying to get Chinese people

88
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
to listen to.

89
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,510
So they don’t get any ideas.

90
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,550
The US has blacklisted 23 more Chinese companies
over abuses in Xinjiang

91
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,600
“Of the 23 companies added to the blacklist,
the Commerce Department accused 14 of direct

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,900
involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang,
five of ‘directly supporting’ the Chinese

93
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,180
military’s ‘modernization programs,’
and four of violating previous US sanctions

94
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,740
by doing business with blacklisted companies.”

95
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,550
I’m happy to say this is one tradition the
Biden Administration has carried over from

96
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,210
the previous administration.

97
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,040
China has of course said it will retaliate.

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,120
No details were given.

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,500
Because of course, there’s nothing the Chinese
Communist Party can do about it.

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,660
China can’t sanction the US.

101
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,699
Well, it has sanctioned US officials.

102
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,370
But that was pretty meaningless.

103
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,560
It’s not like Mike Pompeo has a lot of assets
in Chinese banks.

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,400
Speaking of ganging up on the Chinese Communist
Party, 21 countries have formed

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,940
the “Media Freedom Coalition” and are
specifically criticizing the Hong Kong government

106
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,540
for shutting down the pro democracy newspaper
Apple Daily.

107
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,139
Apple Daily was forced to shut down after
the Hong Kong government froze its assets

108
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,570
and arrested a bunch of people.

109
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,650
You know, normal stuff.

110
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,639
Hong Kong authorities have also arrested 5
more people in an alleged bomb plot.

111
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,020
Last week they arrested 9.

112
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,139
Police accused them of “planning to manufacture
and plant explosives around the city, including

113
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,669
in courts, cross-harbor tunnels and trash
cans.”

114
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,690
There’s definitely no way the Hong Kong
government would be using alleged terrorism

115
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,830
as an excuse to crush individual civil liberties
in the city.

116
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,710
No regime has ever done something like that.

117
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,830
China is also slamming the sinister US, for
several reasons, including Hong Kong.

118
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,410
“The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced
a planned White House warning to American

119
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,350
businesses in Hong Kong.”

120
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,350
He said, “The US side has confounded black
and white by smearing the National Security

121
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,009
Law for [Hong Kong] and Hong Kong’s business
environment in a bid to mislead American and

122
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,530
other international enterprises in Hong Kong.”

123
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,030
Yeah, just because American businesses in
Hong Kong will be completely at the mercy

124
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,040
of the Chinese Communist Party, that’s no
reason to warn them about it.

125
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,339
They might get scared and leave.

126
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,030
But China is also concerned about a Digital
Trade Deal the US is pushing with countries

127
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,360
in the Indo Pacific.

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,050
Imagine if those countries had alternatives
to working with the Chinese Communist Party.

129
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,260
As China Daily says, “These deals invariably
serve the US’ bid to defend its hegemony.”

130
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,570
“To the signatory countries, these US-dominated
agreements are more like shackles restricting

131
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,890
trade and their freedom of cooperation.”

132
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, no country has the right to put shackles
on anyone or restrict their freedom.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,560
Except China.

134
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,890

When you go online, you need to be using a
VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.

136
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,480
Everything you do online is being tracked
and logged—by the websites you visit and

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,420
your internet service provider.

138
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,060
And in many cases, by the government.

139
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,630
And if you’re in an authoritarian country—like
China or Cuba, or really most countries—you

140
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,740
should take this seriously.

141
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,000
Even innocent things you do online can be

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,640
