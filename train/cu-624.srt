1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,920
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,120
China gets feisty with Feinstein.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,660
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,820
This is Devin Nunes,

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,560
a US congressman from California.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,910
He’s been working to derail

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,430
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,730
into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,150
Now imagine what would happen

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,690
if the FBI discovered that a staffer for Nunes,

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,180
who had worked for him for 20 years, had been
spying for Russia.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,840
And all Nunes did was quietly fire him and
then keep it under wraps.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
I think people would freak out.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,210
Now, this is Dianne Feinstein, a US Senator
from California.

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,090
Turns out, one of her long-time staffers was
allegedly a spy—

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,260
for the Chinese Communist Party.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,030
“The Chinese spy was Feinstein’s driver
for 20 years,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,820
who also served as a gofer in her Bay Area
office,

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,059
and who was a liaison to the Asian American
community.

21
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,070
He even attended Chinese consulate functions
for the Senator.”

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,070
Five years ago,

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,430
the FBI came to Feinstein with this information,

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,230
and she quietly dismissed the guy.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,700
No one else on her staff even knew.

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,390
It only came out recently,

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,510
thanks to this brief blurb in a Politico article.

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,420
Now this was at a time when Feinstein

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,880
was the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Not to worry.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,600
“A spokesperson for Feinstein said...

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
no Feinstein staffer in California

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,049
has ever had a security clearance.”

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,159
Oh, well that is a relief.

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,890
A possible Chinese spy was close to a US senator

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,560
while she sat on a sensitive intelligence
committee,

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,780
but his lack of security clearance means

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,030
he definitely never heard anything

39
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,150
at any point that could be a political advantage

40
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,869
to the Chinese regime.

41
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:52,869
Whew.

42
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,260
It’s not clear right now how much this alleged
spy

43
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,229
was able to communicate with his handlers,

44
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,750
and the FBI apparently didn’t think

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,760
they had enough evidence to prosecute.

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,920
In fact, this San Francisco Chronicle story
makes it seem like

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,569
he was more of an accidental spy...

48
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,629
who thought he was just talking to a friend,

49
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:16,069
who happened to work for the Chinese Ministry
of State Security.

50
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,629
This is why I always say, never make any friends.

51
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,480
Remember that, kids.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
But you know what?

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,659
The spying part...isn’t even the most interesting
part of this story.

54
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,999
We’re just getting started.

55
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,909
See, the Chinese Communist Party has been
working hard

56
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,280
to influence important people in the United
States,

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,529
to guide our country on a more “China friendly”
path.

58
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:42,969
China experts have called this strategy “elite
capture.”

59
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,299
Getting the wealthy and influential on your
side.

60
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,430
But you can’t just capture elites by luring
them into

61
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,440
a trap set with fine wine and caviar.

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,389
So how does the Chinese Communist Party do
it?

63
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,599
Take a look at this Hudson Institute report,

64
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,819
The Chinese Communist Party's Foreign Interference
Operations.

65
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,870
Under the section, “China’s Willing American
Enablers,” it says,

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,659
“For everyone from businesspeople to politicians,

67
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,060
the promise of market access to China....

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,299
is a powerful incentive to work with the Chinese
government

69
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:17,349
and acquiesce to its broader agenda.”

70
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,989
In other words, money.

71
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,629
I know, what a surprise.

72
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,349
It turns out Senator Dianne Feinstein is

73
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,839
a perfect example of elite capture.

74
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:31,139
She knew that the Chinese government was taking
an interest in her.

75
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,959
The FBI warned her of that back in 1997.

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,239
Why would the Chinese regime be interested?

77
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,139
Here’s former FBI agent Josh Harp,

78
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,079
who used to run counter-espionage for the
FBI in the Bay Area,

79
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,730
talking about Dianne Feinstein.

80
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,150
“You know anybody who sits on the House
Intelligence Committee,

81
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,809
they all have a top secret security clearance
and even higher,

82
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:56,199
and those people are all prime targets of
opportunity.”

83
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,250
And Feinstein didn’t exactly

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,199
make it difficult for Chinese officials

85
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,120
to get close to her.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,419
Now I’m not saying Dianne Feinstein is a
spy

87
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,980
or that she did something illegal.

88
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,139
I’m not accusing her of that.

89
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,510
But I am saying, records show Feinstein had

90
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,060
very close dealings with the Chinese Communist
Party.

91
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,430
And in particular,

92
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,030
everyone’s favorite mass murder and natterjack
toad—

93
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,030
Jiang Zemin!

94
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,530
And the two of them made sweet music together.

95
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,200
I wonder what future dictators sing at karaoke.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,820
What’s that, Shelley?

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,420
“One Day When We Were Young”?

98
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,090
Well, that’s disappointing.

99
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,000
I thought it would be something like “Highway
to Hell.”

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,440
Or at least “We are the Champions.”

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,980
So how did this duet begin, you ask?

102
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,310
Well, Feinstein was the mayor of San Francisco
from 1978 to 1988.

103
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,600
And the Chinese Communist Party is very interested
in keeping

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,520
close ties to San Francisco’s Chinese community.

105
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360
As the LA Times wrote,

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,880
Mayor Feinstein had a close relationship with
Jiang Zemin,

107
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,720
who was then the mayor and party secretary
of Shanghai.

108
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,930
In 1980, Mayor Feinstein made Shanghai the
sister city of San Francisco.

109
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,770
It was the first sister city relationship
the US had with China.

110
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,200
In fact, the two cities are still sisters
to this day,

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,210
thanks to Feinstein and Jiang’s “lasting
ties.”

112
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,910
But back when San Francisco’s sister relationship
with Shanghai began,

113
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,310
Feinstein was just a mayor,

114
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,700
and so was Jiang Zemin.

115
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,680
Jiang didn’t become the leader of China
until after 1989,

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,800
when he supported killing all those students
in Tiananmen Square.

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,390
Ok, I know that sounds bad.

118
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,010
But, as Feinstein put it in 2010:

119
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,580
That whole Tiananmen Square incident is in
the past.

120
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,610
And one learns from the past.

121
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,290
And China has learned a lesson.

122
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,780
And that lesson is, brainwash the next generation

123
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,050
into forgetting it ever happened.

124
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,860
That’s not a joke.

125
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,640
That’s what they did.

126
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,430
Anway, Feinstein and Jiang’s relationship
began

127
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,090
in the simpler times of the 1980s,

128
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,050
well before the alleged Chinese spy in her
office,

129
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,300
and definitely before Jiang would rise to
power

130
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,120
and launch a systematic campaign

131
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,060
to kill Falun Gong practitioners for their
organs.

132
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,680
Apparently, “Feinstein became friends with
Shanghai’s mayor,

133
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,830
Jiang Zemin,

134
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,770
and the two visited each other regularly;

135
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,990
Jiang once spent Thanksgiving in San Francisco”

136
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,580
with Feinstein and her husband.

137
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,440
Why, Jiang even danced with Feinstein

138
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,690
during one of those visits.

139
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,680
Ok, dancing and singing together is one thing,

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,540
but did Feinstein’s friendship with Jiang
affect

141
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,420
how she treated US-China relations?

142
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,480
Well, back in the 1990s, a lot of US officials

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,760
were reluctant to normalize trade with China

144
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,110
because of that whole Tiananmen Square whoopsie-daisy.

145
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,140
Congress had to re-approve trade with China
every year.

146
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,080
But Feinstein wanted to change that.

147
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,760
In 1996 she wrote this op-ed for the LA Times
called,

148
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,890
“Most-Favored Status Is Not a Perk.”

149
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,230
It’s not?

150
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,260
I’m pretty sure becoming most favored anything
is a perk.

151
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,640
Anyway, she wrote,

152
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,300
“We should grant most-favored-nation status

153
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,139
to China on a permanent basis and get past

154
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,720
the annual dance that is proving to be extraordinarily
divisive.”

155
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
Also, remember,

156
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,430
this was only seven years after the Tiananmen
Massacre.

157
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,850
Surely the Communist Party had completely
changed by then!

158
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,810
Well, according to Feinstein, it had.

159
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,480
“The positive changes in China have been
dramatic.

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
Chinese society continues to open up

161
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,139
with looser ideological controls,

162
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,690
freer access to outside sources of information

163
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,870
and increased media reporting.

164
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,510
More people in China vote for their leadership
on the local level

165
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,960
than do Americans.”

166
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,139
Um...you realize that the local “voting”
doesn’t count

167
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,380
when the Communist Party picks all the candidates,
right?

168
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,470
Fortunately for Feinstein,

169
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,960
she wasn’t alone in her support for China...

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,350
and Jiang Zemin.

171
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,620
There was also this guy.

172
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,830
Then-president Bill Clinton wanted China

173
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,730
in the World Trade Organization.

174
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,730
Or, you could say, American corporations

175
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,830
wanted access to the China market,

176
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,180
and Bill Clinton did his best to represent

177
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,230
his well-funded constituents.

178
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,920
But when trade talks with China started going
sour,

179
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,680
in August 1999,

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,840
the White House sent Feinstein there meet
with Jiang Zemin

181
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,230
and encourage him to resume negotiations.

182
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,500
And eventually, Clinton and Feinstein successfully
got China

183
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,320
to join the World Trade Organization.

184
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,529
And now—as you know—

185
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,610
China plays by all the international rules,

186
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,409
has a vibrant democracy,

187
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,209
respects human rights, and...haha, no.

188
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,779
It was a total failure.

189
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,539
Although that’s not how some see it.

190
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,009
Senator Feinstein told the Washington Post
in 2010

191
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,550
that China has gotten soooo much better.

192
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,209
She said, “There was originally

193
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,220
this kind of anti-communist view of China.

194
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,850
That’s changing...

195
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,800
China is a socialist country but one that
is

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,110
increasingly becoming capitalistic.”

197
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,959
Well, I guess selling people’s organs for
profit is capitalistic.

198
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,050
And that kind of optimism spreads to the people
around Feinstein.

199
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,850
I mean, besides that alleged Chinese spy.

200
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,260
In 2011, her former aide,

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,069
Peter Ruffo joined the Chinese telecom giant
ZTE

202
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:22,610
as their first in-house political lobbyist.

203
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,040
Ruffo is still ZTE’s lobbyist.

204
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,089
Even though the House Intelligence Committee

205
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,300
has been warning for 6 years that ZTE

206
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,110
poses a national security threat to the US.

207
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,139
But it’s not just Feinstein’s former staff
who

208
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,040
are enamored with totally-not-communist China.

209
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,980
This may shock you,

210
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,050
but while Dianne Feinstein

211
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,570
was arguing for more trade with China,

212
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,839
her husband Richard Blum was making

213
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,610
an awful lot of money...

214
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,730
in China.

215
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,790
“In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang designated
several corporate entities

216
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,250
for fostering commercial relations,

217
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,720
one named Shanghai Pacific Partners.

218
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,360
Feinstein’s husband served as a director.”

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,279
That project also involved state-run Shanghai
Investment Trust Corp.

220
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,170
And it “was cited by Chinese officials as
a testament

221
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,519
to the friendly business ties between Shanghai

222
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,709
and San Francisco that Feinstein had initiated.”

223
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,829
And business grew.

224
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,389
In May 1994, in a speech delivered on the
Senate floor,

225
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,910
Feinstein urged President Clinton to increase

226
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,330
favorable trade relations with China—

227
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,139
at the same time her husband Blum planned
to invest

228
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,100
up to $150 million there on behalf of several
clients.

229
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,139
Now, both Feinstein and her husband said that
his businesses

230
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,410
did not benefit from her China relationships.

231
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,100
And that he had his own relationships in China.

232
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,160
But their behavior still raised eyebrows.

233
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,209
“Feinstein took three trips between 1995
and 1997 to China,

234
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,269
in addition to trips earlier in her mayoral
service,

235
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,379
to meet with top communist officials,

236
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,050
including Jiang [Zemin].

237
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,089
Blum often attended the meetings with her,

238
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,199
an arrangement the Times described as ‘unusual.’”

239
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:15,010
In one instance, in 1996, Jiang Zemin took
Feinstein

240
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,629
and her husband to the home of Mao Zedong.

241
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,439
They were the first foreigners to see his
bedroom and swimming pool.

242
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,220
It was very historic.

243
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,899
Like, if you got to see Stalin’s old bedroom
and swimming pool,

244
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,180
the first thought on your mind would be how
historic it was.

245
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,990
All these private meetings with Jiang Zemin

246
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,970
and the couple were very good for Blum’s
business,

247
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,889
according to American experts in Chinese business
practices.

248
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,279
Now a spokesperson for Feinstein said that
by 1999,

249
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,470
her husband had gotten rid of his last holdings
in mainland China.

250
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,519
Which is good because at the time she was
really pushing

251
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,889
for China’s entry into the WTO,

252
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,639
and that would be a conflict of interest,
right?

253
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,440
Anyway, I think we should totally trust Feinstein

254
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,679
when she said her husband had gotten rid of

255
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,779
his mainland China holdings.

256
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,660
Because technically, maybe it was true.

257
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,740
It’s just that his Newbridge Capital was
investing

258
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,550
$400 million dollars in East Asia,

259
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,449
and at least $90 million of that was invested
in companies

260
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:23,679
whose profits were pegged to the “burgeoning
mainland China market.”

261
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,199
And several of those companies were partly
owned

262
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,920
or created by the Chinese government.

263
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,059
In 2004, Newbridge Capital bought an 18% stake

264
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,230
in Shenzhen Development bank.

265
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,139
Now again, I’m not accusing Feinstein of
doing

266
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,779
anything that’s technically illegal.

267
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,320
In fact, as a senator,

268
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,939
she has to publicly disclose her assets.

269
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,089
But her friendship with Jiang,

270
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,829
and her husband’s business dealings in China,

271
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,639
are exactly the kinds of messy

272
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,179
financial and interpersonal connections

273
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,689
that the Chinese Communist Party loves to
exploit.

274
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:56,819
In recent years,

275
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,360
Feinstein seems to have carried on her tradition

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,850
of supporting the Chinese Communist Party.

277
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,839
In 2010, when Obama sold weapons to Taiwan
for its national defense,

278
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,779
she opposed it, calling it a “a substantial
irritant”

279
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,829
in the US relationship with China.

280
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:17,279
And in 2015, Feinstein opposed Senator Ted
Cruz’s bill

281
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,610
that would have renamed the street in front
of the Chinese embassy

282
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,269
after activist and Nobel Prize winner Liu
Xiaobo.

283
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,399
She said at the time,

284
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,230
“Unlike the senator from Texas,

285
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,360
I’ve had a long experience with the Chinese,

286
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,399
going back more than 30 years.

287
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,889
And I know what can convince them to move
toward a goal.”

288
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,480
Yes, I’m sure she does.

289
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
By the way, Feinstein, who is 85-years-old,

290
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,769
is running this November for her 5th term
as senator.

291
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,920
But Senator Feinstein is not the only US official

292
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,660
who has close ties with the Chinese Communist
Party.

293
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,579
She’s just one pawn in their larger game
of “elite capture”—

294
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,470
to influence politicians all over the world.

295
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,470
For example:

296
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,179
The mayor of Bristol in the UK, Marvin Rees,

297
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,739
seen here during an all-expenses paid trip

298
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,309
to the “sister city” of Guangzhou.

299
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:10,950
And former San Francisco mayor Ed Lee,

300
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,519
seen here raising the Chinese flag above San
Francisco City Hall.

301
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,380
And former Australian MP Sam Dastyari,

302
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,209
seen here speaking in opposition to Australia’s
foreign policy

303
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,480
in the South China Sea.

304
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,059
And current New Zealand MP Jian Yang

305
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,759
denying that he himself is a spy,

306
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,329
even though he once taught spies in China.

307
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,829
Now that’s what I call “elite capture.”

308
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:36,829
So what do you think about

309
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:39,679
the Chinese Communist Party’s strategy of
elite capture

310
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,620
and the history between Dianne Feinstein and
Jiang Zemin?

Leave your comments below.

312
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,100
And before you go,

313
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,149
now is the time when we answer questions from
fans of the show

314
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,709
who support China Uncensored on the crowdfunding
website Patreon.

315
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,860
Evan Marsh asks:

316
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,629
“What are the most dangerous countries to
be living in right now

317
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,689
near and around China?

318
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,399
By dangerous I mean danger from the communist
party

319
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,069
of china’s influence or potential military
threats.”

320
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,069
Good question, Evan.

321
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:09,999
In terms of military threats,

322
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,260
probably there’s no country that the Chinese
military

323
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,350
would openly attack right now.

324
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,439
Except possibly Taiwan,

325
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,459
which it’s been threatening to attack for
years.

326
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,959
But it would be pretty foolish for the Chinese
regime

327
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,309
to start World War III over it.

328
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:24,949
But in terms of influence,

329
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,920
any country that’s part of China’s Belt
and Road Initiative

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,250
is potentially a highway to the danger zone.

331
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,759
For countries that are geographically near
China,

332
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,610
there’s China’s communist neighbors:

333
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,230
Vietnam, Laos, and North Korea—

334
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,470
all of which arrest dissidents on a regular
basis.

335
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,079
And then there are countries like Cambodia
and Singapore,

336
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,910
which are free-ish countries,

337
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,029
but are under heavy influence from the Communist
Party.

338
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,790
So none of those are great places to live
if, say,

339
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,180
you practice Falun Gong.

340
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,949
But as a regular tourist,

341
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,499
as long as you stay out of politics and follow
the rules,

342
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,929
you’ll probably be fine.

343
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,339
Thanks for your question, Evan.

344
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:05,680
