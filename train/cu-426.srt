1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,600
Taiwan is under constant threat from China.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,759
Not just the military

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,720
But also infiltration in its democracy.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,180
How is Taiwan resisting?

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,330
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,390
Taiwan is on the front lines of a battle

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,029
with the Chinese Communist Party.

9
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,070
And few people understand that like DPP Legislator
Wang Ting-Yu.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,590
He’s Chairman of the legislature’s

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,929
Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee.

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,490
I sat down with him in Tainan

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,200
to discuss the tactics the Communist Party

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,320
is using to destroy democracy,

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,610
and how Taiwan can save the Indo-Pacific region

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,640
from a dangerous authoritarian state.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,400
Well, thank you for joining me today.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,780
Yes, thank you for your time.

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,930
Yeah, you bet.

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,710
So how is the Chinese Communist Party trying
to infiltrate Taiwan?

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,250
They try to do this for decades.

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,280
More than 40 years.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,230
And [inaudible] the technology development
they have new way

24
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,160
to do the old tricks.

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,570
For example, in Taiwan, they have three basic
tactics

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,420
to penetrate Taiwan society.

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,120
First using their economic power to seduce,

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,260
to lure Taiwanese businessmen,

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:33,380
become their investment and then using all
these economic condition

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,610
to tie the Taiwanese businessmen, making them
follow,

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,280
cherish the relationship with the communist.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,210
You need a relationship to do your business
in China.

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,060
Then you need to be a good friend.

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,220
You need to show your good will, step-by-step.

35
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,810
Then they can use,

36
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:02,010
inaudible] using the businessmen to influence
policy making.

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,470
Second way, they are using some we call psychological
warfare.

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,240
They are using their air force, navy, go around
Taiwan Island.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,810
It's not only try to shaking Taiwanese will,

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,350
try to show their muscle to block those help
from United States

41
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,840
in Guam Island or Okinawa and our neighborhood
country

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,040
and to try to tell Taiwan,

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
"Listen to us.

44
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,030
You can have the relationship to do business
to make money.

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,310
If you don't listen to us, listen to Chinese
communist,

46
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,260
you will face the missiles, you will face
the crisis,

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,292
all the possibilities to create a tiny war
that

48
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:58,410
will destroy your stock market, will influence
your life."

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,180
And the third away, is ongoing now and I'm
afraid maybe

50
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,489
they are doing this in all the democratic
country around the world.

51
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,310
They try to use in some they call education,

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,430
that using some literature, cultural engagement.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,780
Try to ask Taiwanese primary school, the deans,
the principals,

54
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,160
the students, come to China.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,640
The only thing you need is just buy the ticket.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,290
Everything they will take care of that.

57
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,510
It's interesting that some of these tactics
you're talking about,

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,970
because with some differences it does sound
very similar to things

59
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,709
the Chinese Communist Party is doing in the
United States as well.

60
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,420
They're doing that too.

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:55,090
For example, if your Capitol Hill try to pass
a law favor Taiwan,

62
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,709
maybe their ambassador will protest it himself,

63
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,860
but they will try to ask for some big company
in the United States,

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,580
try to influence your lawmakers, they're doing
that.

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,300
Sometimes they will buy advertisement in cable
TV,

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:20,469
try to create some kind of voice to interfere
democracy function,

67
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,030
because Chinese communist they know one thing.

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,059
In North Korea or China, this kind of country,

69
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,569
the head is the most important,

70
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,259
the leader, that one, dictator, Xi Jinping,
Kim Jong-Un.

71
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,590
They are the most important.

72
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,069
They are everything.

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,199
But in our country as a democracy country,

74
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,550
election by people, we create the power to
[inaudible],

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,509
to steal, to control this country.

76
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:58,249
So if you can influence the rule of the game
of election,

77
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,659
you will control democracy country.

78
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,669
So they tried, they know that.

79
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,099
So they tried using money to contribute,

80
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,509
donate some money to some certain guy,

81
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,530
tried to beat democracy by democracy way.

82
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,560
And I'm happy to observe these two years,
the United States,

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,129
Trump administration, Taiwan, Japan, Australia,
Canada,

84
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,849
they all notice this situation is quite serious.

85
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,699
We have a lot of plan and program.

86
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,619
We cooperate together since maybe two years
ago.

87
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,310
Well, it seems to me that if the rest of the
world

88
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,150
wants to understand what the Chinese Communist
Party is doing

89
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,150
in their own countries,

90
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,119
they really need to look at Taiwan.

91
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,119
Yeah.

92
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,129
Taiwan, we are in the front line.

93
00:05:52,129 --> 00:06:05,509
The cyber attack, through internet attack
our government,

94
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,710
attack our traffic control system, attack
our civil system.

95
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,719
Every month more than 45 million times.

96
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:19,719
Cyber attacked every month 45 million times.

97
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,860
That's insane.

98
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,529
And the content, disinformation attack,

99
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,219
each day almost 1 million.

100
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,219
Each day?

101
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,059
Each day, almost 1 million spread in [inaudible].

102
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,060
They are using VPN,

103
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,119
maybe send fake news or disinformation from
China,

104
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,349
but they will jump to Mexico,

105
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,729
then Mexico to Taiwan,

106
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,099
something like that.

107
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,419
And that amount create chaos,

108
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,009
especially during election.

109
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:58,270
They were manufacturing some half real, half
fake,

110
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:06,399
then totally fake, and through these [inaudible]
from [inaudible],

111
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,229
the inside of our country has [inaudible],

112
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,659
we call [inaudible] system.

113
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,270
We catch that, share that spread.

114
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,800
Then some TV station, mass media, they are
their allies, partners.

115
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,719
Using that kind of rumors, gossips, fake news,
become a true news,

116
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,030
broadcasting to TV then people will believe
in it.

117
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,559
Well, I know the Democratic Progressive Party

118
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,770
recently passed the anti-infiltration act.

119
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,560
What is that bill about?

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,589
We call it national security lawmaking process.

121
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,449
We have two major part.

122
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:55,990
The first major part is focused at spying
or military

123
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,069
or some similar warfare.

124
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,259
So we fix our crime law.

125
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,629
We made China, to become Chinese spy,

126
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:16,409
we put them on our crime law, is life sentence
to death penalty.

127
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,470
We increase the penalty.

128
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,830
And we fixed our national security law.

129
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,979
If you are helping Chinese communist

130
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,819
to develop their organization in Taiwan,

131
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,849
then before maybe only under two years,

132
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,030
now it's more than seven years to life sentence.

133
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,950
So, that law is especially focus at the spy
sabotage.

134
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,330
And then the second part is one we just passed.

135
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,080
This is, we call Democracy Protecting Law.

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,960
In a democratic, in a democracy society,

137
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,410
we encourage people to vote, to become a candidate,

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,360
to donate to a candidate you favor, to speak.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
You can have a parade.

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,490
You can have a demonstration on a street.

141
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,190
You can lobby, you can lobby for the law you
want.

142
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,130
You can sending out or receive all different
kinds of informations.

143
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,260
All this behavior is democracy itself.

144
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,120
We encourage them to do that.

145
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,270
But, if this normal democracy behavior got
polluted by your enemy,

146
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,760
do we need to forbid that?

147
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:50,040
In Taiwan we have law to regulate political
party,

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,560
military, and the government cannot own media.

149
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,570
You cannot own media.

150
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,200
Media must be owned by people,

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,040
cannot be political party, military or government.

152
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,380
We have struggled decades to establish this
law,

153
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,540
for about 10 years ago.

154
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,990
So if Taiwanese military, Taiwanese government,

155
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,960
Taiwanese party cannot own media,

156
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,130
can we allow our media owned by Chinese Communist
Party?

157
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,180
PLA?

158
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,270
Certainly not.

159
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,430
So we just passed a law.

160
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,780
We just regulate that behavior.

161
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,890
If you receive Chinese communist money, order,
authorization,

162
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,890
to donate to certain party or candidate

163
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,630
using their illegal money to interfere our
normal democratic behavior,

164
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,810
then you violate the law.

165
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,050
So that's sort of how the Chinese Communist
Party

166
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,860
uses democracy to undermine democracy.

167
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Yes.

168
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,030
We have observed this.

169
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,940
We try to establish a law system

170
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,000
but we don't want to choke the democracy itself

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,310
because the freedom and democracy is what
we are proud of.

172
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,680
That was Taiwan's [inaudible.]

173
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,220
So we can not have a law, otherwise we will
just become a North Korea.

174
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,460
That will be easier.

175
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,230
But we don't like that.

176
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,440
So we have a lot of debating,

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,120
arguing and using a lot of time.

178
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,640
Then we regulate five behavior.

179
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,830
This five behavior also authorized or sponsored
by Chinese communist,

180
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,050
by our foreign enemies, then you break law.

181
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,310
We have an example.

182
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,430
To drink alcohol it didn't break a law.

183
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,700
To drive a car, you don't break a law.

184
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,560
But if you drink alcohol and then drive a
car,

185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
you break a law.

186
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Something like this.

187
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,980
So if you are doing business with Chinese
communist,

188
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,910
even you get money from Chinese government.

189
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,190
Yeah, you didn't violate any law.

190
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,950
You become a [inaudible] candidate,

191
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,370
you donate money to some party or candidate,

192
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,940
you lobby for your law, your favorite,

193
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,550
you want to send in some information, and
it's okay.

194
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,010
But if you got ordered and get money then
to become a candidate

195
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,810
or to sponsor or to sabotage some demonstration,

196
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,940
parade or to spread some fake news, then you
break this law.

197
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,820
And according our [inaudible],

198
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,810
the majority of Taiwanese people support to
establish this

199
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,050
[inaudible] because they all worry about this.

200
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,750
Well I know there's been some pushback to
the anti-infiltration act f

201
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,100
rom Taiwan's other dominant political party,
the KMT.

202
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,920
Why is that?

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,780
KMT they are in...

204
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,040
To this law, they are in awkward position.

205
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,070
Voters, they say they want this law

206
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,840
because they know Taiwan need this.

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,930
Beijing doesn't.

208
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,550
Of course they don't want this law.

209
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,550
Obviously.

210
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,840
And KMT, Kuomintang,

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,150
they are China friendly party

212
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,370
and they have strong relationship and the
connection with China.

213
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,840
So they are in some awkward condition.

214
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,300
They want to win the election, they need votes,

215
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,990
but if they don't follow

216
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:46,380
or don't cooperate with their friends in Beijing,

217
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,800
maybe something bad will happen

218
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,990
because they have too many things in Communist
hands.

219
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:01,010
So as I recall that day we try to pass it
alone.

220
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,600
KMT, their legislator come inside to [inaudible],

221
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
sit on the ground, yell some slogan,

222
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,280
then put a mask on and keep silence for five
hours.

223
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,340
Then the law passed.

224
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,910
They didn't resist,

225
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,279
they didn't try to stop the lawmaking process,

226
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,950
but they are showing their attitude that they
don't like this law.

227
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,210
But they know if they using physical conflict
to stop the law,

228
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,990
they will lose the trust of voters.

229
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,430
So democracy.

230
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,350
Democracy win.

231
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,130
Yeah.

232
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,730
So as chairman of the foreign affairs and
national defense committee,

233
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,910
what are some other national defense issues

234
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,300
you think the Taiwan government should be
concerned about?

235
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:03,460
This is a big question because we have a lot
of thing need to catch up with.

236
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,460
In Indo-Pacific or Oriental Asia, there are
four potential crisis.

237
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,530
These four potential crises,

238
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:21,230
if something bad happened will kill the economy
globally.

239
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,320
North Korea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait,
and the South China Sea.

240
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,540
These four potential crises,

241
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,050
not only influence the regional politics

242
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,720
but also influence the global economy,

243
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,170
and Taiwan plays important role in three of
these four.

244
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,830
So we have a lot of discussion with the United
States.

245
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,150
I always told my friend in Capitol Hill, I
say,

246
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,480
"Once Taiwan secured then the Pacific will
be secured.

247
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,310
Once Taiwan stabilized, this region will be
stabilized."

248
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,529
So how to stabilize it.

249
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,880
We Taiwanese, we know this country is my home.

250
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,240
The only one has a responsibility to protect
Taiwan is ourself.

251
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,460
We cannot rely on Americans or the other friends.

252
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,910
Friends can help, but we need to depend on
ourselves.

253
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:29,390
And what we need, we don't have enough high
technology weapon.

254
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,380
Since 2013 PLA, Chinese People's Liberation...

255
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,470
Army.

256
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,760
They have modernized their equipment.

257
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:47,100
They put a lot of money in their air force
power and the naval power.

258
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,620
They want to be a world superpower.

259
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,650
We want to defend our home.

260
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,890
It's different kind of strategy consideration.

261
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,510
We don't need to build Taiwan so big to against
China.

262
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:05,220
We just need enough power to protect Taiwan

263
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,199
and to fulfill our responsibility in East
China Sea, Taiwan Strait,

264
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,390
and the South China Sea.

265
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,079
We own the largest Island in South China Sea.

266
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,839
We have, I cannot give you detailed figures,

267
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,019
we have hundreds of our young men and woman
posted in South China Sea.

268
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,230
So we need underwater equipment like submarine

269
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,350
and we are building it on our own.

270
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,370
And I do believe we, from now on, within three
years,

271
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,509
we will have the first made by Taiwan, most
modernized submarine.

272
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:49,840
I believe so.

273
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,429
And since our friends help we are going to
have the first M1A2T,

274
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,740
the battle tank.

275
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,379
What my army using...

276
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:04,539
The tank we are using now, is 40 years ago.

277
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,230
World War II.

278
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:14,139
And after 20 years we've eventually we got
the F-16 V,

279
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:19,149
so this is [inaudible], and the past three
years

280
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,519
we have new regulation and a new pension system.

281
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,990
We increase the military,

282
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,210
those young men and women, we increase their
payment.

283
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,129
We increase their retired pension,

284
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:38,490
so try to stabilize our military.

285
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,529
So this is insights to strengthen our own
power and using Taiwanese

286
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,450
we have some strengths under control.

287
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,940
We built a lot made in Taiwan weapon system
to protect our seashore,

288
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,379
something like that.

289
00:18:54,379 --> 00:19:00,919
But for DPP, in the future, for the coming
four years,

290
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,590
what we need or actually what this region
need,

291
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,779
because if you believe Taiwan stabilized,

292
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,909
then you can stabilize this region,

293
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,909
what our need is, we need more opportunity

294
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,549
to cooperate with our international friends.

295
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:24,039
Well, so what would you like to see happen

296
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,929
as far as US-Taiwan relations?

297
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,960
Maybe invite Taiwan to join RIMPAC.

298
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,519
You know RIMPAC is a military exercise.

299
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,269
Nothing big deal, but in Asia, Taiwan and
North Korea

300
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,860
are the only two countries never got invited.

301
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,809
Taiwan and North Korea.

302
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,809
Those two countries usually aren't mentioned
in the same sentence.

303
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:56,210
But now United States, they cancel the invitation
to China last time.

304
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,860
So I hope this year,

305
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,690
every two years they have a RIMPAC military
exercise.

306
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,429
I hope we can got invite.

307
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,230
It's kind of simple.

308
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,320
It's also real.

309
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,980
It means we are partners.

310
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,440
We are in the system.

311
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,950
Once the system strong enough, the conflict
will not happen,

312
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,419
or will happen only in [inaudible] situation.

313
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:33,620
All the power they got even, unless situation,

314
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,890
the crisis, only crisis that wont happen.

315
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,710
Some serious conflict.

316
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:44,629
So for the 2020 I do believe we will have
more opportunity

317
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:47,700
to have some special occasion.

318
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,279
Our young military, young men, young ladies,

319
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,600
can have the opportunity to train with United
States armies.

320
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,789
And maybe according to the United States,

321
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:04,059
MDAA or Taiwan Travel Act, yeah,

322
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:10,320
you can send some kind of a ship, come to
Taiwan,

323
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,489
mercy medical ship, not battleship.

324
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:18,869
Try to using this kind of hint to tell someone,

325
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,649
"Don't do something stupid.

326
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,269
You cannot afford it."

327
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,240
So if we keep sending this message,

328
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,139
"Don't do something stupid, you cannot afford
it."

329
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:36,950
Now that will be very good strategy to stabilize
Indo-Pacific,

330
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,620
make this place become a democracy

331
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,379
and a friend and allies and that the economy
can be keep prosperous.

332
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:53,940
So what the signal we need, you need to not
bilateral discuss,

333
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,600
and we are working on that,

334
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,360
hoping it's going to happen in this year.

335
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,140
Thank you for joining me today.

336
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,800
Yeah, it's [inaudible].

337
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,860
Thank you.
