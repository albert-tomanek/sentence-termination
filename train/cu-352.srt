00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,030
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,140
you’re princess isn’t in another castle.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,540
She’s been kidnapped by...

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,160
Chinese censors.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,279
Video games makers are no strangers to censorship.

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,739
The very first controversial video game came in 1976.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,699
The arcade game Death Race,

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,199
where you run over “gremlins” in your
car.

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,659
Barbaric.

11
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,849
And of course, it only got worse from there.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,079
I think I’m going to be sick.

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,719
Now there are a lot of different opinions

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,100
about the degree to which video games should
or shouldn’t be censored

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,000
mainly over the level of violence.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,359
But now China has taken video game censorship to a
whole new level.

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,519
For years, the Chinese regime had banned video
game consoles.

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,499
Although that ban has now been lifted—restrictions
apply.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,380
But it’s left a void that allowed a flourishing
mobile game market.

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,960
The biggest in the world, in fact.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,250
In 2015, that market was worth 7 billion dollars,

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,210
with 400 million gamers consuming

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,440
10,000 games released that year alone.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,140
That’s about 27 new games a day.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,750
But this is about to be a thing of the past.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,960
As of this month,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,540
Chinese censors will need to approve every
mobile game before it’s released.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,890
Games that are already released

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,560
will have to retroactively get approval before
an October deadline.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,390
The government organ in charge of this is

31
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,290
the State Administration of Press, Publication,
Radio, Film and Television.

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,570
And now apparently games?

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,900
SAPPRFTG?

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,340
They really need to work on those acronyms.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,080
Anyway, the guidelines allow the Chinese authorities

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,460
to ban pretty much any game they want.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,900
For example, some developers in China

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,220
have reported their games got canned

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,150
because they contained English words.

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,050
Not politically charged words.

41
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,560
Pointless video game words

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,710
like “mission start” and “warning.”

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,920
Others have reported similar problems

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,490
with games containing traditional Chinese
characters

45
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,040
that’s what they use in Hong Kong and Taiwan,

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
but not the Mainland.

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,390
Doesn’t stop there.

48
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,360
The Cyberspace Administration of China

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,130
is the agency responsible for censorship and
control over China’s Internet.

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,900
Starting August 1st,

51
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,040
mobile app developers will be required

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,340
to give users’ personal information to the
agency.

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,880
That’s crazy!

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,140
I much prefer to voluntarily give all my information
up.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,120
But this isn’t just about censorship.

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,740
It’s also about business.

57
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,990
And this is going to kill the indie game scene
in China.

58
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,290
The mobile game market in China is super competitive.

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,030
According to one developer interviewed by
Sixth Tone,

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,610
“If you’re lucky a game will make you
1,500 yuan.”

61
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,250
That’s about 200 bucks.

62
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,510
But getting your new game approved can cost
over 2,000.

63
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,350
Why so much?

64
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,030
Well, for one, don’t expect the censors
to download your game.

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,200
They don’t have time!

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,730
You, the developer, have to send them a phone

67
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,520
with an active sim card and data plan,

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,550
and your game pre-installed.

69
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,250
Two phones if you’re publishing on iOS and
Android.

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,050
It’s a pretty sweet gig, being a Chinese
censor.

71
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,110
It also can take up to 3 months to get your
game approved.

72
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,340
If you’re an indie developer, working alone,

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,690
investing your own money into a project,

74
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,310
that’s a long wait for a return on investment.

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,250
That is, if everything works smoothly.

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,440
This basically means most indie game makers
won’t be able to survive.

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,340
Instead, they’ll get stomped on

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,720
—like proverbial goombas—

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,849
by big corporations like Tencent and Netease,

80
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,880
companies with close ties to the government.

81
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,020
Now these new restrictions don’t apply to
foreign game makers.

82
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,959
They were taken care of back in February.

83
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,360
Foreign companies are required to work with
domestic content providers.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,330
And they now need to get approval from...

85
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,880
SAPPRFT...

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,020
for online publication of any “creative
works.”

87
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,250
Wait, so does that mean

88
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,329
they don’t need approval if their games
aren’t very creative?

89
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,719
There might be a future for Great Giana Sisters
after all!

90
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,099
So what do you think about the future of gaming
in China?

91
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,080
Is there room for a sequel?

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,039
Or will it be game over?

93
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,779
Leave your comments below.

94
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,819
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

95
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,600
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.
