1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,259
Chinese tourists behaving badly.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,119
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,009
Now you may have heard that Chinese tourists

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,950
do not have the most sparkling of reputations.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,300
But good news everyone!

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,550
I was checking out the state-run CCTV’s Facebook page.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,030
You know, the one that would be banned inside
China.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,960
And it turns out,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,030
China National Tourism Administration has
laid out,

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,489
“nine kinds of misbehavior sufficiently
serious,”

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,960
to get a person put on the tourism blacklist.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,870
That means potentially no leaving China for
2-5 years!

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,579
Yes, they may prevent their own citizens from
leaving China for behaving badly!

15
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,579
So here are the 9 things Chinese tourists
are forbidden from doing.

16
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,429
Number 9

17
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,449
Interfering with aircraft or public transport

18
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,420
Like in March when a man opened the emergency
door

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,870
to get some fresh air while waiting for takeoff.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,620
Or when one guy deployed the slide so he could
get off the plane quicker.

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,290
That cost 15,000 dollars to fix.

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,490
In fact, in the first 6 months of 2015 alone,

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,220
this happened 15 times.

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,780
Number 8

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,740
Damaging public facilities

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,320
Like poor poor Shanghai Disneyland.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,020
A month before it even opened,

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,990
thousands of tourists trashed the grounds,

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,130
stomped the gardens,

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,910
umm, did other stuff

31
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,890
and clearly did not stay on the path.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,670
Number 7

33
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,780
Offending local traditions, cultures or living
habits

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,330
So Malaysia is a mostly Muslim country,

35
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,390
and it has a...

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,240
conservative view about nudity.

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,160
For example, when four foreigners stripped
naked

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,270
on the top of the sacred Mount Kinabalu,

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,670
they were blamed for the earthquake the killed
16 people just a few days after.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,850
So it was maybe a bad idea that this group
of Chinese tourists

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,840
took all these nude photos on a Malaysian
beach.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
Number 6

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Destroying cultural and historical relics

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,950
Now, I can’t read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics,

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,210
but I’m pretty sure this didn’t originally
say “Ding Jinhao was here”.

46
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,120
Yes, in the ancient Luxor temple,

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,890
the one in Egypt, not Las Vegas,

48
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,880
a teenaged Chinese tourist carved his name
on the wall.

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
Number 5

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,310
Participating in gambling, prostitution or
drug use

51
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,850
Well what’s the point of even being on vacation
then?!

52
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,100
Dongguan has earned the nickname “capital
of sex” in China.

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,830
Where people travel specifically to participate

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,450
in gambling, prostitution or drug use.

55
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,280
In 2014, authorities led a massive prostitution
bust.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,510
They arrested 67 people and shut down 12 brothels.

57
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,510
This one has the

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,599
“I can see you on the toilet from my uncomfortable
bed” theme going on.

59
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,240
Number 4

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,700
Threatening the public safety

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,890
This image speaks for itself.

62
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,380
That’s a gun.

63
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,849
On an airplane.

64
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,060
It's probably fake,

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,770
but since people have now been escorted off
planes for doing math,

66
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,709
this is still a bad idea.

67
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,360
Number 3

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,110
Damaging the ecosystem and breaking wildlife
protection regulations

69
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,930
Nanjing is known for its beautiful cherry
blossoms.

70
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,239
They look especially nice when people shake
off all the petals

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,739
so they can take a nice photo.

72
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,610
Though, I do have to say,

73
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,970
climbing that tree in those heels is pretty
darn impressive.

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,739
Number 2

75
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,030
Perpetuating “low-taste or superstitious”
ideas.

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,860
Well, these tourists are certainly being superstitious

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,640
And finally number 1

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,650
Other behavior that causes a negative impact

79
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,520
Ah how wonderfully vague.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
I wonder if defecating in public counts?

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,459
But before you start filling up the comment
section

82
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,640
with hate speech about Chinese people, think
about this:

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,130
You don’t really have this problem with
people from Taiwan.

84
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,840
Or Hong Kong.

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,199
This happens in a society where the Chinese
Communist Party

86
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,500
has spent 60 years ruining traditional culture
and values

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,510
so they could establish their own ideology.

88
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,810
In fact, among these things that the Chinese
government

89
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,169
is telling its tourists not to do,

90
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,550
are things the government specifically told
them to do

91
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,570
just a couple generations ago.

92
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,150
Like destroying cultural relics.

93
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,070
Smashing public property.

94
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,650
And disrespecting local traditions.

95
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,330
So, really, how much of the blame should we
really put on Chinese people?

96
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,040
And if you want to learn more about how the
Chinese Communist Party

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,290
specifically destroyed Chinese culture, watch
this video.

98
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,210
So what do you think of the Chinese Tourism
Administration’s prohibitions?

99
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,460

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,000
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
