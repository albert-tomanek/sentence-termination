00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:02,109
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,780
China is years ahead of America.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,950
And I don't mean its glistening skyscrapers
or high-speed rails.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,370
I mean its plan to stop crime before it happens.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,100
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,670
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,920
Good news everyone!

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,820
In a world laboring under the shadow of terrorism,

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,360
China has the answer.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,320
And don't worry, this is definitely not an
idea torn from the pages

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,710
of some Philip K. Dick dystopian sci-fi story.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,589
To understand it,

13
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:37,920
let's take a look at a movie based on

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,309
a Philip K. Dick dystopian sci-fi story.

15
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:44,920
“Mr. Marks, by mandate of the District of
Columbia Precrime Division,

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm placing you under arrest for the future
murder of Sarah Marks.”

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,469
In the movie Minority Report,

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,249
crime is stopped before it happens,

19
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:57,559
because it's predicted by three "precogs."

20
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,519
This is called "precrime."

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,479
"Precrime: it works.

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,629
It works.

23
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:02,789
It works.

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:03,949
It works.

25
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,869
It works.

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,260
"Precrime: it works!

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,240
On Tuesday, April 22,

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,180
vote yes on the national precrime initiative."

29
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,050
Obviously that's science fiction,

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,190
and not what's happening in China.

31
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,550
China wouldn't let people vote.

32
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,800
Seriously, they are planning to create precrime,
though.

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,020
China is already a surveillance state.

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,260
The Communist Party monitors every aspect
of every citizen's life.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,340
Here's China Uncensored Precrime expert Harold
Finch on how it works.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,580
“The government gave itself the power to
read every email,

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,930
listen to every cell phone,

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,560
but they needed something to sort through
it all,

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,070
something that could pick the terrorists out

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,700
of the general population before they could
act.”

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,590
Oh wait, sorry,

42
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,470
that's from the fictional TV drama Person
of Interest.

43
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,790
My mistake.

44
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,860
I'm really having a hard time separating

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,530
fictional plot devices from Communist Party
policy.

46
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,190
So you see, the Chinese government can already
gain access

47
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,410
to anyone's bank accounts and tap their phones.

48
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,360
They have an army of Internet watchdogs that

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,439
dog your every click.

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,099
They monitor people's online activity

51
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,340
and give them a score on their "trustworthiness"—

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,469
the "social credit" system.

53
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,640
Then there's the massive nationwide network

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,870
of surveillance cameras China calls Skynet.

55
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,040
Wait, that can't be right.

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,920
Skynet was the name of the AI computer network
in the Terminator movies—

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,700
the one that wiped out humanity.

58
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,609
What's that Shelley?

59
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,499
Ok, China is actually calling it Skynet.

60
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,219
Wow.

61
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,159
I think it might be time to cancel the Communist
Party's Netflix subscription.

62
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,900
Anyway, China is collecting huge amounts of
information on its citizens.

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,879
But they also need to sort through it

64
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,069
and figure out how to use it to prevent crime.

65
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,200
So can they?

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,139
Well, that's where the China Electronics Technology
comes in.

67
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,579
They're one of China's largest state-owned
defense contractors.

68
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,319
They've been given the job to, as Bloomberg
puts it,

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,849
“Develop software to collate data on jobs,

70
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,840
hobbies, consumption habits, and other

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,230
behavior of ordinary citizens to predict

72
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,219
terrorist acts before they occur.”

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,980
Is this even possible?

74
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,389
Well, a recent research paper by mathematicians
at

75
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,099
University College London suggests that with
enough data,

76
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,029
patterns of behavior emerge that you can use

77
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:29,239
to predict certain terrorist acts.

78
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,760
So anyone who engages in suspicious or dangerous
behavior,

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,049
such as using a VPN to jump the Great Firewall
of China,

80
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,980
and look up information on known terrorist
ringleader

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,489
the Dalai Lama,

82
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,090
might find themselves "invited to tea" with
authorities.

83
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,959
Did I mention is this is for fighting terrorism,

84
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,950
and absolutely not for clamping down on dissent?

85
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,730
The government would definitely not use it
to, say,

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,499
predict anti-government protests,

87
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,010
and send in the police before they begin.

88
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,540
Because China's constitution guarantees freedom
of

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,430
speech, and the press, and assembly.

90
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,939
Now a lot about this precrime program remains
unknown to the outside world,

91
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,359
and to the Chinese people—

92
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,760
including when it will be put in effect.

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,239
And while other countries are trying to create
similar programs,

94
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,009
China's program is likely to be more successful.

95
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,139
According to their definition of success,
at least.

96
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,050
That's because the Party doesn't have to worry
about pesky things like

97
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,680
rule of law, or public approval,

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,550
or people protesting massive surveillance.

99
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,919
And with so much data, it might actually be
possible

100
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,830
to have something that approaches pre-crime.

101
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,970
So what do you think about China's new system?

102
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,509
Leave your comments below.

103
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:40,919
Once again I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,300
"Chris Chappell, you are under arrest for
the future subversion of state power!"

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
"Future subversion?"
