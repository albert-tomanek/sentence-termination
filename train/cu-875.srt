00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,149
can you trust vaccines?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,700
Well, if you’re in China, maybe not.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,970
Vaccines: a life saving technological breakthrough?

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,390
Or poison injected into your children?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,970
If you'd like save time,

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,039
you can go ahead and begin

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,009
the anti-vaxxer flame war in the comment section
below.

10
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,169
Still here? Good.

11
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,840
Let's talk about a vaccine scandal!

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,250
Chinese pharmacist Pang Hongwei had been illegally
trading in vaccines.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,540
But authorities were quick to act and she
was sentenced to three years in prison,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,110
later reduced to five years probation.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,020
That was in 2009.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,150
But then in 2011,

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,400
instead of stopping her illegal vaccine trade,

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,000
she somehow began working with local officials
in 24 provinces,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,890
for five years, creating one of the biggest
health scandals in Chinese history.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,470
I wonder if that violates the terms of her
probation.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,030
As of now, this $90 million dollar scandal
has exposed

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,400
29 pharmaceutical firms, 16 health departments
and 357 officials.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,780
Here's how it worked:

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,370
According to China's FDA,

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,510
Pang was buying cheap vaccines

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,229
from drug companies that were either expired
or close to their expiration date.

27
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,780
Then she sold them across China.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,260
And local officials cooperated—for a profit.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,909
See, local governments don’t get money from
the central government,

30
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,720
so they're often forced to come up with some…creative
ways

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,010
to make money, like:

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,610
land seizures, fines for violations of the
one (and now two) child policy, and selling vaccines.

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,119
Provincial disease control centers mark up
the vaccines

34
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,960
and then force hospitals to buy them.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,250
And while some vaccines for diseases like
polio and tuberculosis

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,790
are considered mandatory for everyone and
are free

37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,560
others, like for chickenpox or meningitis,
Chinese citizens have to buy themselves.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,990
Now if you think this whole local government-backed
monopoly

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,810
on expired or nearly expired vaccines could
go on forever,

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,700
well, it didn't.

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,099
It only went on for five years.

42
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,770
That’s when police stumbled upon Pang's
stash of vaccines

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,660
in an unrefrigerated storeroom in an abandoned
factory.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,410
Apparently vaccines are supposed to be refrigerated.

45
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,590
So for five years, people across China were
paying for vaccines

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,140
that were expired and weren't stored properly.

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,580
Now while that may sound bad,

48
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,290
what’s even worse is that officials covered
up the scandal for an entire year.

49
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,380
In fact, the only reason it came to light

50
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,860
is that authorities asked suppliers in March
to step forward

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,900
so they could trace potential victims.

52
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,700
In other words, they were afraid the problem
might become too big to cover up,

53
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,320
so they decided to 'fess up.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Just like they did with SARS.

55
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,840
So you might be asking yourself…

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,960
"Won't someone please think of the children."

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Well…

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,090
"I felt very scared and worried about my child
after I heard this news."

59
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,459
So is there a risk of getting poisoned from
expired vaccines?

60
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,020
According to the World Health Organization…

61
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,150
"This is not the case.

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,220
Vaccines that are improperly handled can lose
their potency

63
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,040
and they may not protect the child against
the disease the vaccine was intended to prevent."

64
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,840
So you can see why authorities covered it
up for a year.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
There was nothing to worry about!

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
Expired vaccines just lose their potency.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,980
They don’t kill you.

68
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,489
Unless you die from the disease they’re
supposed to protect you against

69
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,019
because you never got a real vaccination.

70
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,239
As for Pang, she’s been detained,

71
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,900
but police haven't announced any specific
charges,

72
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,880
because, you know, not telling people things
has worked out so great in the past.

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,220
But some say that if courts feel they've endangered
lives,

74
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,900
they could face the death sentence.

75
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,120
The Chinese people already don’t have much
faith in Chinese goods,

76
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,079
from all the fake medicine, fake food, toxic
milk, or that time in 2013

77
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,209
when a couple of infants died following a
Hepatitis B vaccination

78
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,560
but the Chinese FDA said it was unrelated

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
but who really believes what the Chinese government
says anyway?

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,880
And this five-year-long-scandal-plus-one-year-cover-up
has not helped.

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,710
Doctors in China are already reporting a big
drop-off in vaccinations across the country.

82
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,000
So what do you think about vaccines?

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
What’s that, Shelley?

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,460
You’re saying it’s a bad idea to ask viewers
to comment on that?

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,650
Well, in that case, what do you... love most
about puppy dogs?

86
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,600
