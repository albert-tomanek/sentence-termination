bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
I don t think Chinese feminists understand

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:12,519
what feminism means Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,
I'm Chris Chappell. Does the perfect man exist?

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,630
Maybe he does, but why on earth would he want
to marry you? That s the advice China s Women

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,320
s Federation is offering to what they call
the leftover women, women who have spent too

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,480
much time getting an education, not enough
time finding a hubby, and have now reached

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,580
the unmarriageable age of 27. Now before you
get offended, keep in mind, the way they calculate

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,219
age is a little different in China so really,
by US calculation, they mean 26. Again, this

8
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,239
comes from China s state feminist agency,
the All-China Women s Federation, which was

9
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,370
founded in 1949 to protect women s rights
and interests. Aww, look at them. They coined

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,219
the term leftover women in 2007 with articles
like Overcoming the Big Four Emotional Blocks:

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,479
Leftover Women Can Break out of Being Single,
and, Eight Simple Moves to Escape the Leftover

12
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,190
Women Trap. China s Ministry of Education
has even added the term to its official lexicon

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,210
Here s a taste. I have to thank Times Contributor
LETA HONG FINCHER for finding this gem from

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,960
2011. Pretty girls don t need a lot of education
to marry into a rich and powerful family,

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,740
but girls with an average or ugly appearance
will find it difficult. These kinds of girls

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,180
hope to further their education in order to
increase their competitiveness. The tragedy

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,649
is, they don t realize that as women age,
they are worth less and less, so by the time

18
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:32,560
they get their M.A. or Ph.D., they are already
old, like yellowed pearls. And these are the

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,052
feminists! I mean this stuff sounds like some
nightmare version of Cosmo or some of the

20
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:41,619
more painful writing on Mad Men. Now, I know
what you re probably thinking, boy, do I hate

21
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,259
leftover women. Well according to the Women
s Federation, you should. They just spend

22
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,610
their nights going to clubs for one-night
stands, becoming mistresses to rich officials.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,040
It is only when they have lost their youth
and are kicked out by the man, that they decide

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,700
to look for a life partner. Therefore, most
leftover women do not deserve our sympathy.

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,170
But to all my lady viewers, which according
to Youtube analytics I have none, even if

26
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,510
you get married, your job s not done. Say
one day you find out your husband s having

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,110
an affair. Don t get mad at him. It s your
fault. You should probably get a new haircut

28
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,659
or something. No man is capable of spending
a lifetime being loyal to an outmoded wife

29
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,370
who never changes. At this point I would just
like to say I m totally capable of spending

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,840
a lifetime being loyal to an outmoded wife
and I think 27 is a beautiful age. (wink)
