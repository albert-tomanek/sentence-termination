00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,070
The Malaysian Prime Minister

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,820
warns the Philippines

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,620
About bad Chinese Money

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,290
Is this the beginning of a new era

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,520
in the South China Sea?

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:16,500
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:17,540
I’m Chris Chappell.

The Philippines.

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,590
One of my favorite places in Southeast Asia.

15
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,990
Mostly because of the food.

16
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,120
Last week,

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,150
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad

18
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,480
made a state visit to The Philippines.

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,710
“We also discussed on economic matters

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,860
the trade between both countries are increasing,

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,620
but they are largely in favor of Malaysia.

22
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,140
I believe there is still room for improvement

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,780
and from my meeting with Mr. President (Rodrigo
Duterte),

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,790
we would encourage private sectors from both
countries

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,100
to explore opportunities of collaboration
and venture

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,530
in new cooperation and investments.”

27
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,370
But while Mahathir was trying to warm ties

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,610
between Malaysia and the Philippines,

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,440
he had a word of warning about another country—China.

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,049
Speaking to a Filipino news network, Mahathir
said,

31
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,479
“If you borrow huge sums of money from China,

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,420
and then you cannot pay,

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,990
when the person is a borrower

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,030
he is under the control of the lender.

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,840
So, we have to be very careful about that.”

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,010
I’m sure he wasn’t talking about any borrower
in particular.

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,979
He just said, “Countries *like* the Philippines

38
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,730
should ‘regulate or limit influences from
China.’”

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,850
You know, so these borrowers don’t get Sri
Lanka’d.

40
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,450
See, in 2008, Sri Lanka began construction

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,990
of a deep water container port,

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,840
funded by Chinese loans.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,100
Ten years later,

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,240
when Sri Lanka couldn’t pay the loans back,

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,670
China forced Sri Lanka

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,009
to give them the port on a 99-year lease.

47
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,870
A port that could someday become an ideal
naval base.

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,390
To be used against no country in particular.

49
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,280
How does Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,730
know so much about the Chinese regime

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,160
using debt to trap other countries into making
bad deals—

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,510
that is, “debt trap diplomacy”?

53
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,230
Well, Malaysia was almost a victim of it.

54
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,260
Malaysia’s previous Prime Minister—

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,620
who was massively corrupt, by the way—

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,080
secured $34 billion dollars worth of

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,099
Chinese-funded infrastructure projects.

58
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,550
Those included a Chinese state-owned company

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,380
buying a 40% stake

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,989
in a deep water shipping port near Kuantan.

61
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,970
The Communist Party does love its ports.

62
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,830
It was going to be a key part of

63
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,550
the Chinese Communist Party’s Belt and Road
Initiative.

64
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,330
That’s a global network of trade routes

65
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,860
and infrastructure projects that China is
creating,

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,880
and that basically drive debt trap diplomacy.

67
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,210
Or as the Chinese state-run media likes to
call it,

68
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,000
win-win cooperation.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,940
Because no matter what happens,

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,230
China wins!

71
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,989
Until Mahathir Mohamad took the 2018 election

72
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,520
in his own surprise win.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,590
That happened after the massive corruption

74
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,159
of the previous Prime Minister had been exposed.

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,430
Corruption that the Chinese regime

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,800
had agreed to help him cover up,

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,350
in exchange for Belt and Road deals.

78
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,590
What’s a few billion dollars between friends?

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,580
Well, a few billion dollars

80
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,319
plus illegally spying on journalists.

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,930
Unsurprisingly, Mahathir made Chinese infrastructure

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,849
projects and influence a key issue in his
campaign.

83
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,980
“None of our people are employed as workers.

84
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,860
None of our companies are used for designing

85
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,840
and planning and supervising, et cetera.

86
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,920
We gain nothing.”

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,349
And since Mahathir took office,

88
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,159
he has been negotiating or canceling

89
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,080
what he thinks are unfair Chinese infrastructure
deals.

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,290
For example, he’s renegotiated a $20 billion
dollar rail link.

91
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,859
And completely scrapped Chinese-backed oil
and gas pipelines.

92
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,419
That was a big hiccup in the Chinese regime’s

93
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,050
plans for control of Southeast Asia.

94
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,270
And now Mahathir is encouraging

95
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,729
Philippine president Duterte to do the same.

96
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,050
Kind of like your friend warning you

97
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,029
against dating his crazy ex.

98
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,849
But how many of us actually listen to that
friend?

99
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,639
Before Duterte was elected in 2016,

100
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,089
China and the Philippines had been in a standoff

101
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,809
over territorial disputes in the South China
Sea.

102
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:50,599
But Duterte decided to set those disputes
aside.

103
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,419
Instead, he focused on an ambitious 180 billion
dollar project

104
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,669
he creatively called “Build, Build, Build.”

105
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,580
But the problem was money money money.

106
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,090
And that opened the door to Chinese investment.

107
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,050
“In 2016, Duterte secured $24 billion in
investment,

108
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,539
credit and loan pledges

109
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,289
from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government

110
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,759
to upgrade his country’s infrastructure.”

111
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,539
According to the London-based think tank Capital
Economics,

112
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,550
corruption problems are a part of Chinese
investments,

113
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,029
and the Philippines already has a trade imbalance

114
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,759
approaching unsustainable levels—

115
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,229
meaning it imports way more than it exports.

116
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,650
And so Mahathir told Duterte, you know,

117
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,580
countries who take out big Chinese loans,

118
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,379
I’m not naming names here,

119
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,289
but maybe they should be careful.

120
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,889
Fortunately for The Philippines,

121
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,009
China has been a bit slow about making good
on

122
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,689
that 24 billion dollars they pledged

123
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,860
to upgrade infrastructure.

124
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,669
And the Philippine Finance Secretary says

125
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,910
the Philippines will definitely, never ever

126
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,819
get caught in a Chinese debt trap.

127
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,610
I mean sure, it happened to Sri Lanka,

128
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,929
Pakistan, Montenegro, The Maldives,

129
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,870
Djibouti and a bunch of other countries,

130
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,099
but it will never happen to the Philippines!

131
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,870
That’s true...if they don’t take too much
Chinese money.

132
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,069
Either way, though, there’s another aspect
of

133
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,120
the Chinese regime’s debt trap diplomacy

134
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,869
Mahathir also warned about —

135
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:21,530
too many Chinese workers.

136
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,610
He said, “Foreign direct investment

137
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,050
should not involve bringing huge numbers

138
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,950
of foreigners to live in the country

139
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,639
because that might disturb

140
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,270
the political equations in the country.”

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,270
In other words,

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,270
these foreigners are taking our jobs!

143
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
Somehow it sounds so different

144
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,770
coming out of the mouth of a 93-year-old doctor.

145
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,080
Since Duterte took office in 2016,

146
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,389
somewhere between 2 and 3 hundred thousand

147
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,979
Chinese workers have come to the Philippines.

148
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,629
The population has basically tripled.

149
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,879
Chinese nationals now get more than

150
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,830
half the working visas granted by the Philippines,

151
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,319
and the majority of special work permits.

152
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,379
And a lot of them work in online casinos.

153
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,150
Which is...a very interesting career choice.

154
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,150
Plus, a lot of Chinese workers

155
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,550
are in the Philippines illegally.

156
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,889
Recently the government has been

157
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,259
conducting mass raids.

158
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,259
And Mahathir said,

159
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,189
“If huge numbers of any foreigners

160
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,149
come to live and stay in the country

161
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,490
or even to influence economy,

162
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,680
then you have to do some rethinking,

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,690
whether it is good or bad or the limits

164
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,360
that we have to impose on them.”

165
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,270
You know, any foreigners,

166
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,759
not from any country in particular.

167
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,649
But for China, Mahathir threw a major wrench

168
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,610
in the communist regime’s plan

169
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,439
to use debt trap diplomacy in Malaysia.

170
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,529
And if he’s now becoming a rallying point

171
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,270
for other southeast Asian nations

172
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,999
to abandon China’s version of so-called

173
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:46,179
“win-win cooperation,”

174
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,249
it might just become a lose-lose scenario

175
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,360
for the Chinese Communist Party.

176
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Which I’m torn about,

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,300
because I don’t believe in no-win scenarios.

178
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,710
But Mahathir didn’t stop at economics.

179
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,229
He also called out China’s territorial claims

180
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,339
in the South China Sea.

181
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,689
Trillions of dollars of shipping goes through
it,

182
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,520
along with untapped oil and natural gas deposits.

183
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,669
China claims basically all of it.

184
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,990
Obviously that competes with claims

185
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,289
by both the Philippines and Malaysia.

186
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,650
As I’ve said, Duterte has mostly backed
down,

187
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,439
even though the Philippines had the strongest
claim

188
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,889
after a ruling from the Hague

189
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,719
rejected China’s claim in favor of theirs.

190
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,150
But while Mahathir was in the Philippines,

191
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,639
he said China should define its so-called

192
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,970
ownership of the South China Sea.

193
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,389
While also saying he’d be totally fine with
China’s claims,

194
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,459
as long as they basically take no action on
it.

195
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,459
But somehow,

196
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,669
I don’t imagine the Chinese Communist Party

197
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,449
will be too agreeable about owning something

198
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,880
without controlling it.

199
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,019
They’re not great at letting go.

200
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:47,519
Just ask Hong Kong.

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,379
So, what do you think of

202
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,879
Mahathir’s message to the Philippines?

203
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,319
Leave your comments below.

204
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,319
And before you go,

205
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,209
now is the time I answer a question

206
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,790
from a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army—

207
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,370
fans who support the show with a dollar or
more per episode

208
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,269
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

209
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,699
Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe asks,

210
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,600
“China's working age population has already
peaked

211
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,990
and is expected to fall by 23% by 2050.

212
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,389
Why did it take so long for CCP to ditch its
one-child policy

213
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,260
when the long-term devastating effects it
would have

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,589
on China's economy and ambitions as a world
power

215
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,180
have been obvious for some time now?”

216
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,120
Very good question, Sir Wilfred...

217
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,560
which is definitely your actual name.

218
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,180
Well, on the surface,

219
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,620
the One Child Policy was about making sure

220
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,420
China’s population didn’t grow too fast.

221
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,480
But birth rates were already falling before
it even started.

222
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,440
So why even have the One Child Policy?

223
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,639
Because underneath,

224
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,850
there were even more benefits to implementing

225
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,199
a policy of massive top-down control.

226
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,209
The One Child Policy gave the Party an excuse

227
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,319
to put a whole new level of monitoring into
place.

228
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,110
Employers were literally required

229
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,980
to monitor women’s menstruation cycles.

230
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,240
As you can imagine,

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,660
that level of bureaucracy created lots of
jobs!

232
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,590
Plus, local officials could also make money
off of

233
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,240
fining people who violated the policy.

234
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,330
Like, you didn’t register with the authorities

235
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,970
before getting pregnant.

236
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,029
Doesn’t matter if it’s your first kid.

237
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,140
Pay up or get dragged to the forced abortion
van.

238
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,689
And another benefit was controlling the masses

239
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:32,700
by making them control each other.

240
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,050
For example, if a woman violated the policy,

241
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,980
everyone in her factory or work group would
be punished.

242
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,170
So now you have people watching and reporting
on each other.

243
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,139
And local officials would also be punished

244
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,329
if their area went over their population quotas.

245
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,660
Hence, the forced abortion van.

246
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,350
Now, the examples I gave

247
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,089
didn’t happen everywhere, because,

248
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,519
like a lot of the Party’s top-down control,

249
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,579
it was unevenly enforced.

250
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,790
But I think you get the gist.

251
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,600
The One Child Policy was a massive intrusion

252
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,230
by the state into the fundamental level of
society:

253
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,870
the family.

254
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,230
And even through it \hwasn’t necessary

255
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,120
for controlling population growth,

256
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,279
it was great at controlling the population.

257
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,649
So the One Child Policy makes sense...

258
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,490
in a sort of, evil authoritarian kind of way.

259
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,529
That’s why—

260
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,899
when they ended the One Child Policy in 2015—

261
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,660
they simply replaced it with an equally authoritarian

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,319
Two Child Policy.

263
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,430
Of course it turns out,

264
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,339
the results of their disastrous policies

265
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,480
are now threatening the entire country.

266
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,699
But I’m sure that’s nothing

267
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,709
a *new* type of massive state control can’t
fix.

268
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,709
Thanks for your question.

269
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,949
