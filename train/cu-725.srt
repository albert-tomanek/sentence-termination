1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,020
Do we have proof the coronavirus was engineered?

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,200
The US Air Force prepares for war with China.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,190
And why street names in Hungary are infuriating
China.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:27,679
That and more on this week’s China News
headlines.

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:35,440
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,620
For over a year, anyone who suggested the
coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab, let

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,790
alone was bioengineered in a Chinese lab,
was labeled a right wing conspiracy nut.

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,190
Listen to the science, you morons.

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,129
Well, now the science suggests the coronavirus
is a bioengineered virus that leaked from

10
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,530
a Chinese lab.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,449
Surprise!

12
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,470
Without getting too much into the science,
“The Covid-19 pathogen has a genetic footprint

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,500
that has never been observed in a natural
coronavirus.”

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
It does have a genetic code seen in coronavirus
engineered in labs.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,190
Specifically after gain of function research—that
is, research designed to make viruses more

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,680
deadly and contagious.

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,250
Even more damning, when the Chinese lab “published
a paper in February 2020 with the virus’s

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,610
partial genome, they omitted any mention of
the special sequence that supercharges the

19
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,610
virus.”

20
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,370
Now this special genetic sequence that points
to lab engineering was easy to see.

21
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,300
In fact, scientists in this report from February
2020 noticed it.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,420
The paper says a special protein marker “may
provide a gain-of-function” capability to

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,830
the virus, “for efficient spreading” to
humans.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,560
Again, that was in February 2020.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,590
Before we even began locking down in the United
States.

26
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,519
And yet despite the obvious signs of engineering,
and despite Dr. Anthony Faucisigning off on

27
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,859
US funding for coronavirus research that took
place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

28
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,400
Fauci dismissed the lab leak theory for months.

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,090
Which is why you have fact checks like this
one from last year saying the lab leak was

30
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,440
doubtful.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,209
It now says, “This fact check has been updated.”

32
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,459
Or this one that now says

33
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,550
“scientific consensus has shifted”.

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,879
How about that?

35
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,099
In fact, a report prepared for the US government
by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

36
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,390
found it plausible that Covid leaked from
a Wuhan lab.

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,680
“Lawrence Livermore has considerable expertise
on biological issues.”

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,450
That report was prepared in May 2020, but
it remains classified.

39
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,629
But even knowing about the existence of this
report is further evidence of the lab leak

40
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,629
hypothesis.

41
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,840
It’s amazing what the media can find out
when they actually...report on things.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,659
And here’s a fun fact, “A Chinese Communist
Party military scientist who got funding from

43
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:16,019
the National Institutes of Health filed a
patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in February

44
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,440
last year.”

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,280
So...a Chinese military scientist could have
had a vaccine only a month after the Chinese

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,349
Communist Party admitted there was human-to-human
transmission?

47
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,430
Good to know.

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,010
And after a genetically engineered Chinese
supervirus that was partly funded by the US

49
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:43,139
killed millions...why did top US scientists,
officials, and the media ruthlessly attack

50
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,670
anyone even suggesting it came from a lab?

51
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,910
Somehow, I think we need more of an explanation
than—it was Trump’s fault.

52
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,980
Don’t worry, the WHO says they can’t force
China to give more information on the origin

53
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
of the coronavirus.

54
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,290
I’m so glad Biden stopped us from withdrawing
from the WHO.

55
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,560
Earlier this week I did a deep dive on how
US media discredited the Wuhan lab leak story

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,330
on our other channel, America Uncovered.

57
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,140
Check it out, link is below.

58
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,780
And after the break, the US is preparing for
war with China.

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,080
Welcome back.

60
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
The US is preparing for war with China.

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,920
The Air Force is fanning out jets across the
Pacific.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,380
You see, most US warplanes have been stationed
in either Japan or Guam.

63
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,900
So China built up over a thousand ballistic
missiles capable of wiping out those bases

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,660
in the event of war.

65
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,460
So, the US Air Force is spreading out hundreds
of warplanes across potentially dozens of

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,760
smaller bases—thus diluting the striking
power of China’s rocket force.

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,230
However, the US isn’t prepared for China’s
contingency plan.

68
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,370
To use China’s team rocket force to steal
America’s pokemon.

69
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,640
Gotta catch ‘em all.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,810
Last week was the anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square Massacre.

71
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,060
And Western tech companies had the chance
to prove they’re on the side of Chinese

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
dictators.

73
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,420
According to exiled Hong Kong activist Nathan
Law, the Israel based company Wix shut down

74
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,140
a Hong Kong democracy website.

75
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,820
That was after Hong Kong police asked them
to.

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,330
Don’t worry, Wix said it was a mistake.

77
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,470
Get ready to hear a lot of that.

78
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,720
Microsoft’s Bing search engine came up with
no results found for Tank Man.

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,620
They said it was human error.

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,480
Tiananmen Survivor Zhou Fengsuo , whom we’ve
had on the show before, said a live stream

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,220
commemorating the massacre couldn't be viewed
on YouTube.

82
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,880
“YouTube replied to Zhou citing a possible
technical reason for the video issue.”

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,030
Zhou also said Facebook cut off a live stream
of a Tiananmen commemoration calling it spam.

84
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,670
It was a technical error.

85
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,690
Look, the only technical error was normalizing
trade with China.

86
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,530
Which is apparently something Florida Governor
Ron DeSantis is trying to fight.

87
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,510
Here he is at a press conference this week.

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,280
If you look right now, there is no single
entity that exercises a more pervasive nefarious

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,560
influence across a wide range of American
industries and institutions than the Communist

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,920
Party of China

91
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,330
DeSantis signed two new bills aimed at countering
China.

92
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,200
One of the new laws bans trade secret theft
and trafficking and increases penalties for

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,610
such crimes.

94
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,420
Those that steal for foreign regimes will
face even higher penalties.

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,030
The other bill “aims to cut the Chinese
Communist Party’s access to higher academic

96
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,970
institutions...by prohibiting [them] from
entering into agreements with the Chinese

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,220
regime or companies with close state ties.”

98
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,950
The bills target several different countries,
such as Cuba and Venezuela, but China is the

99
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,480
main focus.

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,180
Unfortunately for Ron DeSantis, he’s a state
governor, not the US president.

101
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,990
He can’t actually set national policy.

102
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,560
But he gets an A for effort.

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,060
Plus an F for Florida.

104
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,890
Unfortunately, the Chinese government knows
how to play that game too—and they can do

105
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,040
it at a national level.

106
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,940
I’ll tell you more after the break.

107
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,460
Welcome back.

108
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,890
China is moving forward with a new law aimed
at countering US sanctions.

109
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:29,050
China doesn’t like the US sanctioning Communist
officials for genociding the Uyghurs, or blocking

110
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,670
China from getting certain sensitive technologies.

111
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,050
That’s why China has been drafting new laws
that “would allow China’s courts to punish

112
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,460
global companies for complying with foreign
sanctions”.

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,210
Oh no, if they punish US companies too much,
they’ll pull out of China.

114
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,640
Then they won’t be cheated, having their
technology stolen and their global market

115
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,530
share taken by cheaper Chinese knockoffs.

116
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,370
They might even have to bring manufacturing
jobs back to America.

117
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,050
Tragedy.

118
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,140
And it turns out, China’s strategy to punish
foreign companies and officials has already

119
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,990
backfired in Europe.

120
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,030
Back in March, China sanctioned EU officials
for sanctioning Chinese officials.

121
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,180
And that killed a major investment deal between
China and the EU.

122
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,150
And speaking of reasons not to do business
with the Chinese Communist Party, did I mention

123
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,230
the genocide in Xinjiang?

124
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,830
Even though China is facing a population crisis
because of hundreds of millions of forced

125
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,610
abortions during the One Child Policy...

126
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,550
that doesn’t mean trying forced abortions
in Xinjiang won’t be a good idea!

127
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,680
New “Chinese birth control policies could
cut between 2.6 to 4.5 million births of the

128
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,560
Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in southern
Xinjiang within 20 years.”

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,540
And a proposed Chinese funded university in
Hungary really backfired for the Chinese regime.

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,490
First, thousands protested against it.

131
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,790
Then the mayor of Budapest decided to do some
inventive street renaming in the capital.

132
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,269
“One street will be named after the Dalai
Lama.”

133
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,490
“Another will be called ‘Uyghur Martyrs’
Road.’”

134
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,100
“A third will be called ‘Free Hong Kong
Road.’”

135
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,749
And “A fourth street will be renamed after
a Chinese Catholic bishop who was jailed.”

136
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,370
Which tells us something very interesting.

137
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,800
The global elite may like the Chinese Communist
Party.

138
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
But your average people, and often your local
politicians, really don’t.

139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,199
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

140
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,220
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

141
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,040
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

142
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,860
oliviero gubelmann asks, “Hi Chris , would
you consider writing a book about all ccp’s

143
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,520
dark secret and history of mad ideas and policy?”

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,199
I’m glad you asked Oliviero!

145
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,339
I was actually talking with Matt and Shelley
about this the other day.

146
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,990
We’ve been making this show for almost 9
years now.

147
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,389
And we’ve learned a lot about the Chinese
Communist Party and its actions against democracies

148
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,819
around the world.

149
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,230
So I had the idea—what if we wrote a book?

150
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,140
It could be a digital book, that would be
pretty simple to do.

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,269
But I guess that all depends on you.

152
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,759
Those of you watching, would you also be interested
in buying a book we write?

153
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,699
Would you want it to have some humor?

154
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,490
Tell me in the comments below what kind of
book you’d like to see.

155
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,290
Thanks for bringing it up Oliviero and thanks
for your support.

156
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,910
And a big thank you to everyone who supports
China Uncensored on Patreon.

157
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,000
