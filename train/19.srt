00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,140
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,940
Joining me today - he reads books you know - it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,380
Home team advantage!

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,600
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan: Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,880
Does this dining chair have an ejector seat and if so, how?

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,220
and the bounciest man on the internet, Matt Gray!

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,860
Hello Youtube!

8
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,000
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,660
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [ding]

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,320
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers which is...

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,460
Today we are talking about Graham Island.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Cause of a national shortage of Grahams in the 1980s when they all emigrated.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,580
Is that what, in this country, we'd call Digestive Biscuit Island?

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,760
Graham crackers!

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,580
Thank you, one for you guys over the water.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
Oh, is that what a Graham cracker is?

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Yeah, it's a digestive.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,880
I didn't know that.

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,360
It's totally a digestive.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,940
Aren't they just called "biscuits anglais" on the continent because they refuse to accept that they have--

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,940
They don't affect your digestion at all

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,720
It's only in Britain where we hold on to this falsehood,

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,580
That's part of the same kind of train of thought that makes them call it "la cor anglais" and not the French horn.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,080
[French accent] Ah, zese crazy English.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Zey sink everything is about them!

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,480
Everysing zat is sh*t is over there

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,240
Your biscuit? Sh*t. Your horn? Sh*t.

28
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,280
Less than two minutes into the show, into the series

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,320
and today's nation we are insulting is France

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,320
Hi, France!

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
We need a spinning wheel with an arrow that goes [rattling noise] ding!

32
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,200
La France!

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,060
Just on everyone except one that says 'Germany'.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,740
We'll get to you

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,500
Eventually.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,280
Amazingly that's what the Germans said to the French in '39!

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,200
F*** Morocco.

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,300
We haven't done that one yet

39
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,900
I'm spreading the love(!)

40
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,100
Tell you what. Eritrea

41
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,400
We got you

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Graham Island

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,600
Okay

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,120
Is it a man or an island?

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,980
It is an actual island

46
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,500
There are a couple of Graham Islands by the way, this is not, uh -

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,400
There is a Graham Island of British Columbia, Canada - so the new world - named after someone.

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,180
This is somewhere in Europe

49
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,600
It's not made of... what islands are normally made of:

50
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,580
You know what 
-- So land?

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,560
So it's no no no, it's not made of land or rocks or bricks or anything.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,720
-- Is it like one of those things that's an oil rig?
-- Hang on, "or bricks?"

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,120
No, islands aren't made of bricks, Gary!

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,460
You were doing so well,

55
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,520
.. until you ... 'I'm gonna give him a point' aahh it's made of bricks... No!

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,100
Is it a volcano waiting to happen?

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
I'll give you a point and I'll give you biscuits for that

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,520
because that was spot on.

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
It is a submerged volcanic island.

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,660
So it isn't?
-- But it's not an island if it's not above the sea, is it

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Which, in 1831, poked above the water for a bit

62
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,560
-- Long enough to be spotted
-- And then became flaccid.

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,240
Yes.

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,560
So this volcano had a momentary dong

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,060
That someone jumped up, stabbed a flag in it and it went beneath the waves.

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,440
I think that's what would happen,
if that was Poseidon's cock

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,180
Which it sounds like it is

68
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,860
You get the flag, and it goes pfft and collapses.

69
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,740
Cold water.

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,660
Well it goes a lot bigger when --

71
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
When El Nino comes past, you know!

72
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,300
It erupts occasionally --

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,620
I'll bet it does...

74
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,700
In 1831, the Royal Navy flagship claimed it for the British Crown

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,480
Where is the island though?

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
The island is off Sicily

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
But it's one of ours?

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,540
It is... well...

79
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
It was all ours in 1841!

80
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
Sorry...

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,480
31.

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
Anyway...

83
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,940
Appeared in July/August 1831, disappeared in...?

84
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,940
-- October, 1831
-- 1850s, after Krakatoa went up.

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,400
Change of sea level, and all that.

86
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,060
It's a wonderful theory, but I was just going for the cheap joke: 1832.

87
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,300
So. new island pops up, British stick a flag in it,

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,880
Automatically a Starbucks on it.

89
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,980
Automatically. Obviously.

90
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,340
Sorry: Ye Starbucks, of the time, obviously

91
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,660
StarbÃ¼cks(!)

92
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,860
How big was this island?

93
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,640
About the size of a Starbucks.

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,220
No, quite a bit bigger, actually

95
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,820
Two Starbucks.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,080
Two Starbucks, a McDonald's and a parking area for doggers.

97
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Point. 63 meters. You can have one for that.

98
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,200
It also had two small lakes.

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,860
Two lakes? That's not a lake! That's just water. that's stuck on top of it when it poked out!

100
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah, do you know any other definition of a lake?

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,180
I would rather... That's just a f***ing puddle!

102
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,100
Again...

103
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,540
Why did Graham island disappear so quickly?

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
It sank?

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
The sea levels rose because of global warming, and ice caps and that kind of stuff.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,980
Not that early...

107
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:43,780
Is it because it was andasitic or continental plate lava rather than oceanic plate lava, which is basaltic and very hard?

108
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,520
Continental plate lava tends to dry as much softer rock so it was eroded much more quickly.

109
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,600
You're absolutely right, it was comprised of very loose volcanic eruption, and simply

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,640
disappeared into the ocean through erosion very quickly. Through wave action.

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,080
-- Sorry; that's amazing work.
-- Sorry guys...

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,260
Take the points. Take all of the points.

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,240
This one is mine

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
Stick a fork in this one: it's done.

115
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,860
And it eroded before anyone could work out who actually owned it.

116
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,740
But we had a flag!

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,060
Sorry Eddie.

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,640
But Her Majesty's flag had been firmly planted atop, and somebody had opened a lovely bistro and restaurant(!)

119
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,080
I like the idea that it is Her Majesty's flag, not the Union flag. Just.

120
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,880
"This is mine... F****** f*** off"

121
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,620
I'm glad you have read the official rules of engagement for claiming new land, which is that

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,720
one of you does dress up as Queen Victoria and say: "F****** f*** off"

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,600
Even if it's not England, still have to dress up as Queen Victoria

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,740
"I am not enjoying zis..."

125
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,800
France!

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,280
There's another one at you!

127
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,640
Lets talk about that conflict then. Who else thought they might have sovereignty over it?

128
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,020
Italy!

129
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,640
But... is Italy existing at this point in time?

130
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,420
There we go...

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,860
Sicilians, potentially.

132
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,140
That's a point. Yes.

133
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,460
The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

134
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
Where's the other one?

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,460
In the very still Mediterranean, they thought there was another Sicily underneath.

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
They spent years tunnelling!

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,320
Two Sicilies were  the island of Sicily and... what else?

138
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
The bottom of Italy

139
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes. Have a point. Absolutely right.

140
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,120
The bottom half of what we'd now call Italy.

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,740
The bit they've managed to invade quite frankly.
Let's face it.

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah.

143
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,220
So did Italy just use to be the top half?

144
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,500
All of Europe was just warring states for--

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Well that's why they're just loose federations. As you know. Switzerland is still a loose federation of states.

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,080
Yes.

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,120
The best one is of course the Helvetic Empire.

148
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,380
It was all kerned beautifully.

149
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,180
Well that's what I thought! I went to Bern for a thing and on top of the big state building...

150
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Is that the name of a place rather than fiery, burny...?

151
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,900
Bern is a place.

152
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,260
It's called Bern because Bern in Swiss means bears

153
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,500
and they've got bears there still

154
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
in a bear enclosure

155
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Amazing tourist attraction.

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
We've caught them all now, they're here

157
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,260
Have you been to Vauxhall? Just asking.

158
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,780
In an enclosure(!)

159
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,580
But, of course, the state building just says, and I didn't know it at the time, just said: Helvetica.

160
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,660
And my first thought-- I looked at it and went,
no it's not.

161
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,420
That's New Roman!

162
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,680
So you got those states.
Other states that'd had a claim on it...?

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,400
If it's in the middle of the Mediterranean

164
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,900
you've probably got any of the Mediterranean states that are around there or close by

165
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,100
England and Sicily... Spain also said--

166
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,940
I like that. Anyone that was close by to the Mediterranean:

167
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,820
England.

168
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,340
We're on the map.

169
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,400
That's mine, that's mine

170
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
Wait: Gibraltar.

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,540
c.f., claim on Gibraltar. We're totally near that(!)

172
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,380
"I think you'll find that means we own this now."

173
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,600
"We own the gate therefore we own--"

174
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,660
"What's that? What's that? You can get in? Try it!"

175
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,860
You now there's still massive fights

176
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,220
with, really fantastically petty, but oh my god still quite s*** scary fights between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar

177
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,340
Basically: not only just move towards a shipping vessel, trained weapons on it.

178
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,500
Like in that kind of "no, we're not joking

179
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,300
"if you don't turn around this one goes off

180
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,280
"and Bob here has got an itchy finger. He's not had a chance to use one of these for real..."

181
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,640
"He's not shot this since 1982 and he's bored."

182
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,400
"And we all want to see the firework display!"

183
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,100
"Turn around chappy."

184
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,940
What I've learnt today is, that I know nothing about the history of Europe.

185
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,920
Do you know anything about the house of Bourbon?

186
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,060
Is that the one that's in Milan? I'm probably wrong.

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
France.

188
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,820
Point. [ding]

189
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,540
Well said.

190
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
How wrong can I be everybody?

191
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,120
European royal house of French origin. What did they want to set up on this lump of volcanic rock?

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
Distillery, if it's bourbon.

193
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,940
Fort!

194
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,660
Hospital!

195
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,580
A palace.

196
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,540
Leper colony.

197
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,520
You're all thinking way...

198
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,560
BUTLINS!

199
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
Point! [ding]

200
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,360
I wouldn't actually say it was a Butlin's. Billy Butlin hadn't really come along and done that concept yet.

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
[French accent] Biilly Butliin.

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,160
But it's a holiday resort.

203
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,100
Is what we've got here.

204
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,680
Obviously Sicily had a different name for the island.

205
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
Barry.

206
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,720
Barry Island.

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
That actually is an island. Aww!

208
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh yeah!

209
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,020
Was it like "Giovanni"?

210
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,740
Yeah, it was Giovanni's.

211
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,460
Too early.

212
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,100
Guiseppi.

213
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,580
They named it after their king, so it was going to be called, Ferdinandea.

214
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,200
Still marked on navigation charts, for many, many years. Kind of stayed about eight meters below sea level.

215
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
For a long, long while.

216
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
What happened in 1987?

217
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,440
It was kerploded on purpose, so it was less of a danger to shipping?

218
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Yeah. I'm going to give you a point for being...

219
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,440
Yeah!

220
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
For being kerploded! [ding]

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Kerploded by accident?

222
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,700
Er, for sh*ts and giggles?

223
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,120
Kerploded by mother nature?

224
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm going to give Gary [ding] the point by saying by accident. What were they actually trying...

225
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,140
I can't believe I'm actually still saying the word kerplode.

226
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,740
What did -- what were they actually trying to kerplode?

227
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,120
This was done, from the air, with a depth charge, in 1987.

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,400
Were they fishing?

229
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
Not with a depth charge!

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,900
They can't be depth charging a bloody submarine. That's an act of war.

231
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,780
Point! [ding]

232
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,820
Not in the Libyan conflict or anything was it?

233
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,400
Libya had submarines?

234
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,880
In 1987 a US Air Force pilot, on a mission to bomb Libya, mistook the island for an enemy submarine.

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
And dropped depth charges on it.

236
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,520
In how many seconds would it have taken him to go, 'They got submarines? No. Pft, We'll leave it then.'

237
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,440
But also... no, no, no. If he was on his way to bomb Libya, and he had depth charges...

238
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,160
They must have had submarines, otherwise why would he have been carrying depth charges?

239
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,340
Otherwise he'd have hit it with a conventional bomb.

240
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,860
That's a fair point. I can't dispute the logic there.

241
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,380
So there is...

242
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,700
Not a very wet country is it?

243
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,200
No.

244
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,880
I've had a look while you guys were talking about that, at the citations and the references on that.

245
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,680
Was it needed?

246
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,180
There is a bit of a dispute about this. It has been removed from the article a couple of times going...

247
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,340
"This is clearly an urban legend."

248
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,060
But there's a reference in the Independent to it. There's a reference in various other news sources.

249
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,700
All of them just saying, "this happened".

250
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,340
And I'm wondering if that's actually true, or whether it's some local legend that's made the newspapers

251
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,500
Everyone's referenced each other.

252
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
That's why it doesn't quite make sense.

254
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,340
Yeah. There's a slim chance he dropped a conventional bomb.

255
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,920
Or a massive chance, I think, as you say...

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,860
Yeah, it didn't actually happen.

257
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,980
The Independent says the Sun reported today... The Sun says the Daily Mirror reported today...

258
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,420
The Daily Mirror went. Yeah alright, er...

259
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,340
What happened today. Somebody blew up a rock. Fantastic.

260
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,200
Fernando said he he's not there any more.

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
And from what we know. The depth of this particular thing it would be eight meters.

262
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,840
Yes

263
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,920
You don't use a depth charge for eight meters.

264
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,340
No! Otherwise I'd pull a gun and start shooting.

265
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,940
You throw bottles at it.

266
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,780
Where've you f------ gone?

267
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,740
If you could depth charge at eight meters, you wouldn't have a boat any more.

268
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,320
You can flip the bird at eight meters.

269
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,060
Top Gun. Just go fly upside down, over the top of it. Flip the bird on the way down.

270
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,920
You can make that reference now!

271
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,740
I saw Top Gun last night for the first time in my life.

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,640
I saw a film today!

273
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,320
God.

274
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,760
What happened in 2000?

275
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,020
Someone put all the bits back together again.

276
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,900
I say it was un-bombed. Erupted again.

277
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh! I'll give you the point for that. It was close to eruption.

278
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,900
There was seismic activity.

279
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,540
(Groans)

280
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,620
# I'm on the cusp...

281
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,060
It wasn't quite there.

282
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,000
So what did Italy do?

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,720
Because it's obviously not Sicily anymore, it's the nation of Italy. What did they do...

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,680
Surrendered!

285
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,460
Italy.

286
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,220
Italy.

287
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Went and parked up next to it, with a flag hung over the side of the boat, ready to go...

288
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,280
Ooh. A little bit further than that.

289
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
What? Actually stood on it as it was...

290
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,960
Yeah, basically. Have a point. [ding]

291
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Actually, yeah, as it's going to be, erm...

292
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
Yeah, it's going to be an extrusion, isn't it?

293
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,200
So the actual bubbly material is at the bottom. It's just pushing up the dried column.

294
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Dried! Cooled column.

295
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,760
Did they cap it so that it was above ground and then claim it?

296
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Chris, out of everyone was closest. They sent a diver down and put a flag, under water, on it.

297
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,120
So then as, when it appeared...

298
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,200
Italy. I respect that. That's pretty cool

299
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,120
As the Scrapheap Challenge of boats comes round the corner of the Mediterranean

300
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Just an Italian, just waving.

301
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,400
[frustrated cry]

302
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,200
Right. Erm,

303
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Ah, by which point.

304
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,880
can we get funding for this? Because that's just such a brilliant denouement.

305
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
As the flag pops out. Just as it gets above.

306
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,120
Just as they are about to start playing that really uppy downy Italian anthem that they've got.

307
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,960
Out comes the Union Jack.

308
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,480
[Cheering]

309
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,800
The Italian one just flutters off.

310
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,080
Sean Connery nods and drives away in his DB5 shaped boat.

311
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,360
No, if Connery did it, just as the Union Jack came out, another one... a Scottish flag.

312
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
St Andrew's Cross.

313
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,600
See, what they should have done is just laser carved it in to the rock.

314
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
Hmmmm.

315
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,120
Argue with that!

316
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,200
But! Erosion was a problem already.

317
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,280
As we have previously established.

318
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,400
He's right you know.

319
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,280
That have done stranger things, because they have all those bases out in the Pacific, haven't they, that are man made islands.

320
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,640
They could just sail in there, put some hoardings round it.

321
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Pump the water out and start slapping concrete on this bastard, until it's actually big enough.

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,280
Compared to reclaimed stuff in Japan...

323
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,200
Do a Dubai on it.

324
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
Yeah!

325
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,880
Do it in the shape of my face.

326
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,680
Have like a nose shaped volcano in the middle of it.

327
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,120
Well there's that one in Dubai, isn't there, where there's the guy's cut his name in canals.

328
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,760
Hasn't he? That you can see from space.

329
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,840
And then reverted it.

330
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,680
They're not there any more.

331
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,320
They're cut in, and then somehow they got... not paved over, but reclaimed.

332
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Because there's not much water out there, let's face it

333
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,360
If the island does rise again, it's almost certainly going to be within...

334
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,000
"THE ISLAND WILL RISE AGAIN!"

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,720
Thank you.

336
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,880
If the island... appears above the waves again, because of modern treaties...

337
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,720
Who will have rights to it now?

338
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,060
Is it in international waters?

339
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,100
No. Not any more.

340
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,460
-- It's in territorial waters?
-- Yes.

341
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,740
-- Is it Italian territorial waters?
-- There we go.

342
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,600
-- It's Italy's.
-- Point. [ding]. Simple as that.

343
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,220
"It's just a little island. We're not going to have a big fight over it."

344
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,060
Those are words that will get spashed over a paper in about five years time.

345
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,820
So they said 'It's yours'?

346
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,880
I mean you could choose to interpret it as that.

347
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Ooh, so it's, who gets there first?

348
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
To the scrapheap!

349
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,520
At the end of the show, congratulations Chris.

350
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,940
You win this week. I think fairly clearly

351
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,080
Well I think Brannan put up a fight in the end.

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,880
It was close, it was close.

353
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,740
(It's mine.)

354
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,800
Congratulations, you win a patch of Somerset marshland,

355
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
that's been filled with oily fish,

356
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,900
that was previously owned by a documentary film maker and a white rapper.

357
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,620
Oh God.

358
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,300
Jesus.

359
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,600
Go on. Come on.

360
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,060
It's Michael Moore and Macklemore's mackerel moor.

361
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,600
You enjoy your time on that.

362
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,780
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel.

363
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,560
Woohoo!

364
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,520
Gary Brannan.

365
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,480
Matt Gray.

366
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,980
Bye!

367
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,840
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time.

368
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,800
