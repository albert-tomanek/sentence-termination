1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,540
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,640
Joining me today, he reads books you know, it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,940
[mumbles] I've got something in my teeth.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,440
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,640
Insert power cable here.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,260
Where?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,680
Oh, you know.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,460
You committed to that.  I didn't think you 'd go for that one.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,480
I didn't think you'd go right in it.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,200
Urgh!

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,340
And the bounciest man on the Internet, Matt Gray.

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,700
Bienvenue, YouTube!

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,260
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,460
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [ding].

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,180
And there's a special prize for a particularly good answers, which is...

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,660
And today we are talking about Project Cybersyn.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,800
Oh! Oh...! Oh... There are many cyber sins.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,880
Is it a campaign by the Church of England to absolve robots of their sins?

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,660
No, and it is spelt S Y N.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,400
Oh come on! This is a novel or something.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,840
Nope. This is entirely real. But I'll admit it sounds a little bit science fictiony.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
So is it sin or synthetic?

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,300
It's an abbreviation of something. I'll give you one point for that [ding].

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,080
Ah, synergy...

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,040
Point! [ding]

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,540
Wahey, uh-huh!

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,220
It is indeed a portmanteau of cybernetics and synergy.

28
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,100
Is it a government policy somewhere?

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,020
Ooh! Yes, have a point [ding].

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,260
Does anyone want to guess where in the world...

31
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,800
AMERICA!

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
Which bit?

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,580
[bad Southern US accent] The South.

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,020
Now... if I said the...

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,960
Whatever the answer was correct, is the one I meant.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
Yes Gary, have a point. It's in South America. [ding]

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,900
Yea!

38
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,640
Chile.

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,880
No, I'm fine, I've got a jumper on.

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,560
I deliberately didn't pronounce it 'chilly', just so you wouldn't do that joke.

41
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,720
Sod it!

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,120
It's happening anyway. Deal with it.

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,680
I say, to be fair, all that did was to make you sound really pretentious.

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
Yes.

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,800
[Posh accent] Chile.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,040
[Posh accent] Chile, I think you will find it's pronounced.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
I think you'll find it's pronounced "CHYLE".

48
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,180
That's what Jimi Hendrix says.

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,820
That's what we does.

50
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,680
It's not Voodoo Chilli. Or maybe it should be that.

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,860
[Posh accent] It's Voodoo Chilé.

52
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,500
[Posh accent] Voodoo Chilé?

53
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,520
[Posh accent] Voodoo Chilé.

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,900
You know it's one of those sleeveless jackets.

55
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,620
But you become a zombie when you put it on.

56
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,920
A voodoo gilet!

57
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm so puffy and warm and... BRAINS!

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,580
Chile is the far left of bottom America, right?

59
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,940
It is. For most of the way down.

60
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,860
Bottom America!

61
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,900
Far left of bottom America. You navigate like I do.

62
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,280
It's the long one, isn't it?

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,780
Yes.

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,840
It's the long thin one that goes all the way down one side.

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,600
We went to school you know.

66
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,060
About when are we talking about? When would you expect to see...

67
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,680
Lunch time!

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
2:30!

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
Two men swinging at the same ball there, eh?

70
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,080
It's like one of those out takes from a baseball game, where you see two people running for the same ball.

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,740
What decade...

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
would you expect to hear Project Cybersyn?

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
-- If this isn't '80s, I am disappointed.
-- 70s?

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,360
You're going to be disappointed, it's the '70s. Have a point, Matt [ding]

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Are we making South American robots?

76
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,540
1971 to 1973.

77
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,320
Is that when they took over and killed everyone?

78
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,100
No...

79
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,740
South America in that era. That's a dubious joke to be making.

80
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,640
That's what ended Project Cybersyn, was a military coup

81
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,520
that destroyed the control room.

82
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,300
So yes... but(!)

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It was a military [pigeon noise]

84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Military coo...

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,960
Pigeons are coming! Release the robots!

86
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,560
Sir, the robots aren't finished. The pigeons are pecking them to pieces! Oh, what a world!

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Sir. The robots...

88
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
...ARE pigeons.

89
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
[Pigeon coos]
-- Oh my god!

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,340
I can't take my glasses off, I'm wearing contacts.

91
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,300
[Pigeon coos] [Robotic buzz]

92
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,980
My God!

93
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,940
[Robotic buzz] [Pigeon coos]

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,560
[Quietly] I don't like this.

95
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,980
What I'd like in a robot pigeon is two things.

96
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,440
One, someone would have to spend ages perfecting that pigeon walk...

97
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,840
so that their heads go back and forwards at the same speed they walk still.

98
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,980
That's easy. You just put another linkage across their of their neck and have it link to the back of their forehead.

99
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,500
That's a modern gyro that's got to try and not compensate for that.

100
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,340
And the other is, they'll still make it so they pick up cigarette butts.

101
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,000
Every pigeon in the square, moving in unison.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,640
Aargh!

103
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,320
That would be creepy.

104
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh, we've gone too far now.

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Laser eyes.

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,760
Yeah, natch. Obviously. They can't hold one, they've got wings dammit!

107
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,520
It's not going to flap its wings to fly. It's going to have a rocket up its bum.

108
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,620
For those of you just tuning in, Project Cybersyn...
is not robot pigeons.

109
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,400
I can just see a whole Trafalgar Square of pigeons...

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,000
just stopping, wings extending and just them all launching upwards...

111
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,220
in synergy.

112
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,020
Now that's a beaut... compared to them all turning round to look at you in synergy, that's a beautiful image.

113
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,400
Project Cybersyn... gentlemen.

114
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Robot pigeons, wasn't it?

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,500
Robot, rocket-arsed pigeons.
We've confirmed this already, Tom.

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,820
Chile.

117
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,740
1970s... early 1970s as well.

118
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,620
Was it a public computing project?

119
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,420
Ooh!

120
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,000
You can have a point [ding].
But what do you mean by public?

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
A terminal in a cafe for someone -- for everyone to use.

122
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,340
No. Not quite.

123
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,080
One of these state sponsored, productivity drives, that is going to put robots in factories.

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,820
To make things more efficient.

125
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,220
Yeah, you keep doing this... 'Is it a state sponsored productivity... robots... in that...'

126
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
No.... no.

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,180
State sponsored. You know I will give you a point. State sponsored productivity [ding]. Because, you know, socialist government then.

128
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,020
What were they trying to do?

129
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,100
Get everyone computing?

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,860
Teach computer literacy?

131
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,340
Yeah, but that's too early. That's '70s.

132
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,180
Way too early.

133
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,340
The thing then was all about improving productivity in workplaces...

134
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,220
because that's where places ended up with, like, robotic shop floors and stuff.

135
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,780
So is it to do with shipping and transport and integrated movement of goods and stuff like that?

136
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,240
Yes! Have a point [ding]

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,380
Databases isn't it?

138
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,320
And you have a point as well [ding].

139
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,600
It was an attempt to plan the economy of Chile....

140
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,220
Using one massive computer system.

141
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,680
Now! As this had a very short period of time working.

142
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,560
Do I assume it wasn't entirely successful?

143
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,200
And everyone ended up burning down?

144
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,160
No, it did actually have a bit of success.

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,940
Did it declare humans as 'no longer essential'?

146
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,260
No, they managed to switch it on. To look at the errors in the code.

147
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,200
The screen flashes 'you're better off with a coup'.

148
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,740
I know nothing about the politicals here. I don't know if that's even appropriate.

149
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,260
"We've turned it on and all the screen says is 'Death!'"

150
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,060
All the state-run factories were given a computer terminal

151
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,060
where they typed all their details of what was happening.

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
And that got fed back to...?

153
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,940
The president's office.

154
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,980
The mainframe.

155
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,560
A fellow in very small glasses with a slide rule.

156
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,780
Matt's closer [ding].

157
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,420
America!

158
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,920
No. It was a central control room in Chile.

159
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
Complete with, what?

160
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,180
Coffee machine?

161
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,000
Toilets?

162
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
There was a lot of manu...

163
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,200
If this was the '70s, a strike!

164
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll tell you what, have a point [ding].

165
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,960
It helped deal with striking truck workers.

166
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,080
By killing them?

167
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
No. By...

168
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,900
No.

169
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,700
"Computer, what is our solution?"

170
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,620
"It just says 'Death!' again."

171
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,260
"Whatever I press!"

172
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,900
Striking truck drivers blocked all the access streets going to the capital.

173
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
But they were able to work out what routes were free.

174
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,740
What factories still had some workers that could send things out. And they used this central computer for it.

175
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,260
Oh, it had Google Maps?

176
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,420
Not really back then?

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,440
No! Bing!

178
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh God!

179
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,880
"Ah! I see you want to visit...
the centre of the Atlantic Ocean."

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
"Here is a picture of France."

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Thanks Bing!

182
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Thanks Bing!

183
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,600
Bing would be so much better if it was voiced by Bing Crosby.

184
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,840
"So, I see you wanna find out more 'bout York in England do you...?"

185
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
"Well son, here you go."

186
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,780
Except it's Bing, So you'd just be given a map of the New York tube system.

187
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,600
"Son, why d'ya wanna go anywhere else?"

188
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,880
"Ah sir, that's all ya need to know about York... uh... you're not there."

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
"Swell game, fellas."

190
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,320
What did the central planning office have for the seven people, that were sat around...

191
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,940
Seats?

192
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,020
Super cool, lean back consoles with many screens and...

193
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm going to give you the point [ding]. They had...

194
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,860
This is the '70s, whirling tape and lights, surely?

195
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,700
Oh yeah!

196
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,500
There we go. 1970s, Star Trek, science fiction style, command console chairs

197
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,200
for the seven people who took all this information and made the decisions.

198
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,520
A sign on the toilet, saying 'Captain's Log'.

199
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,440
Aww...

200
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,300
Which was fine, apart from the chaps in the very short dresses.

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,180
Oh yeah!

202
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,720
-- I'm thinking Star Trek uniforms here.
-- Yeah.

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,200
Early Next Generation Star Trek had gender neutral uniforms

204
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,280
that were basically short dresses, down to about...

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,500
I believe they were called skants.

206
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,560
Skants. Yes.

207
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,080
I thought that sounds like a crisp based snack.

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,900
Skant!

209
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,520
-- Skants!
-- New Skants!

210
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,160
You open the bag -- there's not much in.

211
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,220
Buy them today...

212
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,460
BECAUSE THE COMPUTER TOLD YOU!

213
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Buy them or face the Pigeons!

214
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,280
You know in history, there are these people who have these grand dreams of socialist planning and computers

215
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,740
that are never made real.

216
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
This man's dream became real.

217
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,720
William Shatner!

218
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,760
He just wanted a real life Enterprise.

219
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,500
What country did Stafford Beer come from?

220
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,560
'Murica!

221
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,540
No.

222
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,880
The United Kingdom!

223
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
Yes he did! [ding].

224
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,160
A British management cybernetics consultant.

225
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,440
-- [BEEP]ing hell.
-- What? In 70s...

226
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,480
-- In 1970s.
-- You can't be that any more, can you?

227
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
Stafford Beer.

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,980
You have to be a startup to be one of those now.

229
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,860
He also sympathised with the Chilean socialists.

230
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,120
And that worked quite well!

231
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
I imagine it did.

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,760
He basically got, I don't know if it was a phone call in those days, but he got a message, out of the blue.

233
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
-- Probably a telex.
-- A telex, surely?

234
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,580
From the COM-PU-TER!

235
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,760
From the wonderfully named Fernando Flores and he basically dropped all his other work and said

236
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,960
"Yes, I will go to Chile!"

237
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
Someone picked it up later. It would be all over the floor.

238
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,120
And help the socialists.

239
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,280
Did they have a five year plan?

240
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,540
Well they did. But it lasted about two years.

241
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,400
I was going to say, did that not work out?

242
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,040
That's the duration of most five year plans, in my experience. Actually, yeah.

243
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
Let me guess, they ****ed off, quite soon after.

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,040
No, they were given a military coup.

245
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,580
Given one?! ♫ Happy Birthday to you...

246
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,080
♫ Here's a military coup... ♫

247
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,560
♫ You've five minutes to leave

248
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,280
♫ And your family too! ♫

249
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,880
I mean Chris, you pressed the button there, but it was entirely justified.

250
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,760
Those are biscuits for Gary. Well done.

251
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,220
Yes. The 1973 Chilean coup d'etat.

252
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,420
Aren't those the little things you have at parties?

253
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,540
-- That's... that's...
-- Crudités!

254
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,880
A crudités coup d'etat!

255
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Ooh look! It's shaped like a tiny rifle.

256
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
How avant-garde!

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,320
Ooh! It's taken over my intestines!

258
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Yes, the caviar was somewhat suspect.

259
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Opens the fridge... Flags... Parade...

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,520
Tins of pilchards going round like nuclear missiles.

261
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,260
Than, many years later, people are wearing red t-shirts, with crudités on them.

262
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,060
Big pictures of a tin of sardines...

263
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,740
Being held. They were obviously airbrushed, to make them look a bit newer.

264
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,540
Yeah!

265
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
The smoked salmon ones are at the top

266
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,820
because although all men are born equal, some are more equal than others.

267
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Apart from one really old one in the middle. Looks like it could fall off at any time.

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
With an awesome mustache.

269
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,660
It's a Chilean coup, so with a big hat, sunglasses.

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
Who backed the Chilean coup? In 1973?

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,540
The COM-PU-TER did!

272
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,780
It's got to be the States.

273
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,320
It's go to be the States. Richard Nixon's government. Yes [ding].

274
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,960
There is a name you might recognise, that came to power afterwards.

275
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
-- Pinochet!
-- Pinochet! [ding]

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,340
Dammit! I would have been right. Ah well.

277
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,880
It was the coup in which Pinochet came to power.

278
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,320
And... you know...

279
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,200
As part of this, the massive infrastructure of socialism that Nixon and the U.S. were fighting against.

280
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,120
This massive computer orchestrated thing... destroyed.

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,980
It's worth pointing out, in less than...

282
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,120
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

283
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,720
I didn't actually intend for that to connect.

284
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,360
-- Hel-lo!
-- Handbags at dawn ladies!

285
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,920
He's right, it was worth pointing out.

286
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,680
That is the most 'shut that door' slap I've ever seen, Tom.

287
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,060
It really is.

288
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,840
It's worth mentioning that they actually did get to advanced prototype in under two years.

289
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,020
Which for a central government operation -- like, I don't know if Britain could do that

290
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,560
with one thing right now.
Let alone a big national project.

291
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,480
So they went full-on startup?

292
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,580
Yeah. They...

293
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,520
They had a great idea. They burned out after two years, almost literally.

294
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,120
That's it. That's all I'm saying.

295
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,460
Yeah, they managed it.

296
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,480
And no-one really got any money at the end. And the person whose idea it was,

297
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,340
despite the fact it was technically a failure, went back and had a successful career doing other things.

298
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,360
And no-one's heard about it now!

299
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Basically a tech startup. There you go.

300
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,480
The late '90s, documented, right there.

301
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,180
Yes!

302
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,300
So, congratulations at the end of that. I think Gary, you...

303
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,080
You very clearly win this one.

304
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,080
You win a restaurant that cooks lingerie over a box of hot coals, that was previously owned by a famous civil engineer...

305
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,000
Go on...

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
It's Brunel's Brassieres and Braziers Brasserie.

307
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,260
So congratulations, enjoy that.

308
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,980
With that we say good bye to Chris Joel...

309
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,260
To Gary Brannan...

310
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,040
To Matt Gray...

311
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,520
I've been Tom Scott and we'll see you next time.

312
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
