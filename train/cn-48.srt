1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,080
There's a 'See also' here for 'Digby Tatham-Warter'.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,029
Is that a surname or a place?

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:08,210
That is a name.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,740
He was known for bringing
something into battle as well.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,900
Oh God...!

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,940
His family.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,630
Little Timmy with the scarf around the neck!

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,839
A melon baller.

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,769
Refused to kill anyone unless he gouged their
eyes out.

10
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,039
Was he the complete opposite, did he bring
something really soft?

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,320
It is exactly the sort of thing that if you
are an Englishman going into battle,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,780
stereotypically you would hit someone with
or poke someone with.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,380
An umbrella?

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,770
An umbrella, yes.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,770
Just imagine!

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,750
One guy with a claymore, the other just twirling
the umbrella.

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,750
He had trouble remembering passwords.

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,550
What did he think that carrying an umbrella
into battle would do instead?

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,500
Identify him, so people knew who he was without
the damn passwords?

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,060
Identify him as what?

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,870
A man who doesn't like getting his head wet?

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,870
"Damnably English!"

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,870
Yes, absolutely right.

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,090
I quote, 'Only a bloody fool of an Englishman

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,180
"would carry an umbrella into battle.'

26
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
"Hello.

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,430
"I'm a bloody fool of an Englishman!

28
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,890
"Nice weather."

29
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,330
Self-defining as 'a bloody fool of an Englishman?'

30
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,720
- Yes.
- Wow.

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
What did he actually manage to do with that
umbrella?

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,160
- Stab himself.
- Did he poke someone with it?

33
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,700
A little bit more than that.

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
Capture 42 men.

35
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,140
Because he'd walk up behind someone,

36
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,049
poke the point of the umbrella in the small
of their back

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,280
and say he's got a whole regiment behind him
or something like that.

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
It's exactly the kind of stunt a guy like
that would try and pull.

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,259
No, he disabled a German armoured car 
by incapacitating the driver

40
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,440
by poking the umbrella through a slit.

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,300
"An umbrella!"

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,220
Whatever the German word for umbrella is,
I'm very sorry,

43
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,220
"An umbrella, was?"
