1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,160
Fighting evil by moonlight

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,720
Winning love by daylight

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,120
Never running from a real fight

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,840
Xi is the one named Sailor Moon!

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,880
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,320
China celebrated its third ever Space Day
on April 24.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,760
And what better way to celebrate than with
this video

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,939
from The China National Space Administration.

10
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,510
It shows the history of the Chinese Communist
Party’s space program.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,690
But more importantly,

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,750
it reveals the Party’s of plans for a moon
base!

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,040
...and potentially some kind of Earth destroying
laser.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,030
OK, I’m not sure about that last one.

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,390
Anyway, there’s an ancient legend

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,160
about a Chinese princess named Chang’e

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,150
who lives on the moon in a lunar palace.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,890
Until the evil Queen Beryl used the power
of the Negaforce

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,360
to destroy the Silver Millennium and kill
the moon princess,

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,210
who reincarnated on Earth...

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,420
What’s that, Shelley?

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,420


23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,460
Yes, I know that’s the wrong moon princess.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,540
But Sailor Moon is way more fun.

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,900
The point is, the Chinese Communist Party
is rebuilding

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,299
China’s ancient moon kingdom.

27
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,740
“China’s dream of residing in a lunar
palace

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,970
will soon become a reality.”

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,950
Although their “palace” might not be so
glamorous.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,890
Back in July, they locked 4 students in a
capsule

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,250
similar to the one they plan to build on the
Moon.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,120
“Cultivating plants using seeds and fertilizer

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,180
made from their own poop.”

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,100
That is less fun than astronaut ice cream.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,140
Don’t worry.

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,140
The Chinese Communist Party

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,281
is not launching students to the moon

38
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,640
to survive off their own poop.

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,760
Matt Damon already did that on Mars.

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,640
No, the Communist Party’s plan is to send

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,900
containers of flower seeds and silkworm larva

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,100
in containers like this on a December trip

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,700
to the dark side of the moon.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,410
But surely there’s no dark side

45
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,750
to China’s moon ambitions.

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,850
Except...well...

47
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,850
You know how the United States space program,

48
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,850
NASA,

49
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,250
is a civilian organization?

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,549
Well, China’s space program is a branch

51
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:20,360
of the Communist Party’s People’s Liberation
Army.

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,580
So China’s moonbase will actually be set
up

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,810
by the Chinese military.

54
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,049
That’s because to the Chinese Communist
Party,

55
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,469
space is the final frontier...

56
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,469
of war.

57
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,069
I’m not making this up.

58
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,639
That’s according to this report to the US
government.

59
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,370
Chinese military analysts view space

60
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,499
as the “ultimate high ground,”

61
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,129
and claim that “space warfare is inevitable.”

62
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,540
And for the Chinese military,

63
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,709
“seizing the initiative is to achieve space
supremacy.”

64
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,889
The report warns that the Chinese regime

65
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,700
is developing capabilities that “could also
be used

66
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,629
to attack U.S. bases and the bases of its
allies in Asia

67
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,469
as well as targets within the 50 states.”

68
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:05,599
Yeah, turns out, that’s no moon.

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,379
That’s a battle station.

70
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,139
The moon is a key part of China’s long-term

71
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,689
space warfare strategy.

72
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,230
Richard Fisher, senior fellow

73
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,969
with the International Assessment and Strategy
Center,

74
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:21,659
says “China wants to control the Earth–Moon
system.

75
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,109
By doing so, it can impose a toll on

76
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,939
the space economy ambitions of the West.”

77
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,849
A key part of that is helium-3.

78
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,079
And no, that’s not what Xi Jinping will
inhale

79
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,739
to sound like Sailor Moon.

80
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,230
Helium-3 is a key fuel for nuclear fusion
energy,

81
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,060
an almost unlimited source of non-polluting
energy.

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,159
And while there’s basically none of it on
Earth,

83
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,620
“Some estimates suggest there are at least

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,790
1.1 million metric tons of helium-3

85
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,609
on the lunar surface,

86
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,549
enough to power human energy needs

87
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,790
for up to 10,000 years.”

88
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,909
And there’s yet another reason

89
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,180
why the Chinese Communist Party

90
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,109
wants to set up shop on the moon.

91
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,389
According the legend,

92
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,480
the moon has already been Chinese territory

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,230
since ancient times.

94
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,370
Because Moon Princess.

95
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,229
But now, the Communist Party is looking put
that claim

96
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,260
on more solid footing.

97
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,690
According to a 1967 UN Treaty signed by over
100 countries,

98
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,190
including China,

99
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,930
no one is allowed to own the moon.

100
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,280
But the Chinese Communist Party

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,310
still wants a slice of the moon pie—

102
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,950
the same way they’ve been carving out

103
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,420
slices of the South China Sea,

104
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,930
and setting up military bases there,

105
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,020
even though the rest of the world

106
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,640
has been telling them they’re not allowed
to.

107
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,320
And for the Party,

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,440
“Sending a spacecraft to the Moon...

109
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,400
may provide a compelling case for recognition

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,180
if the Moon were ever to be carved up

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,690
into zones of research and economic development.”

112
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,280
So flowers and silkworms on the moon count

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,300
as territorial claims, right?

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,620
Of course, China isn’t the only country
going to the Moon.

115
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,820
And who is this mysterious rival?

116
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,190
Why, it’s US President Donald Trump!

117
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,220
And he wants to join Xi on the moon.

118
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,700
In the 2019 budget for NASA,

119
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,640
the president’s Space Policy Directive is
that

120
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,660
“the United States will lead the return

121
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,960
of humans to the Moon.”

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,740
It puts moon funding above even another space
station.

123
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,330
And Trump is the first president to ever

124
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,600
seriously talk about putting US troops in
space.

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,720
“My new national strategy for space recognizes

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,380
that space is a warfighting domain,

127
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,750
just like the land, air, and sea.

128
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,180
We may even have a Space Force.”

129
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,660
Make Space Great again.

130
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,110
Not that it ever wasn’t.

131
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,140
I assume Trump is also going to build a space
wall

132
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,000
to keep out those illegal aliens.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,080
So the US is competing with a Communist superpower

134
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,650
to build rival moon bases.

135
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,810
The sixties are back, baby.

136
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,740
Hopefully they don’t bring back the constant
fear

137
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,330
of impending nuclear annihilation.

138
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,420
But in terms of this new space race,

139
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,170
the US is already winning...

140
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,430
at least when it comes to spending.

141
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,130
The US spends about 21 billion dollars a year
on NASA,

142
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,230
while China only spends 3 billion on its space
program.

143
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,540
Though the Chinese Communist Party

144
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,850
has gotten some hits in.

145
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,460
They were responsible for hacking

146
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,320
“NASA climate satellites in 2007 and 2008

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,140
but no permanent damage was reported”.

148
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,760
The thing is, space is already a part of modern
warfare.

149
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,230
GPS for soldiers and missiles, communications,

150
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,300
wireless Internet, even a lot of spying—

151
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,600
that all relies on satellites in space.

152
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,870
Destroy those satellites and you can cripple

153
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,510
a much larger army.

154
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,610
That’s something the Chinese regime understands.

155
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,240
It’s been decades since the the last space
race,

156
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,870
so a lot of this moonbase stuff

157
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,360
sounds more like science fiction.

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,310
But it might not be as far away as we think.

159
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,540
And this new space race

160
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,780
could make for some strange bedfellows.

161
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,570
So what do you think of China’s moon plans?

162
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,610
And will Tuxedo Trump and Sailor Xi

163
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,010
ever get over their differences?

164
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,350
Leave your fan fiction below.
