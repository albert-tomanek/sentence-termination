00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,060
a polarizing issue.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,799
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,160
Now you just know a giant shopping mall in
a communist-ish country

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,540
has got to be something special.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,290
And the Grandview Mall in Guangzhou is no
exception.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,520
It has everything!

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,160
A movie theater,

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,480
indoor ice skating,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,730
and as the Guangzhou travel guide puts it,

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,640
“all these lovely background music.”

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,910
But that’s not all.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,570
There’s also the Grandview Mall Ocean World,

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,730
an aquatic wonderland!

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,500
Or as one person on Trip Advisor calls it,

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,660
“a mall with the most disgusting zoo in
the world.”

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,870
And the star attraction is...

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,720
the saddest polar bear in all of China.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,399
Now you might be thinking,

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,989
what in the name of all that is holy is wrong
with that bear?

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,070
Well, it’s because he lives in a shopping
mall.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,430
There’s not even any snow in his cage.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,050
And he has to deal with people banging on
the glass to take photos of him.

24
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,700
Someone should give him a Coca Cola.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,120
That footage comes from Animals Asia,

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,830
a Hong Kong based animal rights charity.

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,140
They’re trying to get the exhibition shut
down.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,750
And so far,

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,010
they’ve gotten around 300,000 people to
sign a petition for just that.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,880
Because it’s not just a sad polar bear.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,590
There’s also six young beluga whales,

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,810
five walrus calves,

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,390
a wolf,

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,850
and arctic foxes.

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,280
And all of them are equally sad,

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,299
living in equally terrible conditions.

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,210
I’m mean seriously,

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,960
this little guy otter be kept in cleaner conditions.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,540
Of course my favorite state run Party mouthpiece,
the Global Times,

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,259
wrote an article specifically to counter all
these accusations of cruelty.

41
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,350
As you might guess,

42
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,560
they interviewed the aquarium manager,

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,720
who also denies all the claims.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,340
Local media, however,

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,439
reported that the Guangzhou Ocean and Fishery
Bureau

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,179
investigated and discovered that some animals

47
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,780
died while being moved into the aquarium.

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,420
This is by no means an isolated incident.

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,560
Quote unquote “Zoos” in China don’t
always put animal welfare as a top priority.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,200
Monkeys and a bear racing on bicycles?!

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,980
What could go wrong?!

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,230
Wait for it…

53
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,340
I mean who could have seen that coming?

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,500
And besides general animal cruelty,

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,230
there’s specific animal cruelty you can
get in on!

56
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,530
Like feeding a live sheep to a tiger.

57
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,410
So is this a systemic thing?

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,260
Well, probably not.

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,450
According to Peter Li, Humane Society International’s
China expert,

60
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,209
“There’s nothing cultural or traditional
about animal abuse in China.”

61
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,160
The problem is that animal welfare laws in
China

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,050
are few and far between.

63
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,310
And where they do exist,

64
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,709
enforcement is pretty lax.

65
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,970
So this kind of stuff that PETA shows here
can happen.

66
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,110
Fortunately, as Animals Asia puts it,

67
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,940
“what is clear is that a significant section
of Chinese society

68
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,379
will not accept this.”

69
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,290
So what do you think about the saddest polar
bear in China?

70
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,150
Leave your comments below.

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,410
And if you’d like to actually do something
about it,

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,379
I’ve put a link to Animal Asia’s petition
in the description below.

73
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,159
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,800
I’m your host Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
