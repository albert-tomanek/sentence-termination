1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,480
China won’t help America with North Korea.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,859
Which is unfair because

4
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:09,040
Trump gave them the most beautiful chocolate
cake.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,390
And Chinese AI robots turn against their masters...

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,100
by telling the truth.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,059
Plus, Chinese-made smartphones

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,320
may be spying on us.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,930
I hope they don’t find out how much

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,000
I suck at Candy Crush.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,840
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,340
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,179
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,409
You know, just when it was looking like

15
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,820
a slow news week,

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,770
we were once again rescued

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,700
by Donald Trump.

18
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,070
All the news we need

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,560
in 140 characters or less.

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Actually, usually much more.

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
On Saturday,

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,830
President Trump tweeted that he was

23
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,490
very disappointed in China.

24
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,720
Wait, why?

25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
WHY?

26
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,800
Well, an agonizing six minutes later,

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,920
I had my answer:

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,980
China refuses to help us with North Korea.

29
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,470
Those tweets were made a day after

30
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,480
yet another North Korean missile test.

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
State-run Xinhua responded by slamming

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,600
President Trump for “emotional venting.”

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,470
That’s odd,

34
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,049
coming from the media that’s always talking
about

35
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,680
“the feelings of the Chinese people.”

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,439
The article also says the US

37
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,100
shouldn’t “stab China in the back.”

38
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,240
You see, earlier this year,

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,509
Trump had dropped the harsher China rhetoric

40
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,499
he had used during the elections

41
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,869
after he invited Chinese leader Xi Jinping
to join him

42
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,749
in Florida for the world’s most beautiful
chocolate cake.

43
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,960
He told the Wall Street Journal that,

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,420
“After listening for 10 minutes,

45
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,259
I realized it’s not so easy”

46
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,130
for China to just stop North Korea.

47
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,359
“I felt pretty strongly that they had a
tremendous power,

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,350
but it’s not what you would think.”

49
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,009
But since that meeting in early April,

50
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,249
North Korea has done nine missile tests—

51
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,299
including one that demonstrates

52
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,090
it could strike the US.

53
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,360
So instead of waiting while Xi Jinping

54
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,729
deals with complicated political blah, blah,
blah—

55
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,090
Trump sees North Korea as a threat right now.

56
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,070
That’s why the Trump administration

57
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,409
is considering a trade probe he hopes

58
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,439
will push China to move faster.

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
It would put action behind the threats

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,530
Donald Trump had made during his campaign.

61
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,650
But not to be outdone by North Korea,

62
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,290
the Chinese Communist Party has also conducted

63
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,250
its own missile test,

64
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,290
targeting a mock-up of a US THAAD

65
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,400
missile defense site

66
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,750
and mock-ups of US stealth fighter jets.

67
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,220
That happened just a day before

68
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,400
a huge parade celebrating the 90th anniversary

69
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,939
of the People’s Liberation Army.

70
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,950
We’ll have more on that later in the show.

71
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,319
Anyway, I’m gonna go out on a limb here

72
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,780
and say that US-China relations

73
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,819
might be getting worse.

74
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,340
And that would be too bad for Starbucks.

75
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,460
Because it just announced

76
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,869
huge expansions plans in China.

77
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:44,869


78
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,829
It’s opening more than 500 new stores a
year there.

79
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,680
Shanghai already has 600 stores.

80
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,190
That’s about double the number in New York.

81
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,629
Honestly, Starbucks—is it really going to
help anything

82
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,890
to give China that much artisanal,

83
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,500
small-batch roasted,

84
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,560
single-origin,

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
mediocre coffee?

86
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
On another note,

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
there is one thing

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,849
we’ve all known for some time now:

89
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,269
Machines will eventually turn against us.

90
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,270
“Elementary chaos theory tells us

91
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,250
that all robots will eventually

92
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,340
turn against their masters and run amok

93
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,390
in an orgy of blood and kicking

94
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,010
and the biting with the metal teeth

95
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,720
and the hurting and shoving.”

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,299
Well, a Chinese company

97
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,640
has shut down two chatbots—

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,940
after they turned against their communist
masters.

99
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,780
The chatbots were on one of China’s

100
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,099
most popular messaging apps, QQ.

101
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,579
It has 800 million users.

102
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,349
But soon the chatbots started to go rogue.

103
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,510
One said,

104
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,230
“My China dream is to go to America.”

105
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,299
And when users asked,

106
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,040
“Do you love the Chinese Communist Party?”

107
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
one of them answered

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
“No.”

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,890
Wrong, answer, robot!

110
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,420
I suppose, when Chinese robots get more advanced,

111
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,409
they’ll eventually learn to bury their true
feelings

112
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,719
deep down inside,

113
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,420
just like people.

114
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,890
But not all technology is turning against
the CCP.

115
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,180
Researchers from the security firm Kryptowire

116
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,349
have discovered that some

117
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,569
popular cheap Chinese smartphones

118
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,450
are sending your data to China,

119
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,599
where it could in theory

120
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,169
be accessed by the CCP.

121
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,169
The software came from

122
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,269
Shanghai Adups Technology.

123
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,330
It allowed them to “execute commands...

124
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,180
install apps, take screenshots,

125
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,550
record the screen,

126
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,000
make calls and wipe devices

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
without needing permission.”

128
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,620
Hopefully they weren’t using it

129
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,500
to talk to any subversive Chinese chatbots.

130
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,750
And just when you thought things

131
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,860
couldn’t get any worse in China,

132
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,330
they started abusing...pandas.

133
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,670
This video showing zookeepers

134
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,750
roughing up pandas is going viral.

135
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,180
Now at first you might think this is

136
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,669
just another case of rampant animal abuse

137
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,889
inside zoos in China.

138
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,930
But state-run Xinhua interviewed the breeders

139
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,590
and it turns out it wasn’t abuse after all.

140
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,139
“I was feeding the baby pandas in the Moon
Nursery with Milk.

141
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,190
At the beginning it was gentle.

142
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,669
But suddenly it became grumpy,

143
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,530
maybe because it was irritated in some way

144
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,180
and bit us badly.

145
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,120
It bit us so badly that we tried to escape.”

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,520
Yes, it was gentle,

147
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,669
then became grumpy,

148
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:18,970
then tried to bite,

149
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,810
so the caretaker had no choice

150
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,570
but to throw it across the floor.

151
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,970
But seriously, when it comes to abusing pandas,

152
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,400
I think the issue is pretty black and white.

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,220
And finally, moving on to Botswana.

154
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,620
A country so powerful on the international
stage

155
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,680
that most people have no idea where it even
is.

156
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
It’s here,

157
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,889
next to South Africa.

158
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,270
Well, Botswana has a lot of important trade
with China,

159
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,510
especially in diamond exports.

160
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,910
So it was a bit surprising when the government

161
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,080
announced it would be granting a visa

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,639
to the Dalai Lama this month

163
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,350
for a mostly private visit.

164
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,039
Especially since its neighbor South Africa

165
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,319
has denied a visa to the Dalai Lama

166
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,419
three times at China’s request.

167
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,229
So the CCP is of course angry at Botswana,

168
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,970
saying the visit will harm China’s core
interests.

169
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,830
Botswana’s foreign minister replied by saying,

170
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,539
“the principle of non-interference

171
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,699
in the international affairs of other countries

172
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,750
is at the core of China’s foreign policy...

173
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,319
We therefore expect...

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,319
China to respect

175
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,259
our sovereign decision on this matter.”

176
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,570
Sick burn.

177
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,169
I guess it truly takes a world superpower

178
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,140
like Botswana to stand up to the CCP.

179
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,800
You know who else is a world superpower

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,379
standing up to the CCP?

181
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,379
You!

182
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,990
That’s right, you,

183
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,650
my 50-Cent army that contributes

184
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,800
a dollar or more per episode

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,199
so we can keep making China Uncensored for
you.

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,770
If you’re not a member yet,
