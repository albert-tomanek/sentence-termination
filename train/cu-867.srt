1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
Where did the coronavirus begin?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,960
Was it of natural origin?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Or was the scientist who said that\h
just covering for his colleagues?

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,080
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,600
Before I start, did you know YouTube\h
demonetizes a lot of our videos?\h\h

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
Especially when they’re about\h
the coronavirus. That’s why\h\h

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,120
we rely on direct viewers support. Go to\h

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,160
An update on the coronavirus situation. First,\h
you may remember that early on last year,\h\h

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
scientists condemned the idea that the\h
coronavirus could have come from a Chinese lab.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Back in February 2020, U.S. scientist Dr.\h
Peter Daszak, president of the New York-based\h\h

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,320
EcoHealth Alliance, pushed back against that idea\h
in this article in the medical journal the Lancet.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy\h\h

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
theories suggesting that COVID-19\h
does not have a natural origin.”

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,160
He also wrote in a February 2020 email that\h
“Scientific evidence overwhelmingly suggests\h\h

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,000
that this virus originated in wildlife,\h
as have so many other emerging diseases.”

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Well it turns out the scientific evidence\h
wasn’t actually scientific evidence at all.\h\h

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
Last week, Dr. Daszak’s spokesperson told\h
the Wall Street Journal that actually,\h\h

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,200
“The Lancet letter was written during a time\h
in which Chinese scientists were receiving\h\h

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,320
death threats and the letter was intended as\h
a showing of support for them as they were\h\h

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,360
caught between important work trying to stop an\h
outbreak and the crush of online harassment.”

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Ok, that’s understandable that he\h
didn’t want Chinese scientists to get\h\h

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,320
death threats in the early days of the pandemic.\h
But then he wrote another article in June about\h\h

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,120
why the idea of the coronavirus coming\h
from a lab was a conspiracy theory.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Dr. Dazak’s statements are under scrutiny\h
because he’s one of the World Health Organization\h\h

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,480
investigators who are traveling to China to\h
investigate the origins of the coronavirus.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,600
But other scientists have brought up some pretty\h
big conflict of interest problems. That’s because\h\h

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,200
“Dr. Daszak has been a longtime\h
collaborator of Dr. Shi [Zhengli]\h\h

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,960
since they worked together to trace SARS\h
viruses to bats after the 2003 epidemic.”

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,960
Dr. Shi’s work studying bat coronavirus at the\h
Wuhan Institute of Virology has been theorized as\h\h

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,680
one of the possible origins\h
of the current pandemic.\h

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Over the past year, more and more\h
people have been questioning—could\h\h

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
the coronavirus have begun in a Chinese lab?

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,760
Once upon a time, you could get deplatformed\h
from social media for even suggesting that.

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
But the State Department recently suggested\h
that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of\h\h

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,640
Virology had a coronavirus-like\h
illness in the Autumn of 2019.

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,520
“The U.S. government has reason to believe\h
that several researchers inside the Wuhan\h\h

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Institute of Virology became sick in autumn 2019,\h
before the first identified case of the outbreak,\h\h

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,520
with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19\h
and common seasonal illnesses. This raises\h\h

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,960
questions about the credibility of senior\h
researcher Shi Zhengli’s public claim\h\h

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,040
that there was ‘zero infection’ among the Wuhan\h
Institute of Virology’s staff and students.”

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
It also says, “The CCP has prevented\h
independent journalists, investigators,\h\h

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,920
and global health authorities from interviewing\h
researchers at the [Wuhan Institute of Virology],\h\h

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
including those who were ill in the fall of 2019.\h\h

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,480
Any credible inquiry into the origin of\h
the virus must include interviews with\h\h

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,520
these researchers and a full accounting\h
of their previously unreported illness.”

46
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,280
So it really is possible that the coronavirus\h
leaked from a Chinese lab. Of course we don’t\h\h

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,120
know yet, as the investigation is still ongoing.\h
But this whole incident with Dr. Daszak just\h\h

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,720
goes to show: Sometimes conspiracy theories\h
just turn out to be investigative journalism.

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,840
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.\h
