1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,840
Protests erupt in southern China.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,910
People gave up farmland for an “eco-park”

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,600
But then learned the government had a secret
agenda.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,390
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,000
Big protests over the weekend—

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,970
and this time, not in Hong Kong.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,660
Ok, also in Hong Kong.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,119
But I’m talking about the protests in Wenlou.

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,260
Wenlou is a small township in Guangdong province.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,670
It’s a couple hundred miles west of Hong
Kong.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,410
Local authorities had asked residents there

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,100
to give up their farmland

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,680
so they could build a 24-acre park.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,910
They dubbed it the “Huazhou Humanity and
Ecology Park.”

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,640
Which sounds just lovely.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,410
But then last week, residents found out a
dirty little secret:

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,930
The “Humanity and Ecology Park”

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,230
would also contain a crematorium—

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,870
you know, to burn bodies of dead people.

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,489
I don’t think that local residents

22
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,880
were expecting the park to have that kind
of humanity.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
And when residents found out,

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,400
they were not happy.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,540
Last Thursday, they went to the local government
office to protest.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,270
Residents had felt cheated because authorities

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,970
kept the crematorium secret.

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,530
Residents were also worried the crematorium

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,500
would cause pollution and contaminate the
water supply.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,770
Plus, you know, burning dead people near

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,600
a residential area is really bad feng shui.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,340
“The [site] is close to housing and the
source of our drinking water,”

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,440
a woman told the South China Morning Post.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,049
“We’re afraid of pollution.

35
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,720
We don’t want money or compensation,

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,540
we just want the crematorium project scrapped.”

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,880
So Chinese authorities did what Chinese authorities
do best.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,850
They sat down for a dialogue with local protest
leaders and... just kidding.

39
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,880
They sent in the riot police.

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,460
These people held a banner that says

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,220
“Love our beautiful Wenlou town,

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,290
say NO to crematorium.”

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,479
Of course you need riot police!

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,700
Holding a banner is very subversive.

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,560
If you really loved your town,

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
you’d embrace the government’s plan

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,879
to burn dead people in the middle of it.

48
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,680
In any case, the protest didn’t end well.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,700
The police fired tear gas and charged at the
protesters.

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,209
Around 100 people were reportedly arrested

51
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,200
and a dozen or so were said to be injured—

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,239
including a child...

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,430
and this elderly woman who was allegedly beaten
by the police.

54
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,130
And there were other reports of police brutality,

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,530
including police dragging an unconscious young
protester

56
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,790
in an alley.

57
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,730
Definitely the kind of thing that would make
me want to go cow-tipping on police cars.

58
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,120
One resident told the Guardian that

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,800
“now police are like crazy dogs, beating
whoever they see.”

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,250
That’s a bit unfair.

61
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,379
In some cases,

62
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,570
the police didn’t beat people.

63
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,150
They just launched tear gas at them.

64
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
“Crazy dogs.”

65
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,380
Ha!

66
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,180
Find me a dog that can operate a tear gas
launcher.

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,330
At any rate, the protests in Wenlou are not
actually that unique in China.

68
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,430
There are tens of thousands of protests a
year across the country—

69
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,560
what central authorities call “mass incidents.”

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,830
Most of them are small,

71
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,800
often a dozen or fewer people.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,599
But occasionally mass incidents involve several
hundred

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,670
or even over a thousand people, like the one
in Wenlou.

74
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,550
But what really sets Chinese authorities on
edge is that Wenlou

75
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,690
is only a couple hundred miles from Hong Kong.

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,920
And they’re worried that subversive ideas
like freedom

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,420
and representative government could spread
from Hong Kong to other parts of China.

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
In the end,

79
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,010
authorities in Wenlou put a freeze on the
crematorium plan.

80
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,930
“But the stand-off between police and protesters
goes on.”

81
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,110
That’s because “the public had no confidence
in the government—

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,290
as it had agreed only to suspend the crematorium
project

83
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,709
rather than cancel it.”

84
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,019
Wow, that reminds me of Hong Kong,

85
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,510
where the government agreed only to suspend
a controversial extradition bill,

86
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,659
but not actually cancel it.

87
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,020
At least not until protests had gone on for
three months.

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,870
And by then, the protests had become

89
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,330
about a lot more than just the one extradition
bill.

90
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,379
Of course, there’s a key difference

91
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,659
between protests in Wenlou and Hong Kong.

92
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,900
Protesters in Wenlou are asking the local
government

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,030
to stop building a crematorium.

94
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,780
And the Communist Party can compromise,

95
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,250
by stopping construction,

96
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,020
and then throwing local officials under the
bus.

97
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,860
But in Hong Kong,

98
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,740
protesters are asking for freedom.

99
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,479
And that’s a serious threat to the Communist
Party’s power.

100
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,020
So they’re not going to compromise on that.

101
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,590
So what do you think about the crematorium
protests in Wenlou?

102
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,900
Leave your comments below.

103
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,210
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

104
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,580
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

105
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,490
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

106
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,470
Logan asks: “Does Chinese organized crime
have connections to the CCP?”

107
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,139
Well, that’s widely believed to be true,

108
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,610
but it’s hard to find solid evidence.

109
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,639
For example, in Hong Kong in July,

110
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,729
triad members dressed in white attacked protesters.

111
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,360
Why would they do that if they were not in
cahoots

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,080
with the police or government, right?

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,669
But again, just rumors, no solid proof.

114
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,550
The Chinese Communist Party has an organization

115
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,720
called the United Front.

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,270
Its members work with all sorts of groups—

117
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,630
community leaders, politicians,

118
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,680
organized crime, even religious authorities.

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,580
The goal of the United Front is to ensure
Chinese people

120
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,900
inside and outside China are loyal to the
Party.

121
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,240
But this kind of influence is done subtly,

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,440
so it’s hard to find specific orders like

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,240
“I’ll pay you X dollars to attack this
group.”

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
If you want to learn more,

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,450
I suggest you read “Silent Invasion:

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,600
China’s Influence in Australia”...

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,000
or “Claws of the Panda: Beijing's Campaign

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,990

129
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,350
Thanks for your question, Logan.
