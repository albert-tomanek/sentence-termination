(I m going to kill you MWHAHAHA!) Oh, hi.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:10,389
I didn t see you come in. Would you like some
tea? I have an extra cup right here. Logo

Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I m Chris
Chappell. So, if you re a Chinese dissident,

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:20,740
and you get an invitation to tea by authorities,
you can be pretty sure there s not going to

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,560
be much tea involved. s sort of like when
Chinese police burst into the homes of activists

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,690
in the middle of the night to suggest they
go on a vacation, and get out of Beijing for

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,210
a couple of days during politically sensitive
events. Last week there were massive protests

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,300
outside the Southern Weekly, a Chinese newspaper
that actually isn t state-run. The paper had

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,310
tried to run an article calling for a constitutional
government, but then the local propaganda

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,500
chief Tuo Zhen took it upon himself to make
a slight edit. He rewrote it to praise the

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,130
CCP. And gosh, China must really be changing
because usually large protests are met with

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,430
brutality. But this time, authorities just
invited everyone to tea! I mean, look at how

13
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,220
excited they are! It looks like they just
can t wait to get into that unmarked van.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,350
And here s a student being taken off for tea
after his interview with Second German Broadcast

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,460
Network. Look, how nice! They re carrying
him so he doesn t have to walk. It must have

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,100
been quite the tea party because they even
invited celebrities. Taiwanese singer Annie

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,820
Yi also spoke out on behalf of Southern Weekly,
and someone must have been listening because

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,310
she later said on her Weibo, which is like
a Chinese Twitter, that authorities also invited

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,560
her to drink tea. That was before a bunch
of her Weibo posts were mysteriously taken

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,600
down. In fact, at least 20 people have been
invited to drink tea with authorities in relation

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,500
to the Southern Weekly incident alone, including
famous Beijing entrepreneur Li Kaifu and property

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,640
developer Ren Zhiqiang. Tea drinking began
in China 4,000 years ago, and plays a huge

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,270
role in Chinese culture. That s probably why
authorities can t get enough tea parties.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,080
In fact, to help them out, they ve recently
made a new law that Internet providers and

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,180
social media sites have to register the real
names of users. That way, if someone posts

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,459
something critical of the government, it s
even easier to invite them to tea and discuss

27
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,486
their differences over tea. How civilized.
