00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,750
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,620
let’s visit the Chinese territory of Macau—

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,049
to see how how rich mainlanders

4
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,220
are getting their money out of China.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,060
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
You know what’s great about

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,830
being a Chinese millionaire?

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,509
Apparently, not being in China.

10
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,839
Nearly half of China’s wealthy

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,180
want to get out of the country.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,430
But before they move out,

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,000
they first want to get their money out.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,320
And one of the many ways they do

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,940
that is through the city of Macau.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,220
Macau is home to the world’s

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,070
most elaborate casinos,

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,730
as you know from James Bond.

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,280
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,430
That scene wasn't filmed in Macau?

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,030
It was done at Pinewood Studios in the UK?

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,550
What’s next,

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,280
are you going to tell me James Bond himself

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,420
isn’t a regenerating time lord

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,640
who changes his face

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,510
every three to seven movies?

27
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,170
I feel so lied to.

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,970
Anyway, Macau is here, in southern China.

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,719
It’s just across the water from Hong Kong.

30
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,030
Macau is part of China’s “One Country,
Two Systems” policy.

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,659
So Macau has its own government, currency,
and laws—

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,119
but it still belongs to the People’s Republic
of China.

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,689
It’s like Hong Kong,

34
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,499
but the good kid version.

35
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,759
You know, the obedient kid

36
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,990
who listens to your anti-subversion laws

37
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,010
and does the chores l

38
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,960
like laundering your money.

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,920
But anyway, Macau was a Portuguese colony

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,259
for four hundred years.

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,490
But eventually the Portuguese

42
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,369
got tired of being the only colonial power
left in Asia

43
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,429
and returned Macau to China in 1999.

44
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,689
It was two years after the Hong Kong handover,

45
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:42,950
and there was much less fanfare.

46
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,710
The good news is,

47
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,179
when the Portuguese went away,

48
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:49,119
they left their egg tarts behind.

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,119
Gambling had been a part of Macau

50
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,749
since the 1800s.

51
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,670
And after the 1999 handover,

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,619
it became the only place in China

53
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,729
where casino gambling is legal.

54
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,049
It’s also the only place in China

55
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,080
where komodo dragons roam free

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,920
in dangerously open pits,

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,590
as you know from James Bond.

58
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,049
Anyway, the real Macau

59
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,610
is in fact home to elaborate casinos,

60
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,380
more than 30 of them.

61
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Most of them have been built up

62
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,170
in the last 15 years.

63
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,190
But instead of looking like

64
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,510
exotic fantasies of the East,

65
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,960
the real casinos actually look like…

66
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,820
exotic fantasies of the West.

67
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,330
Macau is basically Las Vegas on steroids.

68
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,690
In 2016, Macau’s casino gambling revenue

69
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,070
was $28 billion,

70
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,990
which is three times more than Las Vegas.

71
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,870
And a lot of that money is coming from—

72
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,080
you guessed it—

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,360
Chinese millionaires.

74
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,940
80% of Macau’s tax revenue

75
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,420
is from the gambling industry.

76
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,130
And I’m not talking just about the 30 million

77
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,300
ordinary Chinese tourists each year

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,890
who go there just to gamble for fun.

79
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,800
The majority of Macau’s gambling revenue

80
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,850
actually comes from a small number

81
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,940
of mainland Chinese gamblers

82
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,680
referred to as VIP clients.

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,280
These VIP clients are China’s wealthy elite

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,960
who go there largely

85
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,590
to get their money out of China.

86
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,590
In recent years,

87
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,590
the Chinese government

88
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,820
has put restrictions on how much money

89
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,110
citizens can move out of China:

90
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,530
You can only transfer the equivalent

91
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,720
of fifty thousand US dollars a year.

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,540
So if you’re rich and want to move,

93
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,130
say, a million yuan,

94
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,970
which is three times the limit,

95
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,000
you need to find a way around that.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Fortunately, China’s wealthy have become

97
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,680
experts at getting around laws.

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,460
I mean, how do you think they became

99
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,940
wealthy in the first place?

100
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,890
Enter: the Macau casino industry.

101
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,870
Here’s how it works.

102
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,970
The casinos work with organizations called
junkets.

103
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,040
Imagine a junket like a cross between a bank

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,900
and a promotion company,

105
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
but often run by guys with shaved heads

106
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,310
and neck tattoos.

107
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,600
And the junkets promise casinos

108
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,370
that they’ll bring them VIP clients.

109
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,390
So let’s say you’re one of these VIP clients:

110
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,870
a Chinese millionaire who got your money from,

111
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,120
you know, totally legitimate sources

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,660
completely unrelated to corruption.

113
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,050
So there’s a casino.

114
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,990
And it hires the junket on commission.

115
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,600
The junket hires an agent inside mainland
China.

116
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,180
That agent finds you,

117
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,690
and sells you a VIP package

118
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,260
for one million yuan.

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,560
That VIP package might include transportation,

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,180
a free luxury hotel room,

121
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,849
plus a million yuan worth of “free” casino
chips

122
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,759
that just happen to be included as a bonus.

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,759
This way,

124
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,370
you’re technically paying for the package,

125
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,830
not the chips.

126
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,830
That makes it legal.

127
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,740
But there’s a catch:

128
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,300
Those casino chips cannot be

129
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,740
exchanged for cash.

130
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,150
They’re called non-negotiable chips,

131
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,610
or rolling chips.

132
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,780
You actually have to travel to the casino
in Macau

133
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,710
and gamble all of them.

134
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,539
But any chips you win back,

135
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,370
well, those will be negotiable chips.

136
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,889
Which you can exchange for cash.

137
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,770
So once you’ve spent enough time gambling

138
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,610
that you’ve wagered all your non-negotiable
chips

139
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,569
and hopefully won back most of them or more

140
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,400
in negotiable chips,

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,659
you can go cash them in for any currency you
want—

142
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,999
like US dollars—

143
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,249
and then do whatever you please

144
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:05,439
with that money.

145
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,029
You won that money fair and square...

146
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,849
outside mainland China!

147
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:12,330
No more 50-thousand-dollar transfer limits.

148
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,319
So you can invest your new winnings

149
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,389
in a sensible, diverse portfolio—

150
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,800
or blow it all on one wild party...

151
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
with a hot tub,

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
in a limousine,

153
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
on a yacht,

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,710
on a much larger yacht.

155
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,150
Or buy high-end real estate in New York City.

156
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,629
Anyway, Chinese millionaires

157
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,419
love the Macau junket system.

158
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,180
The junkets give them fancy hotel rooms for
free,

159
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,320
and set them up to gamble

160
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,040
in beautiful casino VIP rooms like this.

161
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,529
The favorite game of VIPs is baccarat.

162
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:41,880
And not just because they’ve seen it

163
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,260
in James Bond movies.

164
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,440
It’s because baccarat

165
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,379
has lowest chance of losing money

166
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,430
compared with other games.

167
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,520
I mean, statistically you’ll still lose
over time—

168
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,310
but it’s less than 3% on average.

169
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,689
But if you play blackjack or roulette,

170
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,360
you’ll lose much more than that over time.

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,580
So a lot of gamblers just stick with baccarat,

172
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,439
and just consider it a small fee

173
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,080
to turn Chinese yuan into any currency they
want.

174
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,969
Plus they get a swanky hotel room

175
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,159
and the VIP treatment.

176
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,879
Now you might think this whole system of gambling

177
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,599
and shady junkets is just a way

178
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,789
for corrupt officials to launder money

179
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,830
and skirt the currency transfer laws.

180
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,830
And you’d be right.

181
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,909
That’s EXACTLY what it is.

182
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,940
So...then why doesn’t the Chinese Communist
Party

183
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,030
just shut it down?

184
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,539
I mean, on one hand,

185
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,889
corrupt officials are using it

186
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,659
to move money out of China

187
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,370
without technically breaking the law.

188
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,729
This makes it harder for Xi Jinping

189
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,319
to go after them with his anti-corruption
campaign.

190
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,669
Plus on a large scale

191
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,930
it sucks money out of the Chinese economy.

192
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,620
But, on the other hand,

193
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,419
VIP clients are a huge part of Macau’s economy.

194
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,279
Macau’s gambling and tourism industries

195
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,020
would pretty much collapse without them.

196
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,100
And the CCP doesn’t want that to happen
either.

197
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,960
There are a lot of well-connected Party officials

198
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,099
who directly profit from Macau.

199
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,900
And from a bigger picture,

200
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,400
Macau is supposed to be the shining example

201
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,559
of how your economy will be great

202
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,490
after you give up control of your territory

203
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,470
to the People’s Republic of China—

204
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,229
hint, hint, Taiwan.

205
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,839
But if the VIP money stops rolling through,

206
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,040
it will be pretty obvious t

207
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,340
hat the entire system is a corrupt sham—

208
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,520
and that would be a huge embarrassment for
the Party.

209
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
So the CCP is between a rock and a hard place.

210
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,539
It’s like when you fall into a pit,

211
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,681
and on one hand there’s a komodo dragon

212
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,249
that wants to eat you,

213
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,249
but on the other hand

214
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,530
you can’t escape because there’s

215
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,680
a gangster trying to kill you.

216
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,879
I guess there’s no way out.

217
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,080
