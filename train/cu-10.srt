1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,800
The US and Japan are teaming up

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,280
For a massive naval drill

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,440
And China is the reason

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
Japan and the United States are\h
doing joint military drills!

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,280
You know, there’s been a lot of news\h
about military operations lately.\h\h

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
I wonder if that says anything about\h
where global China relations are headed?

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
Now before I tell you more, did you know 60%\h
of you who watch the show aren’t subscribed?\h\h

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,400
If you like the show, go ahead and subscribe.\h
And if you already have, check and make sure\h\h

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,640
you’re still subscribed. YouTube has a habit\h
of unsubscribing people without telling them.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,480
So these drills are obviously\h
all about China. Carl Schuster,\h\h

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
a former director of operations at the US\h
Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center,\h\h

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
said “The large-scale exercises have\h
strong ‘deterrent value’ toward China.”

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
The drill is known as Keen Sword 21.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,320
Uhh, that’s the official name,\h
but not the official branding.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
These drills between the US and Japan have\h
happened every 2 years for the past 30 years.\h

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,560
They involve dozens of warships,\h
hundreds of aircraft and 46,000\h\h

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,480
soldiers, sailors and marines\h
from Japan and the United States.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,360
And in 2020, for the first time, it will\h
include cyber and electronic warfare training.

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,560
Japan’s biggest warship, the Kaga, was joined by\h
the US aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,120
The Kaga will be refitted\h
to be able to carry the F-35\h\h

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,000
stealth fighter jet within the next two years.\h

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,840
That follows a 23 billion-dollar sale\h
back in July for 147 F-35s to Japan.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,520
The fighter jets supplement Japan’s\h
homemade fighting force, obviously.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Now there are a couple key things to keep\h
in mind about these joint naval drills.\h

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Number 1—this is the first big US Japan military\h
drill since Japan got its new prime minister,\h\h

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Yoshihide Suga. And there were concerns\h
that maybe he wouldn’t carry through on\h\h

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,160
the tough-on-China policies that his\h
predecessor, Shinzo Abe believed in.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,960
That’s looking like it won’t be\h
an issue. According to Reuters,\h\h

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Suga has vowed “to continue [Japan’s]\h
military build-up aimed at countering China.”

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
Earlier last month, Suga sent three vessels to\h\h

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
the South China Sea in an anti-submarine\h
exercise—also aimed at countering China.

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,680
Plus, Suga has been meeting with\h
countries in Southeast Asia,\h\h

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,520
like Vietnam and Indonesia—also to counter China.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
You see, Japan and all these countries surrounding\h
the South China Sea have something in common.\h\h

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
Territorial disputes with China.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,040
Which brings me to my 2nd big point. China\h
claims pretty much the entire South China Sea.\h\h

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
China also claims islands in the East\h
China Sea that Japan says belongs to\h\h

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,160
Japan. These are the Senkaku Islands, or\h
Diaoyu Islands as they’re known in China.

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
This month, China sent two Coast Guard\h
ships into these disputed waters.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,640
“It marked the 21st time this year that\h
Chinese boats have entered Japanese waters.”

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,200
So China has become more and more aggressive. That\h
seems to be the theme of the year, doesn’t it?

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
Japan has a mutual defense\h
treaty with the United States. So\h\h

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,760
in the event of a Chinese attack,\h
the US is obligated to respond. Hence\h\h

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
military drills, where the two\h
militaries practice working together.

46
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,960
“Lt. Gen. Kevin Schneider,\h
commander of US Forces Japan,\h\h

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,360
said the exercises would demonstrate the ability\h
of the US-Japan alliance ‘to deliver combat troops\h\h

48
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,080
to defend the Senkakus or respond\h
to other crises or contingencies.’"

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
So yeah, these drills are specifically\h
related to the disputed islands.

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
Back in July, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\h\h

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,520
“included the Senkakus dispute as one of the\h
areas in the Indo-Pacific where he said China\h\h

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,120
was ‘instigating territorial disputes’ as part\h
of a pattern of “bullying” its Asian neighbors.

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,640
Which in a way, is kind of ironic.\h
The Chinese Communist Party is using\h\h

54
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,400
these strongman tactics against all its\h
neighbors to seem tough. But the result is\h\h

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
all China’s neighbors are now getting\h
into alliances aimed at countering\h\h

56
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,920
China. So it actually puts China in a weaker\h
position than if they just hadn’t done anything.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
Speaking of which:\h\h

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,120
This month, the US and Japan will be joining India\h
and Australia for even more joint military drills.\h\h

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,160
Those are called the Malabar drilling ls. And\h
these four countries have an alliance known as\h\h

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,360
the Quad—a regional alliance geared toward\h
countering the Chinese Communist Party.\h

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
Now maybe all these joint military\h
drills are leaving you feeling a bit\h\h

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,240
anxious. Like something bad’s going to happen.\h
Well don’t worry. “In coordination with public\h\h

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,400
health and military medical personnel, every\h
aspect of Keen Sword is continually being assessed\h\h

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,480
to ensure appropriate Covid-19\h
mitigation measures are taken.”

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
That’s what you were worried about, right?

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,280
Of course China doesn’t want to feel left out\h
while everybody is doing joint military drills.\h\h

67
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
So China is doing their own joint\h
military drills. With themselves.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,120
“China’s People’s Liberation Army is in the\h
midst of two sets of military exercises in the\h\h

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, according to a posting\h
on the PLA’s official English language website.\h\h

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,080
The nature of the exercises was not disclosed.”

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
And China would just like to remind you,\h
“its intentions in the region are peaceful.”

72
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,080
Great! Nothing to worry about then.\h

73
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,440
And now, it’s time for me to answer\h
another question from one of you,\h\h

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,200
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Tim Ellington asks “Since Covid began I've\h
been waiting for the national media to go\h\h

76
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,160
back to paying attention to the Hong Kong protests\h
but they seem distracted. What a lucky accident\h\h

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,960
for the CCP! Wait - was it an accident? Am\h
I turning into a conspiracy theorist now?

78
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Well Tim, I can tell you the\h
Chinese Communist Party has\h\h

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,520
definitely used the coronavirus\h
to its advantage in Hong Kong.\h

80
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
Obviously while the coronavirus\h
lockdown was in effect,\h\h

81
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,760
mass protests like this two million person\h
march we went to last year became impossible.

82
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,440
And while things were in lockdown,\h
a wave of arrests happened.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,920
These included “prominent pro-democracy figures\h
in politics, civil society and the media”.

84
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
The CCP also never really\h
liked that Hong Kong holds an\h\h

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
annual memorial for the Tiananmen Square Massacre.\h\h

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Well this year, because of the coronavirus, you\h
know, Hong Kong officials banned the gathering.

87
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,160
But that only fueled more resentment\h
towards the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Which I’m sure will have a big impact on\h
Hong Kong legislative council elections.\h\h

89
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,640
Except...those were also postponed\h
for a year over virus concerns.

90
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,000
Does that mean it's a conspiracy? Well,\h
I prefer to think the Chinese Communist\h\h

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,840
Party is just filled with optimists! When\h
life gives you lemons, make lemonade. When\h\h

92
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,480
life gives you a deadly global pandemic that\h
you caused, take away Hong Kong's freedoms.

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,160
Thanks for your question, Tim.\h
If that is your real name.

94
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,400
And thank you for watching. Remember, it's\h
hard for us to keep this show running.\h\h

95
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,920
There’s not a lot of money in criticizing China.\h\h

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Which is why we rely on your support on the\h
crowd funding website Patreon. For as little as\h\h
