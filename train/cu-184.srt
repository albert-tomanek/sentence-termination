1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,120
China threatens to nuke Japan

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,640
Continuously

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,839
If Japan defends Taiwan

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:31,430
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,340
Last week, I told you Japan’s deputy Prime
Minister Taro Aso said Japan would go to war

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,910
if China invaded Taiwan.

7
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,840
By the way, that episode was not only demonetized,
but age-restricted.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,930
Which was a shame because it got 1.5 million
views before YouTube decided to kill it.

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,550
The reason I bring this up is because there’s
a nonzero chance the same thing could happen

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,560
with today’s episode.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,360
Since China has responded to Japan’s threat.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,970
By saying it will nuke Japan.

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,549
And I’m able to bring you this story despite
YouTube shenanigans thanks to the support

14
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,210
of everyone watching who contributes to China
Uncensored on the crowd funding website Patreon.

15
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,499
Join us in the fight to expose the Chinese
Communist Party to the world with as little

16
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:24,079
as a dollar per episode on Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

17
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,509
So with the show’s basic survival out of
the way, here’s the story.

18
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,280
Right after this quick commercial break.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,079
Just kidding, I’m not going to bother this
time.

20
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,609
So China has threatened not only to nuke Japan
if it defends Taiwan.

21
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,319
They threatened to continuously nuke Japan
if they send even just one soldier.

22
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,319
Here’s the video.

23
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,579
When we liberate Taiwan, if Japan dares to
intervene by force, even if it only deploys

24
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:56,680
one soldier, one plane, and one ship, we will
not only return reciprocal fire, but also

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,310
start a full scale war against Japan.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,560
We will use nuclear bombs first.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,060
We will use nuclear bombos continuously, until
Japan declares unconditional surrender for

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,189
the second time.

29
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:12,180
Now, when the Chinese Communist Party first
developed nuclear weapons, they promised never

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,079
to use them against a country that doesn’t
have nukes.

31
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:22,290
They said they would “unconditionally refrain
from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,319
against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free
zones.”

33
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,709
Japan doesn’t have nukes.

34
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,069
But I guess the Chinese regime is making an
exception.

35
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,280
The video was first posted to a video sharing
platform called Xigua.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,219
Xigua by the way is owned by Bytedance, the
same Chinese company that owns TikTok.

37
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:52,330
The video was posted by a military commentary
channel, “approved by the CCP and with close

38
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,430
ties to the People’s Liberation Army.”

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,510
Which wouldn’t have been such a big deal.

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,689
People say all kinds of idiot things on the
internet.

41
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,920
I should know.

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,480
But then it started getting shared and reposted
by local Chinese Communist Party committees.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,329
So this went from being a video posted by
some quack on the internet, to being a message

44
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,909
approved by the Chinese Communist Party.

45
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,239
Of course, since this was posted by local
Party committees, the Central government has

46
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,590
plausible deniability.

47
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,209
Was this just some local Party official getting
a tad too patriotic?

48
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,099
Or is this a message the Chinese Communist
Party wants to send Japan?

49
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,420
Like I said, plausible deniability.

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,340
Now after this became international news,
the original video was deleted.

51
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,930
Obviously not before everyone made copies.

52
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,060
The channel also posted a second video that
talks about how China should invade Japan

53
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,900
and the aftermath of the nuclear war.

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,989
It was also deleted.

55
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,700
The video suggests that China and Russia should
simultaneously attack Japan, while North Korea

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,800
might want to use the opportunity to also
invade South Korea.

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,049
And after they’ve completely destroyed Japan
as a country, China will break up Japan’s

58
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:18,030
four main islands into four independent countries
under the supervision of China and Russia.

59
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,690
We certainly have a lot to look forward to
in a world dominated by the Chinese Communist

60
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,380
Party.

61
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,310
But in a twisted way, the CCP is actually
making the argument for Japan.

62
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,590
When Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso said Japan
would fight if China invaded Taiwan, he was

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,380
arguing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would
threaten the survival of Japan.

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,850
Yeah, kind of sounds like it.

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,950
Of course you could say, Chris you’re just
some idiot on the internet who’s blowing

66
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,290
this way out of proportion.

67
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,220
It’s not like this was an official video!

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:59,760
Right, it’s not like last year, when the
People’s Liberation army released this highly

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,440
produced video showing an attack on the US
air force base in Guam.

70
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,890
Huh, I wonder if we should actually listen
to what the CCP is saying about attacking

71
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,430
all of us.

72
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,880
Naw, probably should still invest in Chinese
bonds.

73
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,730
And now, as a thank you to fans who keep this
show alive by contributing on Patreon, I’ll

74
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,700
answer one of their questions.

75
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,300
JasCam asks, “Chris, would appreciate your
thoughts on whether an internal revolution

76
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,810
(aka Poland) or an international set of actions
(aka South Africa) have the best chance of

77
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,440
bringing the CCP down?”

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,630
Now that’s something I think about a lot.

79
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,650
It’s a really good question.

80
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,240
So on the one hand, the US still has tremendous
leverage over the Chinese Communist Party.

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,190
The Party is desperate for US dollars.

82
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,140
Recently I did a full episode about that.

83
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,760
I’ll put a link in the description.

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,800
Basically, without access to US dollars, the
Communist Party collapses.

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,550
Which is why the Party is desperately trying
to create its own international financial

86
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,900
system based on a digital currency.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,680
Eventually the US will lose this leverage.

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,900
And sadly, it seems like the US elite are
too invested in China.

89
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,440
It would require completely decoupling the
US and Chinese economy.

90
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,890
They don’t want to do that.

91
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,860
And so likely, someday in the not too distant
future, China will decouple its economy from

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,440
ours when they no longer need us.

93
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,230
So how about an internal revolution?

94
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,210
It’s hard to know exactly how people inside
China feel about the Chinese regime, for obvious

95
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,710
reasons.

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,330
Certainly if the Party couldn’t promise
economic prosperity, people would rise up.

97
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,720
But that also depends on what the West does.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,980
The Party has been pushing 30 years of patriotic
education to brainwash the youth of China.

99
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,150
It’s been pretty successful.

100
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,350
But the Party is also riddled with factional
infighting, corruption, and an incredibly

101
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,420
shaky economy.

102
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,320
What I think will ultimately happen is these
internal problems will cause the collapse

103
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,420
of the Chinese Communist Party.

104
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,770
And any Western country still tied to the
Chinese regime will suffer greatly for it.

105
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,000

JasCam.
