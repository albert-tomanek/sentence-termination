1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,400
Time to inherit the red gene

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,590
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is pushing a moral
revolution

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,940
And it’s as insane as it sounds.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,060
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,500
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,470
China today is faced with challenged

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,480
heaped atop more challenges.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,980
A slowing economy.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,820
Environmental destruction

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,820
And social unrest.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,150
But don’t you worry about China.

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,680
Because Chinese leader Xi Jinping has the
answer.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,659
Inject a little bit of that good old fashioned
Communist morality.

14
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,920
That’s worked so well before!

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,409
In newly issued state approved morality guidelines,

16
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,769
Xi is telling people to inherit the red gene.

17
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,640
Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of gingers
in China.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,269
So I assume inheriting the red gene

19
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,690
will be achieved through forced genetic engineering.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,420
Humane forced genetic engineering.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,190
Anyway, if an authoritarian regime

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,129
accused of grotesque human rights violations

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,600
telling people they need to be more moral
seems odd to you,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,320
your red gene really isn’t working right.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,039
I suggest a trip to the Shanxi brain cleansing

26
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,829
and gene therapy center.

27
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,110
The new moral guidelines are being called,

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,940
“Outline for Implementing the Moral Construction

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,670
of Citizens in the New Era.”

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,330
Wow, inspiring.

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,570
It involves a lot of studying Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism

32
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,350
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,579
They’re really into this new era stuff.

34
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,020
The guidelines focus on the citizen's duty

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,060
in “bearing the great responsibility of
national rejuvenation.”

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,260
In other words, if the ship goes down,

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,240
it's your fault, not his.

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,009
Should have been a better communist.

39
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,750
To help with all this,

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,280
is the brand new app from party mouthpiece
People’s Daily,

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,840
the Chain on Aspirations app.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,689
It allows you to pledge your loyalty

43
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,479
to the Communist Party on blockchain.

44
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,789
So it can exist in cyberspace forever.

45
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,920
It’s like a virtual time capsule.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,420
You write down things like,

47
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,929
why you joined the Communist Party—

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,370
for the money—

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,230
and then the capsule will open up

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,730
on the Party’s anniversary each year,

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,510
a constant reminder of why

52
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,140
you pledged your life to the Party—

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,209
for the money.

54
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,280
“The app has been dubbed the digital version

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,099
of Mao's Little Red Book,

56
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,780
and it awards points for consuming Party propaganda.

57
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,750
Passing an exam in the app

58
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,680
is even required now for journalists.”

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,849
But the moral revolution doesn’t stop in
the cyber world.

60
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,690
It also coming to subways throughout China.

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,870
China is banning eating, drinking,

62
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,720
and other uncivilized behavior.

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,209
What counts as uncivilized?

64
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,240
Fortunately that’s been left vague enough

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,879
to ensure the kind of arbitrary enforcement

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,780
we’ve come to expect from those beloved
local Party cadres.

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,470
And finally, in a crack down on pornography

68
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,150
the Communist Party is targeting Christians.

69
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,390
I mean, look at this smut.

70
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,200
Do they know no shame?

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,430
Oh wait...they do, that’s the whole point.

72
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,110
Anyway, the Party has started a yet another
campaign,

73
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,459
this time “to eradicate pornography and
illegal publications.”

74
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,329
And you know what’s an illegal publication.

75
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,360
No.

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,299
I think I’m going to be sick.

77
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,550
No, I’m talking about non-Party approved
Bibles.

78
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,920
Also, one local government released this open
letter,

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,610
titled “All the People Must Take Action

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,709
and Fully Carry Out Work to ‘Clean Up Gang
Crime

81
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,370
and Eliminate Evil’

82
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,600
and ‘Eradicate Pornography

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,730
and Illegal Publications’ in the Religious
Field!”

84
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,560
Translation:

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,519
anything Christians say or do in public or
online in China

86
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,780
will be heavily monitored and censored.

87
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,650
So...maybe a vow of silence is in order?

88
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,319
Hmm, no, then you wouldn’t be able to praise
Xi Jinping.

89
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,060
Ah well.

90
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,580
So what do you think of the moral revolution
of China?

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,090
Will it stink as bad as the toilet revolution?

92
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,700
Let me know what you think below.

93
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,880
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

94
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,250
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

95
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,200
See you next time.
