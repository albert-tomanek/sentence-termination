1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,710
Trump singles out China at the UN

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,150
China is spreading AI Surveillance

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,010
And NASA fears China’s space aggression

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,880
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,380
This is China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,199
This week’s China news headlines!

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,890
A major confrontation at the recent UN summit!

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,980
A showdown we’ve all been waiting for.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,120
No, not Trump and Greta Thunberg.

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,170
I’m talking about the showdown between Trump
and China.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,550
We all knew it was coming.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,559
On Sunday, before the start of the summit,

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,289
Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,550
the Communist Party’s attempts to erase

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,399
the mostly Muslim Uighur ethinc minority.

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,339
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman retorted

17
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,069
that the US has “slandered China’s policy
toward Xinjiang

18
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,350
and grossly interfered in China’s internal
affairs."

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,100
Trump himself singled out China on trade issues

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,110
and took aim at China’s claim to be a developing
country.

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,590
“The second largest economy in the world

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,890
should not be permitted to declare itself
a developing country

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,090
in order to game the system at others’ expense.”

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,149
Backing that call is the Australian Prime
Minister.

25
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,170
He also said that as a developed nation,

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,619
China must do its part to combat climate change.

27
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,031
Which I assume means Greta Thunberg

28
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,869
will soon be making a trip to Beijing

29
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,710
to protest climate change.

30
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,829
Where she will *not* be invited to give a
speech.

31
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,540
Meanwhile, back at the UN,

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,380
President Trump had a message of support for
Hong Kong.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,840
The world fully expects that the Chinese government

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,110
will honor its binding treaty made with the
British

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,259
and registered with the United Nations

36
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,549
in which China promises to protect Hong Kong's
freedom,

37
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,719
legal system, and democratic way of life.

38
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,950
I’m sure Chinese authorities will get right
on that.

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,789
And in a final act of trolling,

40
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,630
the US invited Taiwan to the UN.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,880
Specifically, to a UN meeting that the US

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,420
was hosting on religious freedom.

43
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,569
Taiwan has been trying for years to join the
UN,

44
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,840
and China has been trying for years to block
them

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
from joining the UN.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,650
In fact, this religious freedom meeting

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,239
is the first time Taiwan has participated

48
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,220
in a UN event since 1971.

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,849
Also at the same meeting, the US invited the
daughter

50
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,750
of imprisoned Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti to
speak.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,160
I think I know where this is headed.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
And in another move that’s bound to make

53
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,250
Chinese authorities extremely uncomfortable,

54
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,690
a well-known lawyer has urged the United Nations
t

55
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,180
o investigate forced organ harvesting in China.

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,909
Lawyer Hamid Sabi from the UK

57
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,450
presented the findings of the China Tribunal,

58
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,030
which wrapped up in June this year.

59
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,590
The Tribunal concluded that Chinese hospitals

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,410
are “cutting out the hearts and other organs
from living,

61
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,209
blameless, harmless, peaceable people,”

62
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,099
mainly Falun Gong practitioners.

63
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,079
Falun Gong is a Chinese meditation practice

64
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,879
with exercises that look a bit like Tai-Chi.

65
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,730
Chinese authorities banned it in 1999

66
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,739
after it became really, really popular,

67
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,200
but refused to organize itself under Party
control.

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,520
The solution?

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,340
Arrest them and send them to labor camps!

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,489
Falun Gong practitioners say the practice

71
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,870
helps them stay healthy and fit.

72
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,260
Chinese doctors agree.

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,330
Their organs sure are healthy—

74
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,810
and ready to be forcibly transplanted!

75
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,150
Sabi said this organ harvesting

76
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,180
“constitutes one of the worst mass atrocities
of this century.”

77
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,810
China is preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary

78
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,719
of the Communist takeover of China next week.

79
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,560
And by celebrate, I mean you’d better celebrate.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,330
And Tibet is celebrating!

81
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,489
The holiest temple in Lhasa has put up this
banner that says

82
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,180
“May the great Communist Party live for
ten thousand years.”

83
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,650
And that still doesn’t motivate you to celebrate,

84
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,269
just like King George III,

85
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,390
Beijing will send a fully armed battalion

86
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,909
to remind you of their love.

87
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,810
“There will be 59 formations

88
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,240
and joint military band with 15,000 personnel.

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,470
160 planes and 580 sets of equipment

90
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,500
are taking part in the parade,

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,690
which will be the biggest military parade
in recent years.”

92
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,810
But Beijing faces serious threats

93
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,470
that make even 15,000 armed troops

94
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,640
quiver in their shiny boots.

95
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,180
That’s why they've banned the most dangerous
elements:

96
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,750
kites and pigeons.

97
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Balloons too.

98
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,940
No, that’s not a joke.

99
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,060
The parade will pass along Tiananmen Square.

100
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,610
I personally can’t wait.

101
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,540
I don’t think I’ve seen so many tanks
in Tiananmen Square since...

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,190
never.

103
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,250
There were never any tanks here.

104
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,310
According to this study by

105
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,320
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
China

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,720
is supplying much of the world with AI surveillance
technology.

107
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,950
63 out of 176 countries surveyed used Chinese
AI tech.

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,950
At least 50 of those have gotten it from Huawei.

109
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,170
“There is also considerable overlap

110
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,050
between China’s Belt and Road Initiative

111
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,850
and AI surveillance—

112
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,490
thirty-six out of eighty-six BRI countries

113
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,600
also contain significant AI surveillance technology.”

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,110
And if you still somehow have doubts about

115
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,210
whether Chinese tech companies like Huawei
or Alibaba

116
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,820
are independent of the Chinese Communist Party,

117
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,850
don’t worry! The Chinese Communist Party

118
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,040
is working hard to erase your doubts.

119
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,290
Chinese officials in Hangzhou

120
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,200
“will assign government representatives

121
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,360
to work within 100 local companies including
Alibaba Group...

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,660
a new indication of the Chinese government’s

123
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,020
increasingly close monitoring of private companies.”

124
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,860
Bad news for Taiwan.

125
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,530
In less than a week after losing Solomon Islands

126
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,070
as a diplomatic ally,

127
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,450
Taiwan has now lost yet another one:

128
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,470
the island nation of Kiribati.

129
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,390
If you didn’t know, Kiribati is here.

130
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,350
Now sure, Kiribati only has a population roughly

131
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,330
the size of my apartment building in Queens.

132
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,700
But their pulling out means Taiwan now only
has

133
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,950
15 countries that officially recognize its
existence.

134
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,280
The Chinese Communist Party has vowed

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,780
to conquer Taiwan by 2020—

136
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,530
by force if necessary.

137
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,341
And as a Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman

138
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,080
said after nabbing Kiribati...

139
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,760
“What should happen will come sooner or
later.

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,100
Please remain calm, everyone should.”

141
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,310
Nice and cryptic.

142
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,130
According to the Congressionally funded

143
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,340
US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,

144
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,670
there’s been progress in the Trade War.

145
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,470
“The U.S. goods deficit with China totaled
$32.8 billion in July,

146
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,150
down 11 percent year-on-year.”

147
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,800
Meanwhile President Trump says the US is making
a lot of progress.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,730
He said “the United States is taking in
billions

149
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,260
from tariffs imposed on Chinese imports,

150
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,380
and the total would soon reach $100 billion.”

151
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Trade talks have resumed,

152
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,140
and the administration has lifted tariffs
on 400 Chinese goods,

153
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,670
things ranging from circuit boards,

154
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,850
to dog collars,

155
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,450
to miniature Christmas trees.

156
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,380
Trump says that’s because we’re winning.

157
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,550
But, depending on what media you read,

158
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,460
it's a sign we’re losing,

159
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,030
and “The administration is trying desperately

160
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,620
to reduce the pressure.”

161
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,450
So sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s
real from what’s fake.

162
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,510
Unless we’re talking about Impossible Foods,

163
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,360
the fake meat company.

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,500
They have plans to enter the China market
in the next year.

165
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,250
Which will be really confusing for the Chinese
Communist Party.

166
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,130
The typical modus operandi is to bring in
foreign companies,

167
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,800
steal their intellectual property,

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,890
and churn out a Chinese made knockoff.

169
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,230
But what will a knockoff of knockoff meat
look like?

170
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,100
On Tuesday, the head of NASA

171
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,520
accused China of aggressive space activity.

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,610
China has been developing anti-satellite technology
for years.

173
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,950
In fact, China was heavily criticized

174
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,330
for an anti-satellite missile test in 2007

175
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,770
that blew up one of their own satellites.

176
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,070
And created a giant cloud of space debris.

177
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,940
That’s something NASA’s head says they’re
going to fight.

178
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,580
“It’s important for people to understand

179
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,650
that we are not going to allow investments

180
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,880
that could potentially destroy space...

181
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,610
If we’re going to achieve what NASA wants
to achieve,

182
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,300
we can’t have people threatening to wreck
low-earth orbit.”

183
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,690
Perhaps most worrying of all was the new that
that’s no moon,

184
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,150
it’s a battle station.

185
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,140
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

186
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,630
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

187
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,420
a fan who support China Uncensored

188
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,650
with a dollar or more per episode,

189
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,329
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

190
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,159
Josiah faber asks,

191
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,560
“Have they stopped their belt and road initiative

192
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,370
since the trade war began,

193
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,089
as they have been losing so much money?”

194
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,810
Ah the Belt and Road lumbers on.

195
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,650
China has already invested a lot of money
around the world

196
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,529
through the Belt and Road Initiative.

197
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,730
Which means many countries still owe China
a lot of money.

198
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,060
As recently as March,

199
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,949
China nabbed its first G7 country, Italy,

200
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,769
for the Belt and Road.

201
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:01,950
But as countries around the world

202
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,839
have wised up to China’s debt trap diplomacy,

203
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,970
and as China faces more economic pressure

204
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,490
from the US-China trade war,

205
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,889
it’s been put on the defensive.

206
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:11,889
Since last year,

207
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,360
they’ve been talking about sustainable debt.

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,170
While also being forced to hold back money

209
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,740
from projects left unfinished.

210
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,850
But that doesn’t mean the Belt and Road
is over.

211
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,379
Not by a long shot.

212
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,930
Malaysia had become one of the toughest opponents

213
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,430
of the Belt and Road.

214
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,029
However, that changed in April this year.

215
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,449
“China has announced that it has persuaded
Malaysia

216
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,480
to resume a canceled rail project worth $10.7
billion.”

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,589
Because at the end of the day,

218
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,370
the Chinese Communist Party seeks world domination.

219
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,339
And the Belt and Road is a key part of that.

220
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,339
Thanks for your question.

221
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,550
And if you have a question for me

222
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,510
you want to hear answered on the show,

223
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,379
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

224
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,100
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

225
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,639
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

226
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,319
we would have to shut down the show

227
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,089
if it weren’t for your support.

228
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:01,779
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

229
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,560
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

230
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,440
See you next time.
