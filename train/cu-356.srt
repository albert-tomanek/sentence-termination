00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,230
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,410
Apple: the company known for giving users

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,419
loads of choices and freedom

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,120
to use their products however they want—

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,160
just broke my irony meter.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,949
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
Boy folks,

9
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,029
what a month it’s been!

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,170
China Uncensored launched a brand new website,

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,279
thanks in part to the Youtube adpocalypse…

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,070
...and we launched on Roku, Amazon Fire TV,

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,680
and last but definitely least,

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,800
Apple TV.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,180
It was a shock when we received

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,120
a notice from Apple saying they removed

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
the China Uncensored App from Hong Kong

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
and Taiwan.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,660
Apparently because the show is illegal there?

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,760
Strange that I don't remember

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,359
narrowly escaping prison

22
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,309
when we went to Hong Kong and Taiwan last
year

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,699
and met with multiple government officials.

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,429
I wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook

25
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,530
at the beginning of the month

26
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,679
asking for an explanation,

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,511
and a demand to put the China Uncensored app

28
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,530
on the app stores there.

29
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,750
And we started a petition!

30
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,320
Which I'm sure everyone watching this

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
has signed.

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,900
Because you're all good people.

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,240
Tim Cook has not yet responded to my letter.

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,810
And I couldn’t figure out why.

35
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,340
But now I think I’ve got my answer!

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,960
He’s been too busy

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,130
winning the Free Speech Award

38
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,010
from the Newseum in Washington DC.

39
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,010
The Newseum,

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,530
besides being the all-time winner

41
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,909
of the punniest museum name,

42
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,479
also "promotes, explains and defends free
expression

43
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,590
and the five freedoms of the First Amendment."

44
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,180
Which sounds great.

45
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,230
And they have some pretty cool exhibits.

46
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,500
Like an entire section of the Berlin Wall

47
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,729
with an East German guard tower.

48
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,420
And a memorial dedicated to journalists

49
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,360
who have died reporting the news.

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,930
And a permanent exhibit on...

51
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,340
the First Dogs?

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay...

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,579
Uh, back to the Free Expression awards.

54
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,670
The awards honor people who

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,299
“have taken personal or professional risks

56
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,829
in sharing critical information with the public,

57
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,940
have been censored or punished by authorities

58
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,060
or other groups for their work,

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,040
or have pushed boundaries in artistic

60
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,379
and media expression.”

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,540
That's why Playboy founder Hugh Hefner

62
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,910
also won a Free Expression award.

63
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,459
I'm sure he got it just for the articles.

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,040
Tim Cook gave the longest

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,730
victory speech of the night.

66
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,260
According to Apple Insider,

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,510
he spoke of the importance

68
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,800
of freedom of speech,

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,629
“Not just the forms of speech

70
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,980
that entertain us,

71
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,849
but the ones that challenge us.

72
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,099
The ones that unnerve

73
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,040
and even displease us."

74
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,569
Wise words, Mr. Cook.

75
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,599
I totally agree.

76
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,930
In praise of Tim Cook,

77
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,760
Newseum made this video.

78
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,780
“We believe that a company that has values

79
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,840
can really change the world.

80
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,660
I think it's really important that

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,640
corporate leaders like Tim

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
care about principles like freedom of expression

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,740
and the advancement of human rights.

84
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,660
He takes risk at both a personal and a professional level

85
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,140
to engage in new ideas.

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
It’s not just about making money,

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,030
it’s also about making a difference

88
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,030
in the world.”

89
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,190
Yes, Apple:

90
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,220
making a difference in the world.

91
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,510
By doing things like being the Platinum Sponsor

92
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,840
of the 2017 Free Expression Awards.

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,220
I'm sure Tim Cook winning one of those very
awards

94
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,159
was a complete coincidence.

95
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,599
It's just like the time I won

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,819
the Best Host of a China-focused Comedy News
Show

97
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,330
Not Based in China award.

98
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,970
Right after I gave the hosting organization

99
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,939
two million dollars.

100
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,019
But let's talk about what Apple is doing in
China.

101
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,019
You see,

102
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,630
while Tim Cook was being honored

103
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,960
for his commitment to free speech,

104
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,819
Apple has been doing everything it can to
help

105
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,099
the Chinese Communist Party censor.

106
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,030
For example,

107
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,720
when the Chinese government asked Apple

108
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,190
to remove the New York Times

109
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,959
from the app store in China...

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,430
...along with a bunch of other

111
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,990
independent Chinese media...

112
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,569
...and an app that lets Chinese internet users

113
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,860
break through the Chinese Communist Party’s

114
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,200
Draconian Internet censorship firewall...

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,040
...plus of course China Uncensored...

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,590
they did it.

117
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,590
Because as Apple said,

118
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,880
“the content was ‘illegal’ in China.”

119
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,170
Sure, last year Apple told the FBI

120
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,540
they wouldn’t help in a terrorism investigation

121
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,010
for privacy and security reasons,

122
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,600
but that was the FBI!

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,980
The worst Apple could have faced

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,500
was probably a big fine.

125
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,920
But the Chinese Communist Party

126
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,670
could literally bring down

127
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,850
all of Apple’s operations in China

128
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,040
tomorrow, for any reason at all.

129
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,750
Even when they bend over backwards

130
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,920
to kowtow to the Party.

131
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Which just shows that they don't know

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,790
anything about kowtowing.

133
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,550
It’s just like how one day,

134
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,730
the Chinese government offices

135
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,590
decided to ban Windows 8

136
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,020
and replace it with a Chinese knockoff—

137
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,410
and there was nothing Microsoft

138
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,140
could do about it.

139
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,650
The Chinese Communist Party’s

140
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,500
arbitrary, highly politicized control of the
government

141
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,920
and the judicial system

142
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,820
strikes fear into the hearts of

143
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,750
every company operating in China.

144
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,470
So I understand why Apple is concerned.

145
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,340
They don’t just make iPhones in China.

146
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,170
China is also the world’s biggest consumer
of iPhones.

147
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,270
I mean, the Communist Party

148
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,430
could just ban the sales of iPhones tomorrow

149
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,200
in the entire country.

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,990
I know it sounds crazy,

151
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,360
but it briefly happened in Beijing last year.

152
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,710
So Apple is facing a real threat

153
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,020
to its bottom line in China.

154
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,570
But at least by being so morally flexible,

155
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,730
and doing what the Chinese government tells
them,

156
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,950
Apple has had smooth sailing in China.

157
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,950
Just kidding!

158
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,950
At every step of the way,

159
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,300
the Chinese regime has still made things

160
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,610
as difficult as possible.

161
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,130
In 2012,

162
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,000
Apple had to pay 60 million to a Chinese company

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,760
to get the rights to the name iPad in China,

164
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
because Chinese courts

165
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,520
wouldn’t grant Apple the trademark.

166
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,790
And in 2013,

167
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,230
CEO Tim Cook was forced to issue a humiliating
public apology

168
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,770
to Chinese consumers

169
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,050
after Chinese state-media

170
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,640
launched a largely false campaign

171
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,260
to smear Apple’s customer service reputation.

172
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,100
Then in 2016,

173
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,480
Chinese authorities shut down the iBooks store

174
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,850
and iTunes movies just a few months

175
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,740
after Apple launched them in China.

176
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Plus the whole iPhone6 ban

177
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I mentioned earlier.

178
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
And just this month,

179
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,360
Chinese authorities summoned Apple to court

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,790
over its app store.

181
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,350
So, I guess Apple has learned a lesson

182
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,530
from being the victim of arbitrary,

183
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,420
unfair actions by the Communist Party.

184
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,440
And that lesson is:

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,630
That’s how Apple ought to treat everyone
else!

186
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,950
So I’m not super surprised that Apple TV

187
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,740
banned China Uncensored in China.

188
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,570
Though I am surprised they banned our app

189
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,000
in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,790
Unless that's just some more of that

191
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,580
backwards kowtowing on the One-China policy.

192
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
But you know what?

193
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,950
I say, if Tim Cook is willing to accept the

194
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,870
Newseum’s Free Speech Award,

195
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,490
he should accept the responsibility it implies.

196
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,540
Mr. Cook:

197
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,670
Put your money where your mouth is

198
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,220
and make Apple stop removing media apps

199
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,030
from your app stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan,

200
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,550
as well as in mainland China.

201
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,550
Because remember,

202
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,820
“It’s not just about making money,

203
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,210
it’s also about making a difference in the world.”

204
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,260
So what do you think Apple should do

205
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,860
to make a difference in the world?

206
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,410
Leave your comments below.

207
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,100
And to further encourage Tim Cook and Apple

208
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,660
to make the right decision,

209
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,780
click the link below to sign our petition

210
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,500
to get the China Uncensored app back in the
Hong Kong

211
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,660
and Taiwan app stores.

212
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,630
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

213
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,350
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

214

see you next time.
