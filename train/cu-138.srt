1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,519
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:06,070
Wow, some crazy things happened in 2015.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,559
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:12,969
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,119
Well, it's that time of year again—

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,460
the end of the year to be exact—

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,740
the time when we all look back and try to
make sense of what went wrong.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,010
But before we crack out the leftover eggnog

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,340
and reflect on the missed opportunities that
are now gone forever,

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,800
let's take a look back at the ten biggest
stories from China in 2015.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,360
Number 10

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,510
Beijing Awarded the 2022 Olympics

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,550
Remember when China promised to clean up its
human rights act

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,920
ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics?

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,510
Well, they sort of did.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,850
I mean, they cleaned up the streets—

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,020
by taking pesky citizens off the streets and
locking them up.

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,690
But jailing political prisoners

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,610
didn't discourage the International Olympic
Committee in July this year

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,460
from awarding China the 2022 Winter Olympics.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,059
Not that they had many options.

22
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,899
The only other contender was Kazakhstan—

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,990
a country known primarily for the fictional
character Borat—

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,780
and for the very real suppression of human
rights.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,970
So why not pick China?

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,890
Sure, there's almost no snow in Beijing,

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,200
but why not pick China?

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Plus, China is already the gold medal champion

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,940
of making fake goods.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,250
In fact they've already started practicing.

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,600
Just listen to their official Olympic song!

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,700
"A kingdom of isolation,

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
and it looks like I'm the queen"

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,200
Sorry, that was "Let It Go" from Disney's
Frozen.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Here's their official Olympic song.

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:49,100
「一幅画整装待发约定天地之大」

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,100
"It's funny how some distance

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,400
makes everything seem small"

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,300
「一个家五彩肤色绽放和平之花」

40
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,049
Number 9

41
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,810
Chinese Doctor Wins the Nobel Prize

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,560
In October, Dr. Tu Youyou

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
became the first female Chinese doctor to
win the Nobel Prize.

44
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,150
It was for discovering a cure for malaria...

45
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,130
back in the 70s.

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,640
A little late?

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,360
Well, only for the millions of people who
died each year from malaria,

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,580
for thirty years,

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,319
while waiting for the cure to be made public.

50
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,760
Dr. Tu found an herb that traditional Chinese
medicine

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,150
used to treat malaria two thousand years ago.

52
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,319
So she refined it into a useable drug.

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,319
For human trials, she tested it on herself.

54
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,050
Number 8

55
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,330
The Social Credit System

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,010
That name should fill you with an Orwellian
terror.

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,830
That's what the Communist Party is calling
their new rating system.

58
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,209
It's like Yelp,

59
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,180
only instead of evaluating restaurants,

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,160
it evaluates people.

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,230
Every single one of China's 1.3 billion citizens,
that is.

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,569
By 2020,

63
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,760
this national government database will judge
you on things like

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,010
your credit,

65
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,780
whether or not you have a criminal record,

66
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,599
what kind of things you buy online,

67
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,879
what books you read,

68
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,690
your social media behavior.

69
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,870
Oh and of course, the ratings of your friends
and family.

70
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,690
So what happens if your social credit is bad?

71
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,129
Well, people are going to see that when you
apply for a job,

72
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,060
or housing, or a loan.

73
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,220
You don’t want to have a questionable person
working for you, do you?

74
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,599
One who might bring down your own credit rating?

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,500
Anyway, this new Social Credit System is sure
to be doubleplusgood.

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,800
Number 7

77
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,360
Meeting Your Doppelgänger

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,940
In November, the Chinese president met...

79
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,650
the other Chinese president.

80
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,950
And one of those presidents

81
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,990
people actually voted for.

82
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,840
In yet another linguistically confusing chapter
of the One China policy—

83
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,700
a policy that says Taiwan is a part of China,

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,370
but doesn't specify which government is the
legitimate government—

85
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,379
the unelected Chinese president Xi Jinping

86
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,039
met the democratically elected Chinese president
Ma Ying-jeou.

87
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,780
It's the first time the two sides met

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,600
since the end of the Chinese Civil War in
1949.

89
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,360
Number 6

90
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,049
The Year of Hacking

91
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,869
You really, really ought to update your computer's
software.

92
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:21,440
Because the failure of the US government's
Office of Personnel Management

93
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,849
to do just that opened the door to a massive
cyber attack from...

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,520
some foreign entity.

95
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,879
The hackers stole the personal data of 4.2
million

96
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,699
current and former federal employees.

97
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,759
And then we learned the number was actually
22 million.

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,069
Yes, one in every 15 Americans is now in this
hacker's database.

99
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,569
Information that, in the wrong hands...

100
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,069
well, let's just say this is not good.

101
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,050
So who was behind the attacks?

102
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,199
Well, we don't know for sure, but…

103
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,589
"What countries are attacking the United States
as we sit here in cyberspace?"

104
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,689
"Well, I don't want to give you a complete
list.

105
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,189
But I can tell you the top of the list is
the Chinese."

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,719
Number 5

107
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,919
(Cough cough cough cough)

108
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,039
There's no better way to ring in the New Year

109
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,169
than with a red alert warning that your nation's
capital

110
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,409
has air too hazardous to breathe.

111
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:19,249
This is what Beijing looked like at the beginning
of December.

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,919
Man, those aunties won't stop dancing for
anything!

113
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,529
This was the first official red alert from
Beijing's new warning system.

114
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,610
And in November, in another city, pollution
was even worse.

115
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,550
On a pollution scale of 1 to 500,

116
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,599
500 being really, really hazardous,

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,820
the city of Shenyang reached 1,400.

118
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,140
Pollution is so thick,

119
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,770
Chinese people can't even see the pollution
documentary "Under the Dome,"

120
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,839
by former CCTV reporter Cha Jing.

121
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,789
Just kidding.

122
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,469
It's because the Chinese government censored
it.

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,259
Number 4

124
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,020
Stock Market Crash

125
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,449
China's stock market skyrocketed early this
year.

126
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,599
And then in June, it crashed.

127
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,729
In China, most stock buyers are individual
people—

128
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,629
workers, retirees, etc.—

129
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,210
and a lot of them were first-time investors
who put money in the market

130
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,039
because state-run media told them too.

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,779
And a lot of them even borrowed money to buy
stocks—

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,060
something called "margin trading"—

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,640
because state-run media told them to.

134
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,110
When the markets crashed,

135
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,449
they couldn't pay back what they borrowed.

136
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,259
Which is why,

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,219
to help solve the financial crisis,

138
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:34,999
the government recommended people borrow more
money to buy stocks.

139
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,979
This hasn't worked very well so far.

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Number 3

141
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,499
The Tianjin Chemical Explosion

142
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,580
On August 12,

143
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,180
a pair of chemical explosions rocked the northern
Chinese city of Tianjin.

144
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,050
The cause is still unknown—

145
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,919
and by unknown,

146
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,699
I mean we only know what Chinese state-run
media told us:

147
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,460
It involved a warehouse storing toxic chemicals.

148
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:07,129
And they didn't even tell us that right away.

149
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,409
In fact initially, there was a total media
blackout.

150
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,619
Censors deleted thousands of posts about the
blasts on social media.

151
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,800
According to official statistics,

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,550
800 people were injured and almost 200
died.

153
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,439
Number 2

154
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,379
Now you can have a brother or sister!

155
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,229
At the end of October,

156
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,709
China finally repealed the One Child Policy.

157
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:32,580
The policy had led to mass infanticide and
forced abortion.

158
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,499
Oh, and it failed in its most basic goal:

159
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,149
to balance China's population.

160
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,520
After 30 years,

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,409
China now has too many old people

162
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,369
that can't be supported by the younger generation.

163
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,330
But now that the One Child Policy has been
repealed,

164
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,379
things are way better,

165
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,879
because you can have two kids instead of one!

166
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,969
Granted, there'll still be the same

167
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,639
overbearing government presence in people's
lives—

168
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,439
like work units monitoring female workers'
menstrual cycles—

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,320
and the fines and forced abortions will also
continue—

170
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,810
but now you can have up to two kids.

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,120
And finally, Number 1

172
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,379
Zhou Yongkang sentenced to life

173
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,249
Years ago I said Chinese leader Xi Jinping

174
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,300
would take out his political rival Zhou Yongkang.

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,280
It would be unprecedented.

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,459
Zhou was a member of the Politburo Standing
Committee.

177
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,959
You don't get much higher than that in the
Communist Party.

178
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,039
"And that the next step could be Zhou Yongkang

179
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,239
facing a fate similar to Bo (Xilai)."

180
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:31,459
The fools!

181
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,520
They laughed at me!

182
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,720
But who's laughing now?!

183
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,550
Ahh.

184
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,339
You see, Zhou Yongkang held a lot of power.

185
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,319
He was the head of China's internal security
network for years,

186
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,160
which meant he controlled a police force

187
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,860
with a budget larger than even the Chinese
army.

188
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,250
And he amassed that power primarily through
helping former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin

189
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,510
run his brutal campaign to suppress Falun
Gong.

190
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,200
What's the point of a massive security apparatus

191
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,490
if you can't torture some religious dissidents,
am I right?

192
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,069
Zhou was the biggest "tiger" to be hit

193
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,549
in Xi Jinping's "anti-corruption" campaign.

194
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,720
In June 2015, he got sentenced to life in
prison.

195
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,610
Again, he was one of the 9 most powerful men
in China.

196
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,890
Will we see something similar happen to Jiang
Zemin next year?

197
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,110
Let's just say I don't think Xi Jinping will
"let old acquaintance be forgot."

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
So what do you think will be in store for
China

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,290
and the rest of the world in 2016?

200
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,519

201
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,870
And thank you for making this the best year
for China Uncensored yet.

202
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,009
You're the best audience on YouTube.

203
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,049
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. Happy New
Year.

204
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,260
Merry Christmas.

205
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,720
And a very merry Christmas to the factory
workers in Yiwu,

206
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,209
a town in eastern China's Zhejiang province.

207
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,569
Because they've been working on Christmas
since January.

208
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,839
The fear is this new gene will get passed
around

209
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,290
along with other antibiotic resistant genes.

210
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,620
That could eventually create a pan-drug resistant
bacteria.

211
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,160
In other words, a bacteria that can't be killed
by anything we throw at it.
