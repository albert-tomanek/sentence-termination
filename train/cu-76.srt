bjbj,(,( China is a Twit About Twitter Hi,
welcome to China Uncensored, I m Chris Chappell.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,470
You know there s a funny habit oppressive
regimes always seem to share, they tend to

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,670
indulge in the same things they forbid the
people from having. And sometimes, it backfires.

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,230
Especially when it has to do with computers.
Because computers are hard. That s what someone

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,670
at China s state-run Xinhua news agency found
out when he tried to post a Tweet. You see

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,270
China has some pretty strict Internet censorship.
That s why you can t get on facebook in China.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,420
You might see something subversive. But you
re also not allowed to get on Twitter. Which

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,480
might make you think why the state-run Xinhua
news agency even has a Twitter account to

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,929
begin with. But then really, who told you
to think? So here s a tweet by a twit at Xinhua.

10
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,960
He s answering a question asking why the account
hasn t been active. And WHOEVER ASKED THAT

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,210
QUESTION BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN IN CHINA! Basically
the old account manager quit and didn t tell

12
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,500
anyone how to get around the Internet blockade.
That was the first post since 2011. But that

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,900
hasn t stopped Xinhua from setting up a fully
functional English language twitter account.

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,320
So if they only have a functioning English
account, and you aren t allowed to go on Twitter

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,120
in China, who are they really talking to?
Over the past few years, China has pumped

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,250
billions of dollars into foreign language
media campaigns. For example, A 40 BY 60 FOOT

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:41,430
LED 24 hours a day 7 DAY A WEEK 365 DAY A
YEAR AD FOR XINHUA IN THE CENTER OF NEW YORKs

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,270
TIMES SQUARE. And so while the rest of the
world is talking about China s rampant corruption,

19
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,360
political infighting, and atrocious human
rights record, if you go to the official source

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,310
for China news, you get stories like this
about Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He also has

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,710
dreamy eyes. So if you want real Chinese news
in 160 characters or less, forget Xinhua,

22
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,719
check out my twitter account. Or if you still
want fake China news, just go to the Relevant

23
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,209
Organs. They re fake China news is way better
than Xinhua s fake China news. Thanks for

24
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,849
watching this episode of China Uncensored.
Once again I m Chris Chappell, see you next

25
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,849
time. Dreamy eyes Chinese hasn t been working
since 2011, but the English Xinhua twitter

26
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:22,849
is fully operational. The push for soft power
In this Chinese language Xinhua Tweet, this

27
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,849
message a response to a question asking why
the account has not been active says, quote,

28
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:24,849
it can t be helped, the previous account manager
didn t tell us how to scale the wall before

29
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:25,849
he left, I am new here. JUST SO LONG AS YOU
