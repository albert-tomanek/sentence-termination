1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
China and Iran are buddying up

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,760
The Biden Administration is left hanging

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
and there’s more at stake than you may think

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,320
Before we begin, the reason this show is possible\h
is thanks to the support from viewers like you.\h\h

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,600
YouTube would have run us out of business with\h
all the demonetization and shadow banning.\h\h

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,760
So for as little as a dollar per episode\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon,\h\h

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,480
you can help us continue to uncensor China.\h

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
The Chinese Communist Party is actively\h
making the world a more dangerous place.\h\h

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
One of the ways is by dethroning\h
the US as the global superpower.\h\h

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,240
And to do that, the Communist Party supports\h
authoritarian regimes around the world.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,280
The latest example:\h\h

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,200
Iran. China just signed a 25 year deal with\h
Iran worth potentially 400 billion dollars.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,320
That money will go into a variety of Iranian\h
projects. The usual Belt and Road stuff. Ports,\h\h

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
oil, gas. Oh, and did I mention nuclear power?

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,840
Wasn’t there something about Iran and\h
nuclear power the world was concerned with?

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
“U.S. intelligence agencies\h
have long suspected Iran\h\h

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,240
of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover\h
for clandestine weapons development”—basically,\h\h

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,720
they’re trying to make nuclear weapons.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,000
And the fun doesn’t stop at nuclear\h
technology. Iran and China “will also\h\h

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,920
deepen their defense cooperation as China\h
will transfer some military technology.”

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
Fantastic.\h

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
Israel is particularly concerned about that.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
So what does China get out of this?\h
Global power and influence. Oh, and oil.\h

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,480
Iran is an international pariah. It\h
has a horrible human rights track\h\h

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,280
record. That’s why Iran and China can\h
be friends--they have so much in common.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
The US ranks Iran as one of the top\h\h

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,280
state sponsors of terrorism. Not to\h
mention its aggressive nuclear program.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,800
That’s why the Trump Administration\h
put sanctions on Iran.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
Now the Biden administration is hoping\h
to use those sanctions as leverage\h\h

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
to get Iran to back off from its nuclear program.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,200
But the new Iran-China deal gives Iran a\h
lot of power. It doesn’t have to come back\h\h

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,160
to the negotiating table with the US, if\h
it can increase trade with China instead.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,160
In fact, already the China-Iran deal\h\h

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,560
has forced the Biden Administration to go a little\h
softer on Iran. Soon after that deal was penned,\h\h

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Biden came to Iran with a new proposal\h
that included more sanctions relief.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,520
Iran desperately needs sanctions relief to prop\h
up its economy. But now it’s also looking at\h\h

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,360
selling more stuff to China instead of to Europe\h
or other countries that would follow US sanctions.

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,480
China imports about 70% of its oil. And\h
now, more of that oil will come from Iran.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,120
“In exchange [for the deal],\h
China would receive a regular and\h\h

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
heavily discounted supply of Iranian oil.”

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
“The deal helps Iran dodge American\h
sanctions, and the cash infusion\h\h

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
will ease economic pressure\h
on the ruling mullahs.”

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
So more money for the Iranian regime, and for\h
Iranian backed terrorist groups like Hezbollah.\h

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,920
There’s another part of the deal\h
that potentially weakens the US.\h\h

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,160
China and Iran want to create a joint bank. It’s\h
unclear how, or even if, this bank would work.

47
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,000
But it’s part of a bigger push by China,\h\h

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Iran, and Russia to break the US dollar’s\h
hold on global trade and finance.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,880
Nearly all of the 71 countries that are\h
part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative\h\h

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,920
have deals with China that involve US dollars.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,520
And the power of the US dollar is precisely why\h
US sanctions work to rein in regimes like Iran and\h\h

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,760
North Korea, as well as specific Chinese officials\h
who have been crushing democracy in Hong Kong.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,800
So far all those reasons, China and Iran teaming\h
up is not good for the US and the free world.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,680
And there’s an even bigger problem. America’s\h
enemies are working together up to undermine\h\h

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,200
what Biden calls the “rules\h
based” international order.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,160
As the Wall Street Journal says,\h
“Think Iran and Russia in Syria;\h\h

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
or China and Russia evading United\h
Nations sanctions to aid North Korea;\h\h

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,160
or China and Russia working through\h
Cuba to prop up Venezuela’s regime.”

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
Of course the deal is\h
controversial even inside Iran.\h\h

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,800
After all, China doesn’t have a great\h
reputation when it comes to these kinds of\h\h

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,920
bilateral deals. They often end up with the\h
other party getting stuck in a debt trap.\h

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
Very little about the deal has been made\h
public. And there’s a push for more details.

63
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,040
But an Iranian spokesperson said they\h
have no legal obligation to publish it.\h\h

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
The agreement was “not an\h
international treaty, or agreement,\h\h

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
and does not require parliamentary approval\h
under this legal interpretation,” he said.

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
Ah secret deals. Always a plus\h
when you’re a dictator. By the way,\h\h

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,600
that Iranian spokesperson also, “hinted that\h
China was standing in the way of publication”

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,640
Which is always reassuring when the Chinese\h
regime doesn’t want you to know what’s in a deal.

69
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,560
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
fans who support the show on Patreon.

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Logan asks, “I’ve been listening to a\h
podcast with a lot of Korean War history.\h\h

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,120
When China invades Taiwan, do you think\h
Xi, like Mao, will be able/willing\h\h

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
to throw his troops into the\h
meat grinder like that conflict?”

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,640
Great question. So one of the reasons the Chinese\h
Communist Party is trying to undermine the United\h\h

75
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,400
States with things like this Iran Deal, is\h
so when the Chinese regime invades Taiwan,\h\h

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,360
the US will have less power to\h
stop it—like by sanctioning China.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
And if the Communist Party successfully\h
conquers Taiwan, China becomes a superpower.\h\h

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,080
The world as we know it will change forever. And\h
everyone knows that, including the US and Taiwan.\h\h

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,240
So they’ll probably put up a\h
good fight. At least I hope so.

80
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,880
Unfortunately, the CCP will be more than\h
willing to sacrifice as many Chinese soldiers\h\h

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,320
as it needs to. It might not quite be like\h
the human wave attacks in the Korean War,\h\h

82
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,840
but in the Communist Party’s view,\h
Chinese soldiers are expendable.

83
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,720
Unlike in America, where the wholesale\h
slaughter of your troops could hurt your\h\h

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,480
chances of reelection. But that’s the advantage to\h
being an authoritarian leader of a country where\h\h

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,120
you control the media. The public doesn’t have to\h
be bothered with reports of casualties. In fact,\h\h

86
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
a war could be pretty good for getting\h
the public to ignore any internal problems\h\h

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
and focus on coming together to defeat the enemy.

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
Thanks for your question Logan.\h
