1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,820
Air pollution can be deadly.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,839
It kills more than a million people every
year in China.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,269
And officials can’t cover it up,

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,860
even though they might try.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,640
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,220
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,820
In a lot of places in the world,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,300
air pollution has reached dangerously high
levels.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,180
According to the World Health Organization,

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,480
91% of the world’s population is exposed

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,050
to levels of air pollution that are harmful.

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,230
Good thing I live in New York City,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,710
where we actually don’t have much air pollution.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,750
Of course, we have water pollution.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,760
And noise pollution.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,320
And rat pollution.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,230
But the air here is pretty good.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,370
But in China, there are a lot of cities

19
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,370
where the air quality is so bad,

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,750
it’s deadly.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,050
In fact, air pollution claims an estimated

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,399
1.8 million lives in China each year.

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,559
According to the most recent data from AirVisual,

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,780
a crowdsourced air quality insight platform,

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,210
China has the worst air in East Asia.

26
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,210
China has 53 major cities where the average
air quality

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,229
is considered “Unhealthy” by WHO guidelines,

28
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,359
that is, where the Air Quality Index is above
150.

29
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,920
But not every city can be a winner.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
So on this episode,

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,750
we’ll take a look only at the top 10

32
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,530
most air polluted cities in China.

33
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,530
Number 10

34
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,530
Wujiaqu.

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,529
Wujiaqu is a tiny city of just 100,000 people

36
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,140
in the northern part of Xinjiang.

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,319
That’s China’s western region that’s
home

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,460
mainly to a Turkic ethnic minority known as
the Uighurs.

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,179
It’s also home to some of that delightful
soviet-style architecture.

40
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:52,390
It’s *also* home to some pretty bad air
pollution:

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,740
157 on the Air Quality Index, which the WHO
dubs “Unhealthy.”

42
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,389
But during the winter months,

43
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,189
it can be as high as 250,

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,909
which is a lot more unhealthy.

45
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,209
Wujiaqu also happens to be less than 100 miles

46
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,659
from the least fun place in Xinjiang,

47
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:14,010
this reeducation camp in Dabancheng.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,069
In concentration camps like this across Xinjiang,

49
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,000
more than 1 million Uighurs are being detained

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,180
by the Chinese Communist Party.

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,909
So on the plus side,

52
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:28,170
air quality is not their number one concern.

53
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,170
Number 9

54
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,170
Linfen

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,690
Linfen is in China's Shanxi province.

56
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,819
Today, Linfen is only a moderately polluted
city.

57
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,810
But a decade ago it was known as the world's
most polluted city.

58
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,500
With an average 2018 air quality index of
158,

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,260
residents now report being able to see the
sun...sometimes.

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,870
What makes the air in Linfen so bad?

61
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,269
They love coal.

62
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,790
They love to truck it,

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,379
they love to shovel it,

64
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,409
and they love to burn it.

65
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,180
Just nobody really likes to breathe it.

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,709
Number 8

67
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,129
Baoding

68
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,610
Baoding is in China's Hebei province.

69
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,180
With a population of around 11 million,

70
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,430
it’s a...medium sized city for China.

71
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,849
Its Air Quality index comes in at 159.

72
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,490
China is the biggest energy consumer in the
world,

73
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,459
and its main source of electricity is coal.

74
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,030
Burn too much of that, though,

75
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,459
and the air turns black as soot.

76
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,620
Makes for nice sunsets, though.

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Number 7

78
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Anyang

79
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,249
Anyang is a city of around 5 million in Henan
province.

80
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,920
It made headlines in February when it won

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,400
China’s unofficial contest for most polluted
city of the month.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,579
Congratulations!

83
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,069
At one point during the month,

84
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,860
the air quality index in Anyang reached more
than 500.

85
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,420
How much more?

86
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,659
We don’t know,

87
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,840
because the indexing stops at 500.

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,200
It was literally off the charts.

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,510
Besides astronomical air pollution,

90
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,160
Anyang's other claim to fame is ancient archeological
digs.

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,200
It’s the burial place of the legendary Chinese
general Cao Cao—

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,780
whom you might know of from the book Romance
of the Three Kingdoms.

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,990
No?

94
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,360
OK, how about from the game Total War: Three
Kingdoms?

95
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,080
That’s what I thought.

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,420
Number 6

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,610
Handan

98
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,640
Located in China's northern Hebei province,

99
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,450
Handan is known as the birthplace of Yang-style
Tai Chi.

100
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,070
Though with an air quality index of 161,

101
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,590
you might want to put a mask on before you
go out to practice.

102
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,290
On some days, the smog is so bad it swallows
buildings.

103
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,110
One “solution” they've come up with is
this giant cannon.

104
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,510
It was designed to blast out a mist of water

105
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,730
to fight smog and clean the air.

106
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,120
Didn’t do much for smog, but it sure looks
fun.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Number 5

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Aksu

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,280
Aksu doesn’t sound like a very Chinese name...

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,640
because it’s not.

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,721
It’s another Uighur city

112
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,940
in China’s Xinjiang Totally Not Autonomous
region.

113
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,140
With an average 2018 air quality of 161,

114
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,200
Aksu is no place to breathe deep.

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,720
It’s also no place to get a whiff of freedom.

116
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,500
In Aksu, the authorities are forcing local
Uighur people

117
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,390
to register any tools that could potentially
be used as weapons,

118
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,560
like kitchen knives.

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,270
It’s so that the owner can be traced in
the event of a crime.

120
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
Unless the crime is committed

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,520
by a member of China’s military police—

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,810
in which case it wasn’t a crime,

123
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,530
it was a security measure.

124
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,530
Number 4

125
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,750
Shijiazhuang

126
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,390
Shijiazhuang is the capital of Hebei province.

127
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,370
It’s about 160 miles southwest of Beijing.

128
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,770
It’s a busy industrial base,

129
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,810
especially for steel and chemical production.

130
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,470
Last year's figures put the Air Quality Index
there at 162.

131
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,860
Shijiazhuang made headlines five years ago

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,580
when a resident became the first person in
China

133
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,930
to sue the government over dangerously high
levels of smog.

134
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,770
Plaintiff Li Guixin sued the local government
for about $1,500.

135
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,400
It was to compensate for what he spent

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,380
to counter the effects of pollution,

137
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,580
including buying facemasks and an air purifier.

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,650
Li told the BBC,

139
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,910
"The reason that I'm proposing administrative
compensation

140
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,140
is to let every citizen see that amid this
haze,

141
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,740
we're the real victims."

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,310
Did he win his lawsuit against Chinese authorities?

143
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,400
I’ll let you guess.

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Number 3

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Xingtai

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,930
Xingtai is another city in Hebei province,

147
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,160
and also a major center for China's steel
industry.

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,450
And that's fuelled by smokey coal.

149
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,270
It’s currently in third place among Chinese
cities,

150
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,870
with an air quality level of 162.

151
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,770
A bronze medal ranking is nothing to sneeze
at,

152
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,350
but there was once a time Xingtai won gold

153
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,220
in the contest for China’s most polluted
city.

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,950
A study published in 2013 suggested that

155
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,790
“an arbitrary Chinese policy” had massively
increased air pollution,

156
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,840
causing “500 million residents of Northern
China

157
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,620
to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of
life expectancy."

158
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,320
That arbitrary policy is the Huai River Policy.

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,260
Since the 1950s, it’s provided subsidized
coal for indoor heating.

160
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,970
Yes, cheap coal for the masses!

161
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,460
Another well-thought-out central policy with
absolutely no downside.

162
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,460
Number 2

163
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,600
Kashgar

164
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,780
Kashgar is often considered the cultural heart
of Xinjiang.

165
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,520
But not the cultural lungs.

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,750
In 2018, Kashgar had air quality index of
172.

167
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,620
Back in 2016, Kashgar made headlines

168
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,000
for briefly achieving the top spot

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,500
on China's most polluted cities list.

170
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,320
Now it's making headlines as a place

171
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,870
where the Chinese Communist Party

172
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,630
has taken to closing and bulldozing mosques

173
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,660
in its fight against religion.

174
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,520
Nothing says “Allah is number one,”

175
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,000
like worshipping the atheist Chinese Communist
Party.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don’t worry,

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,840
a lot of the mosques in Kashgar are getting
torn down,

178
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,110
to make way for the things the locals really
want,

179
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,440
like shopping malls.

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,020
If you build it, they will come, right?

181
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,370
Maybe not.

182
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,580
And the Number 1 most air polluted city in
China:

183
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Hotan

184
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,730
Hotan is also a city in Xinjiang,

185
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,550
and it’s located within the giant Taklimakan
Desert.

186
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,150
Hotan’s average air quality index last year
was 182,

187
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,960
with a spike in April of 358.

188
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,070
But what makes Hotan’s air so bad

189
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,370
is not just regular air pollution caused by
heavy industry.

190
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,180
It’s also the frequent sandstorms.

191
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,770
As the storms kick up sand,

192
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,150
the air pollution readings can go up dramatically.

193
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,090
You know what else kicks up sand?

194
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,900
The construction of concentration camps

195
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,270
where the Chinese regime is locking up Uighurs.

196
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,210
Have I mentioned the concentration camps?

197
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,330
Look how happy everyone there is,

198
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,650
listening to speeches while being “protected”

199
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,810
by barbed wire fences and armed guards.

200
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,960
Honestly, sandstorms don’t seem that bad
by comparison.

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:19,810
Now if the air pollution in China seems pretty
bad...well, it is.

202
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,050
Although according to official data,

203
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,160
China is not as bad as India,

204
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,730
which seems to have out-polluted China in
recent years.

205
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,300
But that’s the problem:

206
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,900
China’s official data.

207
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,040
Even state-run media has had to admit that

208
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,290
a lot of the environmental data is being faked,

209
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,780
as local officials try to make their cities
look better.

210
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,170
This is not a one-off thing.

211
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,170
As of last year,

212
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,630
“more than 1,000 officials have been punished

213
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,880
for failing to fulfill their environmental
protection duties”

214
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,660
after a “nationwide comprehensive environmental
inspection.”

215
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,460
For example, in Linfen,

216
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,360
the Chinese city ranked number nine,

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
“former bureau chief Zhang Wenqing and 11
others

218
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,610
were found to have altered air quality monitoring
data

219
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,690
during days of heavy pollution.

220
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,250
The monitoring machine was blocked

221
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,130
and sprayed with water to improve the data

222
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,580
and Zhang was also found to have paid another
person

223
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,130
to make sure the sabotage was not captured
by surveillance camera.”

224
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,830
Seriously?

225
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,180
There are some things you just can’t cover
up.

226
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,400
Specifically, the things that cover everything
else up.

227
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,980
So what do you think about China's air pollution?
