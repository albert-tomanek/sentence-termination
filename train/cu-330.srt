1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,340
who would have thought a one-party state

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,680
wouldn’t approve of democracy?!

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,200
Hi, and welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,009
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:14,509
You know,

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,529
a lot of people have said

8
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,049
that China just isn’t ready for democracy.

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,580
There’s too many people

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,430
who aren’t educated enough,

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,380
and as former Chinese minister

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,180
of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing said,

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,040
“transportation is not developed in some
places,

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,040
so direct election will be difficult.”

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,340
Yes,

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,469
bad roads are the reason

17
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,570
China doesn’t have democracy.

18
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,829
Doesn’t stop New York, though.

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,140
But back to Chinese democracy!

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,440
Highly anticipated for years,

21
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,519
promised but pushed back multiple times,

22
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,730
and then ultimately banned in China

23
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,079
for being too controversial.

24
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,460
Wait,

25
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,940
that's the well-intentioned but ultimately
mediocre

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,809
Guns N’ Roses album.

27
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,239
Never thought that Axl Rose

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,390
would be one of the most woke celebrities

29
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,120
on China.

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,360
But for real Chinese democracy,

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,670
look no further than Wukan Village

32
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,479
in China’s Southern Guangdong Province.

33
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,570
In 2011,

34
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,820
the entire village erupted into protests.

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,140
Their local communist officials

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,869
were taking villagers’ land

37
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,250
and selling it to real estate developers

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,990
for huge profits.

39
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,219
Something that's happened in countless villages

40
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,419
across China for years.

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,140
But in Wukan,

42
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,060
villagers put up barricades

43
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,579
and kicked out the officials.

44
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,719
But instead of villagers getting Tiananmen
Square’d,

45
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,359
this guy stepped in:

46
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,359
Wang Yang,

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,920
the Party Secretary for Guangdong Province.

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,020
Surprisingly,

49
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,729
instead of brutally crushing the protesters,

50
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,409
he let the Wukan villagers

51
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,229
vote for new officials.

52
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,000
And they elected this guy,

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
Lin Zuluan,

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,340
one of the protest leaders.

55
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,420
This was an unprecedented moment

56
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,840
in modern Chinese history,

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,829
where the Communist Party backed down

58
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,220
in the face of protests,

59
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,600
and allowed for real democratic elections.

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
Media began referring to it

61
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,680
as the Wukan model.

62
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,030
Some people thought that soon

63
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,369
this kind of local-level democracy

64
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,760
could be implemented everywhere across China.

65
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,780
So let’s look in and see how it’s doing
five years later.

66
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,800
Oh, well that didn’t last long, did it?

67
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,330
Yes,

68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,739
apparently the Wukan model is to briefly allow
democracy,

69
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,930
and then crush it.

70
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,770
“Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!”

71
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,400
And you know what?

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Even during the period when democracy worked
in Wukan,

73
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
it didn’t really work.

74
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,750
After villagers elected Lin Zuluan to represent
them,

75
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,120
he found himself immediately blocked from
doing,

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,620
well,

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
anything -

78
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,300
by officials the next level up.

79
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,620
So five years later,

80
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,629
much of the land taken from villagers

81
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,290
has still not been returned.

82
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,600
Frustrated by this,

83
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,870
three months ago Lin Zuluan had threatened

84
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,030
to bring his people back out on to the streets.

85
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,030
Unbelievable!

86
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,540
How dare he ask for the thing

87
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,440
that he was promised five years ago?

88
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,980
Arrest this man!

89
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,709
Ha ha, just kidding.

90
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,300
What’s that Shelley?

91
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh.

92
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,690
They did arrest him.

93
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,610
Not for threatening to hold public protests,
mind you.

94
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,760
But for taking tens of thousands of dollars

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,239
in bribes and kickbacks.

96
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,939
And if you think those are just trumped-up
charges,

97
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,879
you couldn’t be more wrong.

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,159
While being detained by authorities,

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,610
Lin admitted to the charges!

100
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,610
And by admitted,

101
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,500
I mean confessed on state-run CCTV.

102
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,799
So you know it’s legit.

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
Good thing they suddenly discovered his bribes
and kickbacks

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,140
right before he was about to mobilize those
pesky protesters!

105
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
And last week,

106
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,920
they formally sentenced Lin Zuluan

107
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,659
to three years in prison.

108
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,700
That makes Lin now the third democratically
elected village official

109
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,549
involved with the 2011 Wukan protests

110
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,780
to be imprisoned by authorities.

111
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,250
Two others were jailed in 2014.

112
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,360
And there you have it:

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,210
Proof that democracy is a terrible idea,

114
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,210
because clearly

115
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,920
the uninformed citizens only elect criminals.

116
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,090
But for some reason,

117
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,180
Wukan villagers seem to suspect

118
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,720
something fishy is going on.

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,299
After Lin Zuluan was arrested in June,

120
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,210
they started protesting his detention.

121
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,220
Oddly enough,

122
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,180
while waving the flag and shouting

123
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,350
“long live the Communist Party.”

124
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,550
I know it looks like there’s some kind of
disconnect here.

125
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,030
But actually, it's pretty smart, in a way.

126
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,990
Can the Communist Party really accuse you
of subverting state power

127
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,650
when you're cheering for them?

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,380
What are they going to do,

129
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,749
crack down on these people?

130
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,840
Back to that in a moment.

131
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,650
We have so much footage of the protests in
Wukan

132
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,080
partly because Western media have been reporting
from there.

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,580
And authorities have been trying to drive
the reporters out.

134
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,540
Back in June,

135
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,320
one BBC reporter expressed his concern that

136
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,090
if he were to leave,

137
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,250
riot police might be sent in.

138
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,020
But that’s silly, as one local official
assured him.

139
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,940
It's only that reporter's fantasy!

140
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,730
The reporter eventually left for a while.

141
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,819
And guess what?

142
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,610
His fantasy came true!

143
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,120
The riot police were sent in to restore social
harmony,

144
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,920
bearing peace offerings of tear gas and rubber
bullets.

145
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,419
So now it’s time to ask the most important
question of all:

146
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,500
Who’s fault is it?

147
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,759
Fortunately, my favorite state-run media,

148
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,759
Global Times,

149
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,669
has done a thorough investigation.

150
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,539
According to this editorial,

151
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,889
“some foreign media have been unscrupulously
inciting,

152
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,009
planning, and directing chaos.”

153
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,440
Yes,

154
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,880
“foreign media” are to blame!

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,410
Those unscrupulous Western reporters have
been stirring up trouble

156
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,510
just so they can camp out for weeks

157
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,050
in some podunk village in the backwaters of
China

158
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,440
and promote their agenda of so-called “human
rights”

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,050
to undermine the Communist Party!

160
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,130
But you know what really undermines the Communist
Party?

161
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,130
Democracy.

162
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,680
Free elections.

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,230
Because if people are allowed to elect their
own representatives,

164
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,080
and those representatives are actually permitted
to do their jobs,

165
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,310
then how can the Communist Party control things?

166
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,310
The truth is,

167
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,330
while the Communist Party is in power,

168
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,620
it’s never going to give up control.

169
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,849
In fact,

170
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,889
the “leadership of the Communist Party”

171
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,419
is literally written into the Chinese constitution.

172
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,599
So yeah,

173
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,940
that’s not going away.

174
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,350
And anyone who tries to change the status
quo

175
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,039
can be in trouble.

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,440
Remember Wang Yang?

177
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,289
The Party Secretary of Guangdong Province
five years ago?

178
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,289
Well,

179
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,000
he was the one who arranged for Wukan to have
those elections

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,540
in the first place.

181
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,702
And at the time, it seemed like a clever way

182
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,680
of avoiding unrest while making the Party
look good.

183
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,230
But a lot of his political opponents,

184
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,800
including people in the decrepit-toad-with-glasses
faction,

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,650
were upset that Wang allowed this democratic
experiment to happen.

186
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,850
Some analysts say that now,

187
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,759
Wang Yang’s political rivals are actually
the ones

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,700
behind the events that led up to the new Wukan
protests this year.

189
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,150
Because the chaos shows that Wang’s experiment
failed.

190
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,170
And making Wang look bad is part of a political
strategy,

191
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,930
because word on the street is that

192
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,340
Wang’s homie-in-chief, Xi Jinping,

193
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,260
may be looking to place Wang in a new position,

194
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,600
where he would replace one of these political
rivals.

195
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,030
That would be harder to do if Wang is discredited.

196
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,470
And Jiang Zemin's faction really needs a win
right now,

197
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,419
because one of their own just got purged.

198
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,419
Oh sorry,

199
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,800
I mean “placed under investigation for corruption.”

200
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,599
Basically, it’s China’s Game of Thrones.

201
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:53,690
So what do you think?

202
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,129

Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

207
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,300
See you next time!
