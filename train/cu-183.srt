the US How A Transition of Power is Done!

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,090
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I m Chris
Chappell. You know, once again, China has

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,330
shown the US just how backwards it is. The
US Presidential elections are tomorrow and

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,291
the 18th Party Congress is Thursday, that
s when China has a once in a decade transition

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:26,610
of power. And you know, they just got it down.
They know how to keep things harmonious during

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,800
politically sensitive dates. I mean, just
today, I got in a cab, rolled the windows

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,550
down, went to the store and bought a ping-pong
ball. And it's the day before the election!

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,300
I mean, think of the damage you can do with
a ping-pong ball. Not to mention a taxicab

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,520
window you can roll down. That s why in Beijing,
you can t do stuff like that. They ve had

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
all the taxicabs rip out their window handles
and they ve banned the sale of ping-pong balls.

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,161
I mean, what if someone were to write reactionary
words on it and threw it out of a taxi. It

12
00:00:55,161 --> 00:01:00,190
could go anywhere! Anyone could read it and
think who knows what kind of thoughts! But

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,350
the Chinese regime isn t stopping there. Officials
doing everything they can to ensure that they

14
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,650
aren t going to be bothered while they re
having their meeting. Want to buy a knife?

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,100
Too bad. A pencil sharpener? Who the hell
do you think you are? A remote controlled

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,250
air plane? Come on, really? And for all you
homing pigeon fans out there, don t think

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,200
they ve forgotten about you. No pigeons! Meanwhile
in the US, people are walking around with

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,280
sharp pencils in their pockets that could
write anything on anything. There are all

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,840
kinds of unsavory characters (like me) who
might be planning to release the 35 homing

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,430
pigeons they ve been training for the past
six months to carry Vote Herman Cain messages

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,330
strapped to their leg. I think its time we
all pack our bags and moved to China, cause

22
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,920
we re probably not going to have a country
by the end of the week if we just allow these

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,640
kind of shenanigans. Rapscallions with ping-pong
balls! Is that what George Washington killed

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,799
all those British people for? Think about
it America. Once again I m Chris Chappell,
