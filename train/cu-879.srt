00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,059
Chinese police have a new plan to crack down
on illegal activity:

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,149
Rip people off their scooters,

3
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:10,269
and confiscate their vehicles.

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,010
What’s really behind it?

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:20,710
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,860
This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark—because
you should be protecting your identity whenever

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,150
you go online by using a VPN like Surfshark.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,410
The Chinese Communist Party seeks to create
a harmonious society.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:42,780
And for them, “harmonious” means highly
regulated, tightly controlled, and most importantly,

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,620
looking perfect on the surface.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,100
Which is why when Party officials see this,
it’s just not ok.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,329
Chaotic intersections?

13
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,940
We can’t have that.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,290
So should we install functioning traffic lights?

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,970
Assign police to direct traffic?

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,080
No!

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,990
The problem is all those poor people riding
scooters and motorbikes.

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,450
We can’t have this.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,829
Or this.

20
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,149
Arrest them!

21
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,409
Haha, no seriously.

22
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,909
Arrest them.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,869
Recently, officials in Dongguan city—which
is here, in Guangdong province—have tried

24
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,350
to harmonize the city streets...

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,850
...with a large-scale seizure of scooters
and motorcycles.\h

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:33,759
Yes, the Public Security Bureau ordered its
police to break into people’s homes and

27
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,679
snag their vehicles.\h

28
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,220
“Many motorcycles driving on the streets
or parked in front of residents’ homes were

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,779
seized by the police.

30
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:47,240
Delivery men came out of the door to find
out their vehicles have been towed away by

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,100
the police.”

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,920
In the past couple weeks, a surge of videos
showing Chinese police taking parked motorcycles

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,740
off the street began circulating on the internet.

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,329
They would even take the motorcycles right
off people’s property, without giving any

35
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,659
notice.

36
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,780
What if you’re already on your motorcycle?

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,349
Don’t worry!

38
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,530
Police can solve that problem for you.

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,190
I wonder why this guy is speeding away from
the police.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,269
He should really just pull over, and let the
police take his bike away.

41
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,000
What if you refuse to get off your scooter?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,159
Police can solve that problem, too.

43
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,799
There’s lots of policemen and only one of
you.

44
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,840
\h
And frankly, most people whose motorcycles

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,860
are being taken aren’t so lucky.

46
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,310
“You dare fight back?

47
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,310
You dare fight back?”

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,590
Yeah, how dare he fight back!

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,500
What, does he think he owns his own property?

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,350
This is communist China, comrade.

51
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,469
“This is not your motorcycle.

52
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,329
This is the Nation’s motorcycle!”

53
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,920
Your motorcycle belongs to the people!

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,079
And by the people, we mean us, the police.

55
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,099
Truly, this is for your own protection.

56
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,129
And it’s important your children understand
this, too.

57
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,079
Maybe you can just push your kids in a wheelbarrow
instead.

58
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:21,269
Unsurprisingly, this mass and arbitrary seizure
of motorcycles left some people feeling hopeless.

59
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,269
“Tragic.

60
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,980
Went to buy some stuff, and I lost a bike.”

61
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,879
And it’s left others furious.

62
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,879
“How come you law enforcement can have motorcycles?

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,879
Why don’t you walk?”

64
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,879
“Our motorcycles are stolen right from our
homes.

65
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,530
Tell me how can I live like this?

66
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,292
Tell me the reason for this.

67
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,292
I’m scared to go out because my motorcycle
will be taken.”

68
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:43,230
For a lot of people in China, their motorcycle
or scooter is their livelihood.

69
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,120
Like if you’re a delivery worker, and police
decide they want to take your scooter...and

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,379
also your cargo.

71
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:55,819
This delivery boy is threatening to commit
suicide because police are taking his scooter—and

72
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,980
without it he loses his way to make a living.

73
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,659
So what’s really driving Chinese authorities’
push to seize people’s scooters and motorcycles?

74
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,580
I’ll get to that after the break.

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,060
Welcome back.

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,909
At the end of March, the city of Dongguan
organized a police gathering, instructing

77
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,410
them to confiscate “illegal” scooters
and motorcycles from civilians.

78
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,610
Now, it’s true that some of these vehicles
are unregistered or aren’t compliant.

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,410
But if that were the real problem, there’d
be a much easier and less brutal way to solve

80
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,410
it.\h

81
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,200
Officially, this new policy—or you might
call it a “political campaign”—was triggered

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,780
after two traffic accidents involving motorcycles
in Dongguan killed three people.

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,840
Plus, “As of mid-March, there have been
15 motorcycle accidents and 17 deaths in the

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,470
city this year.

85
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:58,470
From 2018 to 2020, 814 people were killed
in traffic accidents involving motorcycles

86
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,820
and electric bicycles in Dongguan, accounting
for up to 48% of the total number of traffic

87
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
accidents.”

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,160
And in several other big cities in China,
motorcycles and/or scooters are also banned

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,610
or regulated for reasons I mentioned earlier.

90
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,220
Officials claim it’s in the interest of
public safety.

91
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,000
Because Chinese officials truly care about
the safety of the people.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Whether it’s pedestrians...

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,560
Street vendors...

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,950
and especially children.

95
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,740
They always think of the children.

96
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,750
But surprisingly, not everyone believes these
latest motorcycle seizures *are* really about

97
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,120
safety.

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,900
Some citizens suspect the policy is used to
“clean up” the streets by getting poor

99
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,740
people out of the public view.

100
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,730
When police confiscate the scooters and motorcycles,
they often say they don’t meet regulations,

101
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,800
or they’re unlicensed.

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,180
In Dongguan, “more than 90% of the local
motorcycles and electric vehicles have no

103
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,000
license plates.”

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,130
But when a reporter called the Dongguan city
government hotline to find documents with

105
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,220
rules for confiscating vehicles, the operator
said “It is not clear whether this operation

106
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,620
has any relevant documents to reveal.”

107
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,940
And the local police said, “Once the latest
legal regulations are confirmed, they will

108
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,990
be announced through official channels as
soon as possible.”

109
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,630
So, take people’s stuff first, and then
make the rules that give you permission to

110
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,200
have taken it.

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,350
Perfect.

112
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,110
So what happens to all the confiscated scooters
and motorcycles?

113
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,310
Some videos show motorcycles getting crushed
and recycled in junkyards.

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,650
But it seems there’s more to it.

115
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,330
This photo shows a ticket for 1,200 RMB—about
$180.

116
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,490
It was given to a citizen who requested their
motorcycle be returned.

117
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,120
So some people believe this whole confiscation
policy is just a way for local authorities

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,740
to make money.

119
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,870
They take your bike, and you have to pay them
to get it back.

120
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,340
It’s like the Mafia, only it’s the police.

121
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,210
There’s rows and rows of confiscated vehicles.

122
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,740
Looks like a cash cow to me.

123
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,930
And a sign of a truly harmonious society.\h

And in many cases, by the government.

129
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,910
And if you’re in an authoritarian country
like China this kind of tracking can put you

130
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,920
at risk of surveillance and even arrest.
