00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,300
a bribery trial of a Chinese national

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,740
shows that China’s Belt and Road deals

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,180
can be pretty shady.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,980
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,759
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,230
Dr. Patrick Ho: Former Hong Kong Secretary
for Home Affairs.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,240
With a smile fit for a king...

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,120
pin

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,820
He’s a big name in China.

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,019
Here he is with film star Jackie Chan

12
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,529
at some weird art show in 2004.

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,210
Supposedly, they’re holding their hands
up in a universal sign

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,260
of peace, love, and international understanding.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,240
Or, maybe they were planning on making a sequel

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,120
to my favorite kung fu flick,

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,660
Dirty Ho.

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,040
But Dr. Ho left Hong Kong politics in 2007.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,270
He eventually became a global pitchman for a

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,160
Chinese energy company that’s key to the

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,449
Chinese Communist Party’s Belt and Road
Initiative.

22
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,680
That is,

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,539
the Party’s scheme for global domination.

24
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,449
Dr. Ho got another chance to put his hands
in the air

25
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,410
last year in November,

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,440
when New York police arrested him on charges
of

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,530
bribing African government officials

28
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,570
through US financial institutions.

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,990
The 69-year-old dealmaker is accused of using a

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,210
US-based think tank with links to

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,910
the United Nations to funnel 2.9 million dollars

32
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,450
worth of bribes to senior officials in Africa.

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,310
They were billed as “donations.”

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,450
But if these “donations” were in fact
bribes

35
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,210
to foreign officials, they would

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,700
violate the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,

37
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,490
because his think tank is registered in the
US.

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,920
Around the time of his arrest,

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,740
acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon Kim said

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,390
“In an international corruption scheme

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,970
that spanned the globe...

42
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,650
Patrick Ho and Cheikh Gadio allegedly conspired

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,630
to bribe African government officials

44
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,920
on behalf of a Chinese energy conglomerate.”

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,910
Cheikh Gadio is the former foreign minister
of Senegal.

46
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,900
He’s was allegedly Dr. Ho’s co-conspirator.

47
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,120
I say “was”, because he’s made a deal
with prosecutors,

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,179
and is testifying against Dr. Ho in exchange for

49
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,690
getting the charges against himself dropped.

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,190
I mean, is there no honor among thieves anymore?

51
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,770
What’s the world coming to?

52
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,540
The Chinese Communist Party even has a new term

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,220
for betraying your partners out of self-interest.

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,400
They call it win-win mutual cooperation.

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,140
So Dr. Ho could end up in US prison

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,580
for up to 20 years if the jury finds him guilty.

57
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,170
He’s been held for the past year

58
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,230
without bail and his trial begins this week.

59
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,460
Prosecutors say Dr. Ho used a US-based think
tank

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,240
funded by CEFC China Energy,

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,430
and leveraged his connections at the UN

62
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,580
to funnel 2 million dollars to the president
of Chad.

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,270
Prosecutors also say he gave half a million
dollars

64
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,500
to the foreign minister of Uganda.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,760
Both of the, um “charitable contributions”,

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,680
were in exchange for “valuable oil rights”
for CEFC.

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,010
CEFC is a company from Shanghai,

68
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,760
led by a guy with ties to the People’s Liberation
Army

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,959
and Chinese military intelligence.

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,370
CEFC has invested about $20 billion in

71
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,410
Belt and Road Initiative projects, largely
to acquire oil.

72
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,000
The Belt and Road is China’s trillion-dollar
plan

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,830
to build trade corridors across the world.

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,200
So... a mysterious think tank

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,970
secretly has ties to military intelligence

76
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,190
and carries out operations around the world.

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,540
It sounds like Patrick Ho is just a

78
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,700
300-pound evil MacGyver.

79
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,230
But instead of using duct tape and a Swiss
Army Knife

80
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,890
to solve problems for the Phoenix Foundation,

81
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,840
MacGyver’s “think tank,”

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,200
Dr. Ho just used his think tank to

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,360
give the bad guys lots of money.

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
Allegedly.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,880
But regardless of whether the jury finds Dr.
Ho guilty,

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,520
this whole affair is reflecting really, really
badly

87
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,010
on China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

88
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,960
The Communist Party says the Belt and Road

89
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,740
is all about helping the developing world.

90
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,849
They’ve been using it to position China
as globalization’s BFF.

91
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,989
Dr. Ho has been one of its biggest promoters.

92
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,740
Since 2013, he’s hosted annual

93
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,680
“China Story” forums at the United Nations.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,640
Last year, he coined the concept of Belt and
Road

95
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,000
as “globalization 2.0,”

96
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,189
a buzzword quickly adopted by Chinese state-run
media

97
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,740
that went viral.

98
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,060
Globalization 1.0 was the colonization and
multi-nationalization

99
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,700
led by Western nations.

100
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,270
But version 2.0, led by the world’s biggest
authoritarian regime,

101
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,449
is definitely going to be much better.

102
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,699
Sadly, Dr. Ho’s trial threatens to expose
some of the

103
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,419
bugs in “globalization 2.0.”

104
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,370
And it comes at a time when the Trump administration

105
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,639
is already calling out China for bad behavior
in global commerce,

106
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,050
tightening scrutiny over Chinese investments,

107
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,569
and prosecuting economic espionage.

108
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,979
Robert Precht, a U.S. criminal law expert,

109
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,599
told the Wall Street Journal that

110
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,319
“One of the goals of the Patrick Ho prosecution

111
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,729
is to put a spotlight on China’s use of
foreign bribery

112
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,789
to win contracts for Belt and Road.”

113
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,079
And since Dr. Ho’s fall from grace,

114
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,469
the fortunes of CEFC Energy Company

115
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:19,169
—which funded his think tank—

116
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,219
have also taken a tumble.

117
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:22,270
Earlier this year,

118
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,460
Chinese authorities arrested the head of CEFC,

119
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,879
Ye Jianming,

120
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,110
wiping out 153 million dollars in stock value
in the process.

121
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,960
While no formal charges have been announced
for Mr. Ye,

122
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,939
he was named in a Chinese court case

123
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,439
last month as a bribe-giver

124
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,330
during the conviction of a provincial governor
for corruption.

125
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,370
And he’s got something to worry about,

126
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,400
because unlike in America, where a bribery
conviction

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,339
might land you in an orange jumpsuit for a
few decades,

128
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,580
in China,

129
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,809
Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign is
deadly business.

130
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,309
Just look at former deputy mayor of Lüliang,

131
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,339
who according to Chinese state-run media

132
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,220
“did not restrain himself” and

133
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,589
“crazily took bribes” to the tune of a
160 million dollars.

134
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,589
As punishment

135
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:11,320
they took away his black hair dye before
the trial.

136
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,060
And then executed him immediately.

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,020
So actually Dr. Ho should thank his lucky
stars

138
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,430
he’s facing trial in the US

139
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,129
where at worst, he’ll end up behind bars

140
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,909
and be forced to make some interesting new
friends.

141
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,880
So what do you think about Dr. Ho’s trial?

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
Leave your comments below.

143
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,479
And before you go,

144
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,949
it’s time for me to answer a question from
one of you

145
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,919
who supports China Uncensored through the
crowdfunding website Patreon.

146
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,800
Ted Canguy asks:

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,080
“Will hyperinflation happen in China

148
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,499
due to over-spending in construction?

149
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:44,900
Will China become like Venezuela

150
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,780
where people are starving and can't afford
food?”

151
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,699
Good question, Ted.

152
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,310
It’s possible hyperinflation could happen
in China,

153
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,770
but it’s not likely to happen just because
of

154
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,599
overspending in construction.

155
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,949
Hyperinflation is where prices rise so quickly,

156
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,340
that the cost of everyday items grows literally
every day.

157
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,080
In Venezuela, prices have risen so fast

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,939
that stores started weighing money

159
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,569
instead of wasting time counting it.

160
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,240
To simplify things a lot,

161
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,720
hyperinflation tends to happen when consumers
and businesses

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,339
massively lose confidence in the currency,

163
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,289
and then the government is forced to print
extra money

164
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,960
to cover expenses, which just causes more
inflation.

165
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,220
In China, however,

166
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,149
the government has massive foreign currency
reserves,

167
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,999
including 3 trillion worth of US dollars.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,580
Foreign reserves can help China stabilize
its currency.

169
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,300
Not to say that China doesn’t have economic
problems

170
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,640
—caused, for example,

171
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,460
by building too many bridges,

172
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,800
or too many apartments that average workers
can’t afford.

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Or problems resulting by US trade tariffs

174
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,820
that hurt Chinese manufacturing.

175
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,040
That being said,

176
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,300
China’s economic problems won’t necessarily

177
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,270
lead to hyperinflation.

178
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,349
It’s possible,

179
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,289
but not that likely.

180
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,860
The problems might just cause people

181
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,660
to lose confidence in the ruling regime.

182
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,520
Thanks for your question, Ted.

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
And for everyone else,

184
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,099
do you want me to keep making episodes of
China Uncensored?

185
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,719
Please support to our continued growth

186
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,129
by pledging a dollar or more per episode

187
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,479
by going to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

188
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,240
Or pledge two dollars per episode,

189
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,369
because you never know when inflation’s
going to kick in.

190
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,900
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

191
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
