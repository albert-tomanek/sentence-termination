1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,949
Nothing’s Racier Than Democracy

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:06,160
At least to the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,580
That's why they’ve taken to PornHub

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,340
To spread disinformation about Hong Kong.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,960
Welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,420
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,810
I’m sorry to say, the Chinese Communist
Party may have just won

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,950
the propaganda war against Hong Kong protesters.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,599
By using...PornHub.

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,050
Protests have rocked Hong Kong for 5 months.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,210
Protesters are fighting against the Chinese
Communist Party’s

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,670
efforts to take away Hong Kong freedoms.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,530
Wow, an underdog fight for liberty.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,370
A compelling story.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,250
Which is why the Chinese Communist Party

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,399
is trying to twist the narrative.

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,610
State-run media says the protesters are rioters,

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,570
and probably terrorists.

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,460
But not a lot of people read

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,140
the English version of Chinese state-run media.

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,670
They’re into a different type of pornography.

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,220
Since the protests began in June,

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,409
China used Twitter Porn Bots to spam disinformation

24
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,650
about the Hong Kong Protests.

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,439
Yes, because people who follow porn accounts
on Twitter

26
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,110
are the target market for disinformation.

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,909
Facebook and YouTube were also used in similar
ways.

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,470
But eventually, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,470
all took action

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,250
to stop the spread of this Chinese propaganda.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,780
So obviously, with no other option left,

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,720
the Chinese Communist Party turned...to PornHub.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,070
This Chinese social commentator with 3 million
followers

34
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,600
said she switched to posting on PornHub

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,759
after YouTube shut down their accounts.

36
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,229
Here’s a new channel on PornHub

37
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,049
called Chinese Communist Youth League Central.

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,960
Probably no official tie to the Communist
Youth League.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,590
They have over 9000 views and 32 subscribers.

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,159
I think you’re using PornHub wrong.

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,430
There are others.

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,470
Like this video called Rioters (Cockroach)
in Hong Kong.

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,810
It’s a very disturbing video of a man getting
into

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,550
an argument with protesters

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,240
before someone lights him on fire.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
The user said,

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,380
“Chinese people are at risk of being burned
alive

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,580
if they dare to disagree with the fascist
right-wingers in Hong Kong.”

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,240
Just the kind of content people are looking
for on PORNHUB!!!

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,710
So Chinese Communist Propaganda

51
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,380
can really turn up everywhere.

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,070
Have fun out there, kids.

53
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,970
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

54
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,320
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,340
see you next time.
