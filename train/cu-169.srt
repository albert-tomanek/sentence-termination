get your Vault-Tec Vaults today

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,450
and prepare for nuclear fallout!

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,460
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,179
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,329
You know, when I hear that confrontations

7
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,069
in disputed territorial waters

8
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:25,210
could potentially spark a world war,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,060
I think, hey,

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,759
we should put a nuclear power plant there.

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,679
Now I know, potential war zones,

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,350
or water,

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,710
is not the place you would normally think

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,239
is the ideal location for a nuclear power
plant.

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,079
But China begs to differ.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
In their 13th Five Year Plan—

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,809
that's what the Communist Party's calls a
series of social and economic initiatives—

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,540
they rolled out this: the ACPR50S.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,360
A floating nuclear reactor platform.

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,519
According to state-run People's Daily, the
reactor

21
00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:00,359
"can ensure steady supply of electricity for
oil and gas exploitation,

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,280
and for islands development."

23
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,379
You know, islands development.

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,320
Like the artificial islands they're "developing"
in the South China Sea.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,670
Now technically, this won't be the world's
first floating nuclear reactor.

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,670
That title would go to the United States'
fleet

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,550
of over a hundred nuclear powered vessels,
like submarines.

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,950
The difference is, China's will be used as
a nuclear generator,

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,820
not just for propulsion of the ship it's installed
in.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,800
And to be fair, the US's nuclear fleet has
proven to be safe.

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,180
Slapping a made-in-China sticker on it though,

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,540
might be a different matter.

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,220
Construction will be in the hands of the state-owned

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,480
China General Nuclear Power Corp.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,840
They aim to complete it by 2020.

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,490
Russia is expected to complete their own even
sooner, by 2017.

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,930
But China has even bigger nuclear ambitions.

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,520
China already has 30 nuclear power plants,
with 24 under construction.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,420
By 2050, China hopes to increase its nuclear
energy generated by 100 fold.

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,890
China's nuclear push is probably not meant
to compete with its rival Japan

41
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,870
in the number of radioactive monsters...

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,580
But it's more an attempt to make China not
look like this.

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,360
Because everyone knows, if you want to protect
the environment,

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,940
nuclear energy is the clear winner.

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,210
What do you think of China's plan to build
a floating nuclear reactor?

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,580
And how do you feel about radioactive monsters?
