1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,580
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,820
can China solve the North Korea nuclear problem?

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,879
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,339
I’m Shelley Zhang,

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:14,509
filling in for Chris Chappell,

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,870
who’s on “vacation” in an undisclosed
location

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,740
that is nowhere near the People’s Republic
of China.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,480
Speaking of “people’s republics,”

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,000
North Korea.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Last weekend,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,060
North Korean dictator and inventor of the
Chairman Mao high fade

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,090
Kim Jong-un

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,969
announced that his military was close to testing

14
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,129
a ballistic missile with the capability

15
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:38,690
to reach the United States.

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,690
The good news

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,940
is that North Korea isn’t especially successful

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,409
at testing missiles.

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,409
However,

20
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,359
this is one more step towards developing

21
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,920
a nuclear warhead that can reach the US.

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,149
Why are we talking about this on China Uncensored?

23
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,149
Because on Monday,

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,999
Donald Trump responded to Kim’s announcement,

25
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,569
adding his second favorite country to the
mix.

26
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,069
Hint: It’s not North Korea.

27
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:04,910
“China has been taking out massive amounts

28
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,860
of money & wealth from the U.S.

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,940
in totally one-sided trade,

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,960
but won’t help with North Korea.

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Nice!”

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Nice?

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
Imagine using sarcasm when talking about China.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Anyway,

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,830
it would appear that Trump’s policy directive—

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,690
as much as I can tell from 140 characters—

37
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,800
is that he wants to force the Chinese Communist
Party

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,910
to force North Korea to stop

39
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,920
its nuclear weapons program.

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,780
It’s actually something Trump has been pretty
consistent about.

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,030
Here he is on CBS in February,

42
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,840
implying that he could get China to possibly
assassinate Kim.

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,870
“I would get China to get make that guy
disappear,

44
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,870
in one form or another,

45
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,040
very quickly.

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,580
And let me tell you, people say, ‘oh’...”

47
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,460
“How do you make him disappear?

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Assassinate him?

49
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
“Let me just tell you.

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,060
No.

51
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Well, you know, I’ve heard of worse things,
frankly.

52
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,420
This guy’s a bad dude.

53
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,760
And don’t underestimate him.”

54
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,180
Mmm.

55
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,700
But is he a bad enough dude to bomb the US?

56
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,550
And can President Trump force China

57
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,950
to abandon North Korea

58
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,020
using economic pressure?

59
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,460
Well, leaving aside the complex economic entanglements

60
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,990
between the US and China,

61
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,440
here’s the thing:

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,130
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is already kind
of doing that

63
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,819
without being forced.

64
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,340
At least, he’s been moving China away from
decades

65
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,720
of close ties with North Korea.

66
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
For example,

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,700
two years after Xi Jinping rose to power,

68
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,060
he snubbed North Korea

69
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,860
by making an official state visit to South
Korea first.

70
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,230
In fact,

71
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,190
he still hasn’t met with Kim Jong-un.

72
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
In addition,

73
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,970
China supported recent UN sanctions

74
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,410
against North Korea,

75
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,100
and even helped enforce the international
trade embargo.

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,030
Including investigating a Chinese company

77
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,990
that had provided North Korea with uranium-enrichment
ingredients.

78
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,480
But before you start thinking,

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
“Wow, Xi Jinping is a great guy.

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,510
I want him to name my first-born daughter”

81
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,890
*cough* Zuckerberg—

82
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,760
you should know that his real motivation is,

83
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
yes,

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,349
the unending power struggle between Xi Jinping

85
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,330
and his toad-like predecessor Jiang Zemin.

86
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Yes,

87
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,080
it’s time to once again examine

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,450
the crimes of this dehydrated amphibian.

89
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,940
The one who rose to power

90
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,360
through the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,160
and sanctioned the widespread murder of prisoners
of conscience

92
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,880
for their organs.

93
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,680
According to this Radio Free Asia report,

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,319
Jiang Zemin started giving nuclear material
to North Korea

95
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,970
back in 1989,

96
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,480
after previous Chinese leaders refused to.

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Allegedly,

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,770
he wanted to retaliate against the United
States

99
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,440
and other hostile foreign forces who unfairly
criticized

100
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,680
the Communist Party for its peaceful handling

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,010
of students in Tiananmen Square.

102
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,010
So,

103
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,640
Jiang Zemin may have helped North Korea

104
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,360
build a nuclear weapons program.

105
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,330
Even after Jiang Zemin stepped down,

106
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:02,950
his number two guy helped maintain that buddy
buddy relationship.

107
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,260
But not to worry,

108
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,490
there's still the number three guy,

109
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,390
and the number four guy.

110
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,430
And that Chinese company

111
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,120
who sold nuclear materials to North Korea?

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,660
Looks like it also has ties to officials in
Jiang’s faction.

113
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
Shocking.

114
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
So essentially,

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,169
the future of the China-North Korea relationship

116
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,870
is tied to the Chinese Communist Party’s

117
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,430
internal power struggle.

118
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,200
And as Xi Jinping purges his political enemies,

119
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
he’s also purging the Sino-North Korea relationship—

120
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,960
because his political enemies were the ones

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,160
who built that relationship.

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
The Chinese Communist Party

123
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,700
is in a tricky situation here.

124
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
For years,

125
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,130
as North Korea’s biggest trading partner
and aid giver,

126
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,060
they managed to keep the country at a finely
tuned level of crazy.

127
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,980
Just crazy enough to bother the US

128
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,670
and make China look good,

129
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,630
while not crazy enough to collapse and cause
a massive influx

130
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,990
of refugees across China’s border.

131
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,990


132
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,990
But now,

133
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,190
as North Korea gets increasingly drunk on
the world stage,

134
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,030
China is acting like the embarrassed college
roommate

135
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,169
who wants to pretend that they don’t know
North Korea,

136
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,760
who is a fully grown adult responsible for
their own actions.

137
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,250
It’s totally not China’s fault, you guys.

138
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,139
But we all know who’s going to have to hold
North Korea’s hair

139
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,850
as they vomit over the toilet.

140
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,090
So China’s coldness towards North Korea
over the last four years

141
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,940
is not because of Obama.

142
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,340
And it’s unlikely to be reinforced by Trump,
either.

143
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,510
Especially if Trump’s policies come in Tweets.

144
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,480
I mean Twitter is banned in China,

145
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,390
so Trump really shouldn’t expect Xi Jinping
to read them.

146
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,060
Ok, I guess someone is reading his tweets.

147
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,479
So what do you think?

148
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,020
Leave your comments below.

149
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,280
Once again, I’m Shelley Zhang,

150
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,660
filling in for Chris Chappell until he gets
back next week.
