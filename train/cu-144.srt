00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,850
China is jumping on the creepy

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,040
science experiment bandwagon,

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,140
and boy is it weird.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,860
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,409
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,940
History is no stranger to

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,240
creepy science experiments.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,570
The Nazis did them.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,290
Imperial Japan did them, too.

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,680
And let’s not forget Dr. Frankenstein.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,520
And, you know, the great thing about being

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,200
an authoritarian country without mechanisms

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,700
for public oversight,

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,809
is there aren’t that many restrictions

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,480
when it comes to experimenting on animals...

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,969
and people.

18
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:39,120
So today we bring you

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,210
the top 5 creepy Chinese science experiments

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,379
sure to send shivers down your spine.

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,579
Number 5: Cloning

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,309
First, there was Dolly.

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,229
“I’m Dolly, I’m a sheep from Roslin,

24
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,840
and people like to make a big fuss

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,059
about the fact that I’m a clown.

26
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,059
Clone!

27
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,059
Clone!”

28
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,819
Oh, Dolly, you’re so hilarious.

29
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,780
Dolly the sheep was the first ever animal

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,230
to be successfully cloned from an adult cell.

31
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,540
Now that’s a big deal because, well,

32
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,050
it proves that in theory,

33
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,160
the adult me that I know and love,

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,220
could create an exact copy of...myself.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh what’s that Dolly?

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,410
I mean Shelley?

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,410
Oh.

38
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,520
It turns out Dolly was a “lower order species”

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,050
and didn’t really prove I can clone myself.

40
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,140
But that’s changed now,

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,260
thanks to a recent experiment in China.

42
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,260
“Well scientists from Shanghai have done
it again.

43
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,270
But this time,

44
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,020
they’ve cloned a couple of adorable

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,100
macaque monkeys.”

46
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,940
They’re named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua,

47
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,340
which is a cute way of saying,

48
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,600
“Chinese nation.”

49
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,960
Because nothing says patriotism

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,920
like science experiments on monkeys

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,960
where most of them died.

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,660
Seriously, they implanted 79 embryos

53
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,990
and only 2 of them survived.

54
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,050
With results like that,

55
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,200
I definitely would have failed biology class.

56
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,310
Maybe there’s an easier way

57
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,470
for me to clone myself?

58
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,820
But anyway, technically,

59
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,300
these are not the first-ever monkey clones.

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,780
In 2000, scientists cloned a rhesus monkey

61
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,450
named Tetra.

62
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,450
But that was done using

63
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,640
the much simpler method

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,330
of splitting embryos.

65
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,640
This new experiment,

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,190
which was reported in January 2018,

67
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,510
is far more advanced.

68
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,740
According to one researcher,

69
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,530
this new technology could be used

70
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,810
to clone humans.

71
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,390
But don’t worry!

72
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,700
Researchers assure us they have

73
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,850
no intention of doing that.

74
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,950
“We will never try,

75
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,950
and I don’t think there’s anybody

76
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,330
are willing to do human cloning,

77
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,550
and society would not permit it.

78
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,840
But like any new technology,

79
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,390
once it appears,

80
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,470
there’s always the possibility of misuse.”

81
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,950
The misuse of technology for a sinister purpose?

82
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,370
The Chinese Communist Party would never allow
that.

83
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,770
Let’s just focus on the good parts.

84
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,370
“But let’s be honest.

85
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,670
We just care that these lovable monkeys

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,220
are so darn cute.”

87
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,580
Awwww...

88
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,520
Number 4: Animal head transplant

89
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,900
Back in 2013,

90
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,490
a Chinese doctor became the first scientist

91
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,170
to take the head from one mouse

92
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,319
and “successfully” attach it

93
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,110
to the body of another.

94
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,140
“Ren says after having its head

95
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,030
placed onto a new body,

96
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,489
the mouse opened its eyes,

97
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,489
could breathe,

98
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,770
and make basic movements.”

99
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,430
Oh and then it died a day later.

100
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,580
What more could you ask for

101
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,750
in a successful surgery?

102
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,220
And Dr. Ren Xiaoping has conducted

103
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,569
over a thousand such “successful”

104
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,860
mouse head transplants.

105
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,270
An army of frankenmice.

106
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,190
Somehow, it’s still adorable.

107
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,520
But it turns out the good doctor

108
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
was just warming up.

109
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,150
All those rodents were just the appetizer

110
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,770
ahead of the main course––

111
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,200
a monkey head.

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,880
“Before we can transplant a head,

113
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,680
we connect it and the body

114
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,220
with a tube like this.

115
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,970
This ensures that when the head

116
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,840
is moved, the circulation isn’t cut.”

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,520
According to a 2016 report by the New Scientist,

118
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,930
Dr. Ren pulled off the daring feat…

119
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,780
I mean the head…

120
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,019
off a monkey and reattached it

121
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,370
to the body of another monkey.

122
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,650
The monkey survived,

123
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,621
but was only kept alive for 20 hours

124
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,060
after the procedure—

125
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,340
for ethical reasons, he said.

126
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Which is to say,

127
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,190
“The monkey could totally have survived

128
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,610
longer it we wanted it to.

129
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,640
We swear.

130
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,930
It’s all about the ethics.”

131
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,380
Yes, frankenmonkeys are all about the ethics.

132
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,030
Let’s just move ahead, shall we?

133
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,190
Number 3: Human head transplant

134
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,710
Well, it turns out a monkey head wasn’t
quite

135
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,300
headline material enough for Dr. Ren Xiaoping.

136
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,350
“The head transplant is the last

137
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,550
and greatest challenge of the human medical
science.

138
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,120
We’ve never confronted it before.”

139
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,460
At a press conference in December,

140
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,470
his colleague,

141
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,730
Italian doctor Sergio Canavero,

142
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,710
dropped the bombshell.

143
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,430
“The surgery happened—successfully.”

144
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,430
Well if it’s the same kind of “successfully”

145
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,390
as with the mice and the monkey…

146
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,400
Oh wait.

147
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,420
What’s that?

148
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,980
“The first full rehearsal has taken place
in China.”

149
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,540
A full rehearsal?

150
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,820
What does that mean?

151
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,900
“The surgery lasted 18 hours...”

152
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Aaaannndddd....?

153
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,810
“In a few days, Xiaoping will announce

154
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,760
and will give you all the ins and outs.”

155
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,370
Oh, what an anti-climax.

156
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,620
Well it turns out Dr. Ren Xiaoping

157
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,770
did give all the ins and outs,

158
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,650
in this article in Surgical Neurology International.

159
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,090
First of all, just to let you know,

160
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,930
the experiment was approved by

161
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,600
a Chinese ethics board

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,150
and the families of the cadavers consented.

163
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,060
Still, I’m gonna need to see

164
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,919
a copy of those consent forms,

165
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,740
if you don’t mind.

166
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,540
But in conclusion, drum roll please…

167
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,479
Dr. Ren says that the test run head graft

168
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,479
was a great success!

169
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,710
And by success,

170
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,070
he meant both test subjects were dead.

171
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,900
No, the surgery didn’t kill them.

172
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,000
He just did the experiment on dead bodies.

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,740
So...take that “success” with a grain
of salt.

174
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,420
So what exactly is the plan now?

175
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,550
“The next step is a full head transplant

176
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,820
on a brain-dead organ donor,

177
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,660
and the first human head transplant is imminent.”

178
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,260
So first a frankenmouse,

179
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,850
then a frankenmonkey,

180
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,560
and now a franken...stein?

181
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,100
I can’t wait.

182
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,130
Number 2: Easy organ “donation”

183
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,759
This creepy science experiment involves

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,920
figuring out how to use the internal organs

185
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,270
from prisoners executed by lethal injection.

186
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,070
Now, if you’ve been watching

187
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,660
China Uncensored for a while,

188
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,139
you’ve probably seen some episodes

189
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,600
about China’s organ donation program.

190
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,690
And for those of you who are new to the show,

191
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,449
in China, “donation” means they kill you

192
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,320
and take your organs.

193
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,979
A lot of China’s involuntary organ donors

194
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,960
are prisoners who are given the death penalty.

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,850
And in China you can be given the death penalty

196
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,640
for things like economic crimes.

197
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,210
But there’s a problem.

198
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,300
Prisoners are now executed

199
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,720
using lethal injection,

200
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,850
so the organs get poisoned too.

201
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,120
That means, after the transplant is done,

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,360
the host body often rejects the organ.

203
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,730
But thanks to the groundbreaking research

204
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,600
of one Wang Lijun,

205
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,990
China can continue to extract organs

206
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,819
from unwilling donors and not worry about
a thing.

207
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,180
According to the China Organ Harvest Research
Center,

208
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,539
“Wang Lijun carried out thousands

209
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,430
of what were effectively live human experiments”

210
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,350
and his team “made step-by-step scientific
success

211
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,240
in making it possible for an organ to be accepted

212
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,860
by the recipient after lethal injections.”

213
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,740
By the way, Wang Lijun is not a scientist
or a doctor.

214
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,800
He was a police chief who worked with

215
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,699
purged former CCP official Bo Xilai.

216
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,139
Wang is the guy that fled

217
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,289
to the US Consulate in 2012

218
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,300
and triggered a huge scandal that

219
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,259
exposed the factional fighting within the
CCP.

220
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,389
And he’s now serving a 15-year prison sentence

221
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:24,940
for corruption.

222
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,770
Sounds like just the kind of guy

223
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,009
who should be working on

224
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,940
cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs

225
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,459
involving dicey ethical issues.

226
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,140
Wang’s research paved the way

227
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,120
for organ “donations” from

228
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,630
even more unwilling donors:

229
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
Prisoners of conscience,

230
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,140
like Falun Gong practitioners,

231
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
house Christians,

232
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,290
Uighurs, and Tibetans.

233
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,380
These are different from prisoners

234
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,040
given the death penalty,

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,000
since they are imprisoned for their beliefs

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,310
and then just quietly “disappeared”

237
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,880
into the system.

238
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
And according to reports,

239
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,050
there are a lot of them.

240
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes, political prisoners can rest easy now,

241
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,890
knowing that the organs forcibly plucked

242
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,000
from their bodies will give the gift of life

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,820
to wealthy Chinese patients

244
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,110
without any poisonous side effects.

245
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,480
And number one:

246
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,660
Human body plastination

247
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,720
Plastination means taking human bodies

248
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,120
and turning them into human Ken and Barbie
dolls

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,060
to be put on display for fun and profit.

250
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,300
Haha.

251
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,460
That looks like so much fun.

252
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,529
Chinese scientist Sui Hongjin learned

253
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,560
the creepy craft of plastinating human bodies

254
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,149
by teaming up with the creepy German anatomist

255
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,340
who invented the technique.

256
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,390
But the two parted ways and Sui Hongjin

257
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,050
later set up his own plant in China

258
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,520
and perfected the art-slash-science

259
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,430
of turning people into plastic.

260
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,110
He churned out human bodies set in all kinds
of

261
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,380
bizarre poses and sold them to international
exhibitions.

262
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,000
And he made a killing.

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,680
Well, actually someone else did the killing.

264
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,240
You see, Chinese people tend not to

265
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,890
donate their bodies to science.

266
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,420
Then where did all these bodies come from?

267
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,610
Well, at first Sui Hongjin implied they were
donated.

268
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,290
Then he said he didn’t know.

269
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,560
Then, after a lawsuit,

270
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,310
the exhibitions were forced to put up a disclaimer,

271
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,610
saying that they got the bodies from the Chinese
police.

272
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,420
And the police may have gotten them

273
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,490
from Chinese prisons.

274
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,910
So... probably no consent forms.

275
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,610
Can we go back to the frankenmice?

276
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,610
That was a lot less disturbing.

277
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,610
Well, those are 5 creepy

278
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,610
Chinese science experiments.

279
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,610
I’m sure we’ll all sleep well tonight.

280
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,610
And coming up after the break,

281
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,610
I sit down with Benedict Rogers

282
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,610
to talk about the future of political rights

283
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,610
in Hong Kong.

284
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,610
So what do you think about the top 5

285
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,610
creepy Chinese science experiments?
