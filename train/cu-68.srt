00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,229
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,909
the future of Chinese law enforcement is...

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,180
“Exterminate! Exterminate!”

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,200
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,510
Perhaps someday I, too, will be replaced by
a robot.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,480
“Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,430
I’m your host, Sarcastabot 3000.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,730
Have you ever noticed that sometimes things
seem one way,

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,510
but are actually a different way?

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,739
Ha ha ha ha.”

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,589
But until that day,

12
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,739
it’s my job to show you this:

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,940
The possible future of Chinese law enforcement.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,890
Meet AnBot.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,100
This concept robot was developed by China’s
National Defense University.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,499
It was unveiled last month at the Chongqing
Hi-Tech Fair.

17
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,609
Soon, all Chinese people can enjoy

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,339
the ’round-the-clock surveillance that was
once reserved

19
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,920
only for dissidents and human rights lawyers.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,679
Now I know it looks suspiciously like a cross
between

21
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,860
a Dalek from Doctor Who and an a giant Tamagotchi.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,110
But don’t worry!

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,470
The AnBots won't get sick if you forget to
clean up after them.

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,650
And they aren’t bent on exterminating all
inferior species.

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,660
Just people with inferior political views.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,060
No, just kidding.

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,860
They’re not here to kill you.

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,810
Yet. They’re still just in the concept phase.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,450
According to state-run People's Daily,

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,380
one purpose of the AnBot is

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,000
to “help with police officers’ anti-riot
missions.”

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,810
And to do that,

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,590
it comes equipped with a helpful “electrical
anti-riot device.”

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,470
Hmm... I wonder where they got the idea

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,250
of a weaponized robot for urban deployment.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:51,380
“It gives me great pleasure to introduce  you to the future of law enforcement: ED-209.”

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,050
Where nothing could possibly go wrong.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,460
Um, anyway, the AnBot’s device is probably
more like a taser.

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,789
And tasers are pretty much harmless.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,930
Oh.

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,000
At least you can outrun it.

42
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,280
At 11 miles per hour.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,160
Or until you can find a staircase.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,140
Anyway, the AnBot is designed mainly for patrolling,

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,989
which it can do autonomously

46
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,349
as in, it will roam around on its own,

47
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,400
unless someone specifically controls it remotely.

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,180
And it can watch and listen to anything around
it,

49
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,730
so keep those subversive thoughts to yourself.

50
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,239
But before you think,

51
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,590
“I can’t believe China would deploy robot
police on an unsuspecting populace,”

52
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,170
well, the AnBot...looks suspiciously like
a Chinese knockoff

53
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,909
of the American K-5

54
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,029
an unarmed robot police unit developed two
years ago in Silicon Valley.

55
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,840
Wow. I'm not sure if that was an ad for robot
police

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,180
or our new robot overlords.

57
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,319
One of the creators says:

58
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,930
“It can see, feel, hear, and smell.”

59
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,219
Ah, the future. Where robots can smell your
fear.

60
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,480
But for now, this is all just theoretical.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,129
Techies showing off their prototypes.

62
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,230
But if they were ever deployed in China, well,
watch out.

63
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,980
Because if this happens again,

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,379
the tank driver bots won't be programmed to
stop.

65
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,019
So how do you feel about the impending future
where robots become the police?
