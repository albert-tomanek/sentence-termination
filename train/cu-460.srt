1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,840
The Biden Administration finally meets with China

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Is Biden striking a tough stance?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,880
Or is China running the show

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,600
This week marks the first\h
high-level meeting between\h\h

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,480
the Biden Administration and Chinese\h
officials. And a lot is at stake.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,080
But first, I got to tell you, YouTube has been\h
demonetizing us a lot. For this show to continue,\h\h

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,760
we need your support on the crowd funding website\h
Patreon. For as little as a dollar an episode,\h\h

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,720
you can help us continue to uncensor China.\h

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,120
So as I said, this is the first showdown\h
between the Biden Administration and China.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,800
The meeting happened in Alaska. This is\h
a big deal. Biden (Corner Box) has not\h\h

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,440
made his administration’s China policy\h
clear yet. He’s still reviewing a lot\h\h

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,120
of Trump administration China policies,\h
from bans on Chinese apps like WeChat.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,320
To tariffs.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
To even whether to label the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s persecution of Uyghurs as genocide.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Some people have the impression the\h
Biden Administration is soft on China.\h\h

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,080
That’s because of past China failures\h
from key administration officials,\h\h

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
as well as the fallout from\h
the Hunter Biden scandal.\h

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
But President Biden doesn’t\h
want to be seen as soft.\h\h

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,720
So in the lead up to the first meeting, the\h
Biden Administration struck a tough stance.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Secretary of State Antony Blinken made his\h
first trip to Asia. And it was all about China.\h

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,840
First stop was Japan. Blinken was joined\h
by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,040
A warning to China from U.S. Secretary\h
of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday,\h\h

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
as he cautioned it against\h
using "coercion and aggression".

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Blinken was specifically calling out the\h
Chinese regime’s actions in the South China Sea.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,040
“We're united in the vision of a free and open\h
Indo-Pacific region, where countries follow the\h\h

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,160
rules, cooperate whenever they can, and resolve\h
their differences peacefully. And in particular\h\h

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,600
we will push back if necessary when China\h
uses coercion or aggression to get its way.”

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,920
China was obviously not happy about that.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,280
But then he was off to South Korea.\h
Where he had a pretty similar message.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,160
“China is using coercion and aggression to\h
systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong,\h\h

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse\h
human rights and Xinjiang in Tibet\h\h

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,240
and assert maritime claims in the South\h
China Sea that violate international law.”

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
And speaking of Hong Kong,\h\h

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,280
the Biden Administration has just\h
announced their first Chinese sanctions.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,960
They’re sanctioning 24 Chinese\h
and Hong Kong officials over\h\h

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,520
the latest crackdown on Hong Kong’s Democracy.

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,280
Which is great news. However, these\h
officials were already sanctioned by Trump.\h

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
“All of these officials, who include senior\h
Chinese lawmakers and Hong Kong-based security\h\h

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
officials, had already been hit with\h
sanctions by the Trump administration.”

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:33,040
Trump’s sanctions froze the US assets of these\h
24 officials, banned them from entering the US,\h\h

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,080
and stopped Americans from doing\h
business with these officials.\h

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Biden’s sanctions now also punish\h
any foreign financial institutions\h\h

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,640
that conduct business with these officials,\h
even if those institutions aren’t American.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
The new sanctions were made\h
under the Hong Kong Autonomy Act,\h\h

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,520
bipartisan legislation that was passed last\h
year. The Trump administration had also used\h\h

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,760
that act to sanction many high ranking officials,\h
including Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam.

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
We did an episode last year on why\h
these sanctions are so powerful.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
It’s nice to see Biden and Trump\h
agreeing on so many things.\h

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,520
But the Biden administration’s ramp up to this\h\h

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,160
high-level meeting wasn’t just about\h
Hong Kong. Days before the meeting,\h\h

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
the US government also approved the export\h
of sensitive submarine parts for Taiwan.

54
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
That will help Taiwan protect itself\h
from a potential Chinese invasion.\h\h

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,480
Unless those sensitive submarine\h
parts are screen doors.

56
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,560
A big question on everyone’s mind\h
is how Biden will handle Trump’s\h\h

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
tariffs on China and the phase one trade deal.\h\h

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,520
But according to National Security Advisor Jake\h
Sullivan, that won’t be a focus in the talks.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,840
Instead he suggested the talks will focus\h
on big picture strategy and American values.

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,920
At a White House press briefing, he said, “This\h
is our effort to communicate clearly to the\h\h

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Chinese government how the United States intends\h
to proceed at a strategic level, what we believe\h\h

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,200
our fundamental interests and values are, and\h
what our concerns with their activities are.”

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,520
I hope that clear communication involves\h
telling the Chinese government to:\h\h

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,920
Stop. Committing. Genocide.

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,520
And after the break, Apple may be getting\h
nervous about slave labor in China.

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,440
Welcome back.

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,960
It looks like Apple has cut ties\h
with the Chinese company Ofilm.\h\h

68
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
They make selfie cameras for the iPhone. And\h
may have been using slave labor from Xinjiang.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Apple’s massive supply chain\h
has a lot of links in China.\h\h

70
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,240
That’s why Apple has lobbied so hard against\h
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.\h

71
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Meanwhile, Ofilm told investors\h
it had lost a “particular\h\h

72
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,920
overseas client” but didn’t name the client.

73
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,960
So why did Apple drop Ofilm?\h
Well, according to reports,\h\h

74
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Apple dropped Ofilm a few months ago. That would\h
have been after Ofilm was listed in this report\h\h

75
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,200
as a company that used Uyghur slave labor.

76
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,160
So good on Apple for doing something about it. But\h
considering how widespread Uyghur forced labor is,\h\h

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
Apple will need to do a lot\h
more than drop one supplier\h\h

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,080
to make sure its iPhones aren’t\h
made with some kind of slave labor.

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,480
Speaking of the Uyghurs, Australia joins Turkey\h\h

80
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,600
in refusing to call China’s\h
persecution of Uyghurs a genocide.

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,320
I mean, you don’t want to be seen as doing\h
business with acountry that commits genocide.\h\h

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,000
So just don’t label it genocide.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,600
So despite the 3 billion dollars lost in the\h
trade war China launched against Australia...

84
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
clearly there are still enough people\h
in the Australian government who\h\h

85
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
hope to one day get rich\h
again by working with China.

86
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,960
And some good news for people who still want\h
to travel to mainland China for some reason.\h\h

87
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,000
It’s easier to get in, as long as you get\h
vaccinated. But only with the Chinese vaccine.

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,640
At least one of the Chinese vaccines\h
is only about 50% effective. But hey,\h\h

89
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,200
the Communist Party would rather people use their\h
vaccine and be more at risk, than the alternative.

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,640
But remember, everyone, according Chinese\h
state-run media, vaccine nationalism is bad.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
But if you do get into China after\h
taking one of their vaccines,\h\h

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,640
no word yet on whether or not you’ll\h
be exempted from the anal swabs.\h

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,200
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 cent army,\h\h

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
fans who support the show on Patreon.

95
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,200
Today’s question comes from:

96
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,080
Arpanet-at-Cern “Hey Chris, any update on\h
when/if the China Uncensored merch store\h\h

97
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,880
will be back? I'm still itching to\h
grab some for my friends and family.\h\h

98
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,680
Also, great job as always to you and the team.”

99
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Great question! We actually do have a merch\h
store on our website, ChinaUncensored.tv.

100
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,600
But it’s only in soft-launch. You can buy one\h
of our t-shirt designs now. But we’re waiting\h\h

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,840
to do a big public launch until after we get\h
our new China Uncensored logo and graphics.

102
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,600
That’s being done by the same team that\h
made the America Uncovered graphics.\h\h

103
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Once we have that done, we’ll do a video\h
about the merch store. So stay tuned.

104
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
And remember, the reason we’re\h
able to update our graphics is\h\h

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,840
thanks to the amazing support\h
from viewers like you on Patreon.\h\h

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Because of YouTube demonetization, we\h
wouldn’t have enough money to run the show,\h\h

107
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,680
let alone improve the look of it. So a big thank\h
you to everyone who contributes on Patreon.

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
If you’d like to join Arpanent\h
at Cern as a member of the China\h\h

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,560

Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn more.

110
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
