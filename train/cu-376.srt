1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,280
How is China responding to the US election?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,840
You won’t believe who’s\h
criticizing US human rights

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,120
And a journey to the center of the Earth!

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
Confused about the US election?\h\h

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,720
Don’t worry, you’re not alone. The Chinese\h
Communist Party is also really confused.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,080
While many world leaders have congratulated\h
Joe Biden on becoming president-elect,\h\h

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,720
the trifecta of world strongmen have not. Xi\h
Jinping, along with Vladmir Putin and Kim Jong-Un\h\h

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,080
have not acknowledged Joe Biden. Actually,\h
I’m not sure if the Supreme Leader of North\h\h

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,360
Korea has ever congratulated\h
a US President on winning.\h

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,520
Why haven’t they? It could be the ongoing\h
accusations of Voter Fraud being made by the Trump\h\h

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,680
Campaign. After all, these guys probably have\h
more experience with rigged elections than a free\h\h

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,840
democratic process. Ok, technically only one of\h
them has to even bother with rigging elections.\h

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,720
The point is, the official response from the\h
Chinese Communist Party has been incredibly muted.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
Chinese authorities feign indifference.\h
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang\h\h

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Wenbin said on Nov. 4 that “the U.S. election is\h
a domestic affair. China has no position on it.”\h\h

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Chinese media staff told Radio Free Asia that\h
they have received notice from the Chinese\h\h

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,240
Communist Party, asking them to “follow state\h
media sources.” The notice also warned them\h\h

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,320
not to translate foreign media coverage\h
without official approval and “not to\h\h

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,600
inflame excessive emotions, and prevent public\h
opinion from becoming heated and sidetracked.”

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Hey, let’s not focus too much on elections\h
in case people in China start getting ideas.\h

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,200
However, certain Chinese state-run media\h
have been more vocal. Especially in English.\h

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,640
My favorite State-Run Media, the Global Times,\h\h

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,880
called President Elect Biden\h
an old friend for the Chinese.

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,880
State-run China Daily said under Biden,\h
US-China relations can be reset for the better.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,120
I wonder from whose\h
perspective it would be better?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,440
The Legal Daily, a newspaper run by\h
China’s internal security forces,\h\h

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,320
declared Biden the winner saying, “The\h
world can be a little bit relieved\h\h

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,680
because we won’t have the over two-month\h
election dispute like Bush v. Gore in 2000.”

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,800
I have never in my life wanted to believe Chinese\h
state-run media was right until this very moment.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
So the Chinese Communist Party and\h
state-run media may have different takes.\h\h

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
The Chinese people themselves\h
also have their own takes.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,480
There are two opposing views among Chinese\h
people. Hua Po said:“Fanatic nationalists,\h\h

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,320
such as the little pinks (pro-CCP youths), are\h
very much afraid that Trump will be reelected.\h\h

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,920
Those who oppose the CCP are just the opposite.\h
For them, living under the CCP’s rule is a big\h\h

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,960
tragedy. They hope that President Trump will\h
be elected for a second term, so that he can\h\h

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,840
continue to be tough on the CCP. They even hope\h
that President Trump can put an end to the CCP.”

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Trump is no fan of communism. November 7 was\h
the National Day for the Victims of Communism.\h\h

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,560
And despite, you know, having other things\h
to worry about, Trump issued a statement.

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
He said, “While Marxism promises equality,\h\h

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,920
peace, and happiness, in practice it results\h
only in inequality, violence, and despair.”

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
“As proud Americans who cherish the\h
blessings of freedom and democracy,\h\h

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
we promise to support the more than\h
one billion people currently captive\h\h

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,600
within communist regimes and denied their\h
unalienable rights to life and liberty.”

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,080
Okay...so in today’s episode I’ve agreed with\h
both Chinese state-run media and Donald Trump.\h\h

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,320
Oh 2020, what surprises will you bring next.\h

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley\h
is taking aim at Joe Biden’s son,\h\h

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,600
Hunter. He wrote to the Department of Justice\h
saying the Biden family’s close dealings\h\h

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,320
with state linked Chinese companies\h
and individuals is a major problem.

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,320
“The actions by Hunter Biden and James Biden on\h
behalf of CEFC [a state linked energy company],\h\h

52
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,480
[its founder] Ye Jianming, and other officers\h
connected to CEFC, potentially make them agents\h\h

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,320
of the Chinese government for purposes\h
of longstanding public disclosure laws.”

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,360
Basically, this is what that would mean: According\h
to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938,\h\h

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
“Agents of foreign governments and\h
entities who are engaged in political\h\h

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
activities or other activities\h
on behalf of the foreign entity\h\h

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,520
[must] disclose their relationship\h
and the details of the activities.”

58
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
Though I think whether or not that flies will\h
depend a lot on who the next President is.\h\h

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,840
If you’d like to know more about Hunter\h
Biden’s business dealings with China,\h\h

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,880
check out the America Uncovered episode,\h
Hunter Biden: How the media screwed it up.\h

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,120
And after the break, Chinese tech\h
stocks are going wild. In a bad way.

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Welcome back.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,120
Huawei, the Chinese telecom company\h
that’s totally private and has no\h\h

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,240
connection to the Chinese state, is selling\h
its phone unit to the Shenzhen government.\h

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,240
A big reason for this is US sanctions on\h
Huawei. The US has banned the sale of US made\h\h

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,760
equipment to Huawei. So Huawei is struggling\h
with production. And judging by the sale,\h\h

67
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,840
it seems like Huawei executives are assuming the\h
US stance on Huawei won’t change anytime soon.

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
Last week, I told you about how the Chinese\h
Communist Party basically blew up Ant Financial's\h\h

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,400
initial public offering after former founder\h
Jack Ma mouthed off about Chinese regulators.

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,400
Well, that decision has wiped out $250\h
billion dollars of Chinese tech stock value.

71
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Basically, everyone is panicking there’s going to\h
be a huge crackdown on China’s tech industry. “On\h\h

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,920
Tuesday, the State Administration for Market\h
Regulations, China's top market regulator,\h\h

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,640
outlined guidelines it says are intended\h
to prevent internet monopolies.”

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,280
It’s still in the draft stage,\h
so they’re encouraging the public\h\h

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
to give their opinion. Ohhhh\h
nice try Chinese regulators.\h

76
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
After 70 years of Communist\h
rule, the Chinese public knows\h\h

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
that they should never, ever give their opinion!

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,320
The United Nations Human Rights Council met this\h
week. And human rights champions Russia, China,\h\h

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,160
Saudi Arabia and North Korea, condemned the\h
United States for its human rights violations.

80
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,600
China, “urged politicians to respect\h
people’s rights to life and health,\h\h

81
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,360
and stop politicizing and stigmatizing COVID-19,”\h\h

82
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,280
and to “combat the increasingly severe\h
religious intolerance and xenophobic violence”.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
Now I was really encouraged to hear this. I\h
had always feared that if we reached a certain\h\h

84
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,240
threshold of irony, the Earth would actually\h
implode. But it turns out that’s not that case.

85
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
By the way, Taiwan was once again rejected from\h\h

86
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
a meeting with the UN backed World\h
Health Organization. Because China.

87
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
More in the ongoing saga of China\h
making the world a healthier place:\h\h

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Brazil’s Health Regulator has suspended\h
Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine trials.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,880
Ohhh, what could be so bad?\h
It cited, “an ‘adverse,\h\h

90
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,560
serious event,’ according to a statement\h
it posted to its website Monday night.”

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,720
Uhh, that doesn’t sound great. But to be\h
fair, Western pharmaceutical companies have\h\h

92
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,320
also previously paused their coronavirus\h
vaccine trials because of adverse events.\h

93
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,640
The Chinese vaccine is called the CoronaVac shot.\h
It’s made by Sinovac, one of the companies I\h\h

94
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,640
talked about in this episode about how the Chinese\h
regime is cutting corners to win the vaccine race.

95
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,720
What’s more worrying about this situation\h
is that Sinovac has already injected\h\h

96
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
lots of people with their vaccine even\h
though it’s still going through trials.\h

97
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,920
In fact, Sinovac has already\h
injected 90 percent of its employees\h\h

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,800
and their family members with this vaccine.\h

99
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,080
The good news is that the vaccine\h
trial has been allowed to restart.

100
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,000
To me, the best way to deal with the CCP\h
Virus, is to stay away from the CCP.\h

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,560
But Pfizer says it might have its own CCP\h
virus vaccine now. More after the break.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,560
Welcome back. US pharmaceutical company\h
Pfizer says it might have a CCP virus vaccine!

103
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
Amazing news! But I wonder why the CEO\h\h

104
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
then decided to sell off a bunch\h
of stock after the announcement.

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,880
Maybe it had to do with this: The US government\h
is looking into Pfizer’s operations in China.

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
Now technically, what happened is that\h
over the summer, the Justice Department\h\h

107
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,320
and SEC made an informal request to see\h
Pfizer’s documents related to China.\h

108
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
But it could uncover something\h\h

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,760
not so good. The Foreign Corrupt Practices\h
Act makes it illegal for a US company to bribe\h\h

110
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,840
foreign government officials. I’m not\h
saying Pfizer is doing that in China.

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,880
That being said, back in 2012, Pfizer had\h
to pay 26 million dollars “to the top U.S.\h\h

112
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,640
securities regulator as part of a settlement with\h
the U.S. government following a probe into its use\h\h

113
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,960
of illegal payments to win business overseas\h
including Russia, Bulgaria, China, and Italy.”

114
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,200
But I’m sure massive pharmaceutical\h
companies and the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

115
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
aren’t getting up to anything\h
suspicious. So don’t worry!

116
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,520
And big news, China has reached an all new low.\h\h

117
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,640
That’s right, China has broken their record for\h
the deepest manned dive in the Mariana Trench.

118
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,920
Now this wasn’t the deepest manned dive in the\h
Mariana Trench. But it was China’s deepest.\h\h

119
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,680
They managed to go almost 36,000 feet below\h
sea level. So, they broke their own record.\h

120
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
The world record is held by an American,\h
who made it a few hundred feet further down.\h\h

121
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
This is obviously part of the\h
race between the US and China for\h\h

122
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,280
who can reach the mole people at\h
the center of the Earth first.\h

123
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,640
Well, joke’s on you China, because America has\h
claimed the mole people since ancient times!\h\h

124
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,480
Thanks to our sixth president, John Quincy Adams.\h

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h\h

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon!

127
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,520
Arpanet-at-Cern asks, “Hey Chris,\h
are those papers that you play with\h\h

128
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,600
on your desk just blank props or is\h
something actually written on them?”

129
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, these? These papers contain a vast array\h
of Uncensored secrets that I’ve been disclosing\h\h

130
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,440
throughout the past 8 years and stretch far\h
into the future. But it’s written in an ink\h\h

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,800
only I can decipher with a specially designed\h
contact lens. I do that to prevent Shelley from\h\h

132
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,480
stealing the papers and taking over the show.\h
She’d use this power for evil, just saying.

133
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
Thanks for your question Arpanet.

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,440
