00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,560
A 14-old-girl was monitored by Chinese police
24/7—

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,800
at home, at school, even in the shower.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,160
Her crime?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,880
You’ll find out when we talk to her.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,640
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,609
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,789
Chinese rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng was once

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,710
celebrated in China for fighting against injustice.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,710
In fact, he was named one of the top ten lawyers
in China

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,410
by the Chinese government.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,239
But they suddenly changed their minds after
Gao

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,800
started going after the biggest source of
injustice in China:

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,260
the Chinese government.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,260
Or more accurately,

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,430
the Chinese Communist Party.

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,670
Authorities shut down Gao’s law firm,

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,140
suspended his license,

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,399
and spent the next few years imprisoning and
torturing Gao

20
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,840
and putting his family under house arrest.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,930
Yes, China is a country with rule of law.

22
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,989
Also, war is peace.

23
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:01,539
Earlier this week, the China Uncensored team

24
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,100
was at the Oslo Freedom Forum in New York,

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,130
a gathering of activists around the world

26
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,360
who are standing up to authoritarian regimes,

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,960
like the Chinese Communist Party.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,070
One of those activists was Gao Zhisheng’s
daughter, Grace Gao.

29
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,750
She sat down with Shelley to discuss her father’s
work

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,320
and her own experiences under house arrest
in China.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,300
Thank you so much for being here, Grace.

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,480
We really appreciate it.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,220
Thank you for having me.

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,560
Can you just tell us a little bit about

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,390
what you remember about your father?

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,000
He's a very loving person,

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,640
and he has a lots of love towards other people,

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
and he always want to share his love.

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,210
He always wanted to help.

40
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,070
And that's how I remember him.

41
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,490
He was, you know, considered one of the best,

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,030
10 best lawyers in China.

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,490
Why did he care so much about his work?

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,300
I think the main reason is he was born in
poverty,

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,950
and he was raised in poverty,

46
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:10,370
and he knows how difficult for poor people
that were like,

47
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,860
you know, those poor people to live,

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,350
to make a living in China,

49
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,480
and he always wanted to help those people
out.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,580
And he says the main problem is the government.

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,870
It's the system.

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,190
So I think that's what he devoted to do.

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,440
That's what he wanted to do.

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,910
In the beginning, he was helping a lot of
these like vulnerable people,

55
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,300
and it seemed like he was being celebrated
for it,

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,880
but then suddenly it seemed like the government
was targeting him.

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,300
Do you know why that happened?

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,750
I think he reached to the core.

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,300
He was writing open letters to the government,

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,590
and he was taking sensitive cases,

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,080
political sensitive cases in China.

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,340
Like persecutions of Falun Gong practitioners.

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,760
The persecutions of Christians.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,590
I think he touched some topics that the government

65
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,040
will never allow anybody to touch it.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,080
But he dared to do it anyway?

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,330
Yeah.

68
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,570
You were quite young when this was happening.

69
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,740
Do you remember any of this?

70
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,000
I was 14.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Everything started when I was 13, 14.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,410
It was a chaos.

73
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,350
There were, when they kidnapped my father,

74
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,500
he was almost never in the picture.

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,470
So it was eight secret agent lived in our
apartment.

76
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:51,260
They take shifts...eight hours shift.

77
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,360
And then there were 20, 30, 40 more secret
agents

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,620
outside of that apartment,in the community.

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,310
They were just constantly observing me, my
brother, and my mom.

80
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,740
They were writing down everything, every activities
that we did.

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,250
So at the time, your dad, they had already
taken your dad away?

82
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Yes.

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,030
Why were they in your house?

84
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,280
They never gave us a reason, even though we
kept asking them,

85
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,560
but I guess they ... I'm guessing they don't
want me or my mom

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,030
reaching out to medias, telling the world
what's happening.

87
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,030
I guess that's a reason.

88
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,640
Or maybe they're just scared.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,060
Were they watching you 24/7?

90
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Yes.

91
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,040
They were watching us 24/7.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,850
They had a notebook.

93
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,450
They were writing down everything that we
did, like,

94
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,310
"Grace woke up at 7:00 a.m. and she took a
shower,"

95
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,070
those kinds of things.

96
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,160
They were watching everything, even the bathroom.

97
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,940
Do you think they were trying to scare you?

98
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,530
Yes, I do.

99
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,430
What about when you went to school?

100
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,320
They wouldn't let me go to school for a long
period of time,

101
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,290
until they finally released my father.

102
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,210
My father fought for my rights to go to school,

103
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,370
and then they were like, "Yes, we can let
you go to school,

104
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,760
but there's one condition."

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,820
The eight secret agents are following me at
all times.

106
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,310
They were sitting outside of the classroom,

107
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,330
and they're tearing down the doors of the
bathroom,

108
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,260
and they had to watch everything that I did.

109
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,530
It was really uncomfortable.

110
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,400
It sounds really traumatic, actually.

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Very traumatic.

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,580
They banned all the students at my school,

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,970
they cannot bring a cell phone to school.

114
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,970
Just think about it.

115
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,450
They're all teenagers.

116
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,260
They're all having their relationships with
their lovers or whatever,

117
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,830
and they can't bring a cell phone.

118
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,610
The principal and the teachers are announcing
this

119
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,240
publicly in my school that nobody can talk
to me,

120
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,270
otherwise their parents will be jailed like
my father.

121
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,160
It sounds like you had a terrible time at
school.

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,760
Very terrible.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Did the teachers also not talk to you?

124
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,940
Well, she did.

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,190
She did in a bad way,

126
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,240
so that everybody else would hate me.

127
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,160
Why did you have to be hated?

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,770
Because I think that's their goal,

129
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,450
to make me a bad person, to make me a target

130
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,710
so that everybody would hate on me,

131
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,180
so that I would feel even more terrible.

132
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,030
How did you get through that?

133
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,610
I just kept telling myself that,

134
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,500
"I'm undergoing all of this because of my
father,

135
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,080
but I know my father, deep in my heart, he
is a good man.

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I don't know the reason why they took him,

137
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,730
but I do know he's a good man."

138
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,510
I just kept telling myself,

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,169
"I need to survive.

140
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,169
I need to be with my family.

141
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,210
I need to be there for them,"

142
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,590
because at the time, my mom, she's not eating
at all.

143
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,760
She's really angry, and she keeps asking them,

144
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,000
"Why are you doing this to our family?"

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,560
They denied to give her any reasons,

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,130
so she is super upset.

147
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,800
She refused to eat for a long period of time.

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
My brother was a baby at the time, two years
old, three years old.

149
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,570
I think I had to be the rock of my family.

150
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,340
That's a lot of pressure for a 14-year-old.

151
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
Yeah.

152
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,000
When your dad was back,

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,540
were the secret agents still watching your
family?

154
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,669
Yes, but not in the apartment, but still.

155
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,639
It was more people, outside of the apartment.

156
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,190
Did you ever talk to your father about what
was happening?

157
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,390
I didn't.

158
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,940
I didn't want him to worry,

159
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,620
because I can see all the scars on his back.

160
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,610
I didn't want him to worry,

161
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,940
so I didn't tell him what was really going
on.

162
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:41,580
I suppose he suffered more.

163
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:48,350
When did your mom decide to take you out of
China?

164
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,850
To be honest, I didn't know when she had the
idea,

165
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,700
but it was 2009, January, the 9th of January.

166
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,660
That morning, she took us to flee from China.

167
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,040
How old were you?

168
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
I was 16.

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,580
Two years of your family being under constant
surveillance.

170
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,540
How did you feel about leaving?

171
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:23,620
Sad, because that morning, everything was
normal.

172
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,140
Somehow, my dad wants to hug us.

173
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,070
My dad hugged my brother really tight

174
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,250
and then hugged my mom really tight.

175
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,460
He gave me a really, really tight hug,

176
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,890
and then he kisses me on the forehead.

177
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,480
I knew something was wrong, but in my family,

178
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,510
we don't talk freely.

179
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,740
We never know there are cameras or anything
in the rooms,

180
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,750
so we don't talk freely.

181
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,680
I can tell there is something wrong,

182
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,830
and then my mom just took us away.

183
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,310
Did you know where you were going?

184
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,680
No.

185
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,510
You eventually made it to America.

186
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
Yeah.

187
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,740
Can you tell us a little bit about

188
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,890
how you got to America from China?

189
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,890
Not really.

190
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,320
I can't give out much details,

191
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,830
because there are still people using the same
method

192
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,230
and the same people we used to flee from China.

193
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,240
I think it's much better that I don't say
anything.

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,230
Essentially, people helped you,

195
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,540
helped smuggle you out of the country.

196
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Yes.

197
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,550
What was it like to come to America?

198
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,960
It was a lot of adjustments.

199
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,510
It was very difficult.

200
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,830
We had to make a living, and we had to keep
on living.

201
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,960
At the same time, we had to do a lot of work
for my father.

202
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,690
We're aware there's an attentions on his case.

203
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,690
It's been tough.

204
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,880
It's been tough, and it's been good.

205
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,120
How is your life in America now?

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Pretty good.

207
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,920
Just graduated,

208
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,920
and I went to travel for a couple months by
myself.

209
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,910
I learned how to dive.

210
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,110
I even go on meditation underwater,

211
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,089
so it's pretty good.

212
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,720
It's pretty peaceful.

213
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,010
That's quite different, hm?

214
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,010
Yeah.

215
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,470
Do you feel like Americans understand

216
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,710
what's happening in China right now?

217
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,730
Not really.

218
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,830
I mean, yes and no.

219
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:49,140
Of course, America understands how worsened
the situation is,

220
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,839
the human rights situation is in China, but
they can't do anything.

221
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,220
They can't do too much about it,

222
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,230
because of the economic factors and the other
factors.

223
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,440
So yes and no.

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,110
After your mom brought you guys to America,

225
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,029
did you lose contact with your father?

226
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,220
Yeah, right away.

227
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,180
Almost right away.

228
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:22,480
I forgot how long was that, but two years
after,

229
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,000
we remained in contact for, I don't know,
a couple weeks.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,480
Then he was off, and then he somehow appeared,

231
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,220
and then he was off.

232
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,460
It's just like this, on and off, on and off.

233
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,460
We're kind of used to this.

234
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,430
When is the last time you talked to your father?

235
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,250
A year ago.

236
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,430
Did you talk on the phone?

237
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,430
Yes.

238
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,470
Usually, we call.

239
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,370
My father is located in a small village where
he was born.

240
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,060
It's in Shaanxi province.

241
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,670
He is under house arrest.

242
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,320
Usually, we call his big brother.

243
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,030
If he's around, the big brother will call
him to talk to us.

244
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,790
If he's not, then it's bad luck.

245
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,010
We can't talk to him that day.

246
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,270
Sometimes, my father will carry the cell phone

247
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,860
and climb up to the mountains to get a better
signal to talk to us,

248
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,910
but it's kind of useless, because everything
we talk about, they...

249
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,649
The Chinese government sees this as politically
sensitive,

250
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,240
so they usually just cut it off.

251
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,360
They can actually cut off your-

252
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,410
Pretty often, actually.

253
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,450
They cut off the phone pretty often, so that
we know,

254
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,840
"Oh, we reached into some sensitive topics."

255
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,160
Sensitive topics like, "How are you doing,
dad?"

256
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,450
Yes, that's the main question.

257
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,540
Every time when I ask him,

258
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
"How are you?

259
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,920
Is your health okay?

260
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,710
Are you feeling good?"

261
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,190
they cut off the line.

262
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,790
Those kinds of questions, my father cannot
answer.

263
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,720
That sounds incredible.

264
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,959
Yeah.

265
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,240
You haven't even been able to do this for
a year, right?

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,890
Do you know where your father is now?

268
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,900
No.

269
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
It's been a year.

270
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,160
We don't know where he is.

271
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,290
Does that mean he is probably in a prison
somewhere?

272
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,580
I think he must be under house arrest or something,

273
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,550
but we don't know the location.

274
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,709
The Chinese government, they denied that they
have him,

275
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,830
but it's almost a sure answer that they have
him, so yeah.

276
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,380
Have you ever thought about what it would
be like

277
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,140
to go back to China?

278
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,290
Actually, I tried.

279
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,630
I tried a couple times,

280
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,930
but I was denied to get my visa.

281
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,450
I had my internship in January in Hong Kong
this year.

282
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,870
I also tried to get my visa from Hong Kong,

283
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,300
and I was denied, too.

284
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,220
Do you feel, then, safe in the U.S.?

285
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,060
Do you feel like they know who you are,

286
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
the Chinese government?

287
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,980
Are they still interested in you,

288
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,310
since they denied you your visa to go back?

289
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,990
Yeah.

290
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,459
That's why I was telling you that

291
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,220
I don't like to have topics about China.

292
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
I don't talk about it.

293
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,490
It makes me feel safer.

294
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,040
It makes me feel like I am not exposed, myself,
too much.

295
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,579
Because in my father's book, Stand Up China
2017,

296
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:49,089
he said the secret agents are telling him
that they have

297
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,519
people around us in America to watch our lives,

298
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,959
so they can give my father some information
to update.

299
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,300
"We want you to surrender, because your family
in America,

300
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,660
they are doing really poorly," this kind of
thing.

301
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,399
We tend to not expose ourselves too much

302
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,200
because we don't feel that safe.

303
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,760
Have you actually had problems directly?

304
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,350
Not really, but it's just we're very alert.

305
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,709
It's pretty tragic that even thousands of
miles away,

306
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,399
the Chinese government can still make you
feel unsafe

307
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,339
and make your father feel threatened.

308
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,220
Have you thought about what you will say to
your dad

309
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,710
the next time you see him?

310
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,279
No.

311
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,850
No.

312
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,339
I almost never thought about this question,

313
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,430
because he is very stubborn, in a way.

314
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,149
He refused to come to America.

315
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,620
He thinks China is his battleground.

316
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,839
He has to stay there.

317
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,829
He has to stay there for people to know

318
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,259
that there are somebody fighting for human
rights and justice.

319
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,039
There are people fighting for them in the
dark.

320
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,399
I don't know when I will be able to see him,

321
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,439
so this question is ...

322
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,679
I almost never thought about it.

323
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,699
Is there anything that people can do o

324
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,610
utside China to help your dad?

325
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,809
I think if you pray, please pray for him.

326
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,999
I think it's important for people who are
outside of China

327
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,739
to know that not just my father,

328
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:44,989
not just the individual case,

329
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:50,070
but there are a bigger problem behind it.

330
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,080
It's the system.

331
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,760
It's the Communists.

332
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
It's the system.

333
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,300
In a thousand ways, it's still wrong.

334
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,480
Thank you so much for talking to us today,
Grace.

335
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,640
Thank you.

336
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,759
I want to give a special thanks

337
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,960
to the staff at the Oslo Freedom Forum

338
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,489
who put us in touch with Grace Gao,

339
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,100
and helped us set up this interview.

340
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,080
Oh, and thanks to Shelley for actually doing
this interview

341
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,750
and to Grace for being willing to talk with
us.

342
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,970
Over the next couple of weeks,

343
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,680
we’ll have even more interviews we shot
at the Oslo Freedom Forum.
