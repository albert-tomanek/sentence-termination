00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,750
it’s the end of the world as we know it!

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,010
And I feel fine.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,760
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,909
War between the US and China.

6
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:20,230
Many of you might think it would go like this.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,539
“AMERICA!…”

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,279
Good luck, yeah.

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,890
Because that’s probably not going to happen.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,380
And according to this report from the RAND
corporation,

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,640
it would actually be “ruinous,” “intense,”
and “destructive.”

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,180
And it would also probably be long and drawn
out.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,870
Sounds familiar, somehow.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,250
By the way, "thinking through the unthinkable"

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,910
apparently describes both war with China

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,670
and Jared Leto's method acting.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,980
Anyway, back to the more appealing subject,

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,660
a War with China.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,190
The report was commissioned by the US Army.

20
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,379
They love a good game of worst-case scenario.

21
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:02,649
Which is why the Pentagon actually has a plan
for a Zombie Outbreak.

22
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:03,960
And one of the report’s authors

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,909
is former chief intelligence adviser to Barack
Obama, David C. Gompert.

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,880
So, depending on your political leanings,

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
he either knows exactly what he’s talking
about

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,940
or is a complete idiot.

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,390
The report does acknowledge

28
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,070
that a war between the US and China is very
unlikely.

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,110
But even though the US’s military lead on
China

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,040
right now may look like Usain Bolt,

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,439
in ten years, the US might not be awkwardly
smiling.

32
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,140
China’s A2/AD

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,760
—or anti-access and area denial—

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,289
technology is making breakthroughs.

35
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,560
And by “making breakthroughs,”

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,790
I mean successfully knocking off technology

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,460
that China steals from the US.

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,860
China's A2/AD technology includes things

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,710
like land-attack and anti-ship ballistic and
cruise missiles,

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,460
a surface-to-air missile network,

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,289
and anti-satellite weapons.

42
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,320
Plus things like cyber warfare

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,320
and China's lesser known psychological warfare
tactics.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,300
Like this secret experimental government footage
shows.

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
As you can see,

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,420
that Chinese opera cover of Rolling in the
Deep

47
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,050
has been carefully and highly weaponized.

48
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,030
And what has the US developed in this critical
field?

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,040
Wow, it's hard to tell which is more destructive.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,100
And as China's technological breakthroughs
continue,

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,310
it will be, as the report says,

52
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,340
“increasingly difficult for the United States

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,850
to gain military-operational dominance and
victory,

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,650
even in a long war.”

55
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,130
“By 2025, U.S. losses could range from significant
to heavy.”

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,230
And this would be,

57
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,680
“a prolonged and destructive, yet inconclusive,
war.”

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,480
The good news is the report suggests

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,680
that neither side would be willing to use
nuclear weapons.

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,550
I mean, this isn’t a game of Civilization
with a rampaging Gandhi.

61
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,160
But there are plenty of hotspots for war with
China.

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,410
And each side is incentivized to strike first.

63
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,460
In other words, if something goes wrong,

64
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,560
like a Chinese vessel accidentally fires

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
on a Japanese ship in the East China Sea,

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,820
it doesn’t pay to take a moment and think
rationally.

67
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,900
After all, only the fate of the world hangs
in the balance.

68
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,210
However, not everyone agrees with the prediction

69
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,790
that China’s military is catching up to
the US,

70
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,940
or will be there even by the year 2025.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,680
Sure, China has upped its military spending
to 155 billion dollars a year.

72
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,360
But America still spends about four times
as much.

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,770
And I hope at least a few billion of that

74
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,980
goes to developing military-grade earplugs.

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,290
So what do you think?

76
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,730
Would war with China be worse than the zombie
apocalypse?

77
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,820
How should the US respond to the threat of
weaponized Chinese opera?

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,040
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you next time.
