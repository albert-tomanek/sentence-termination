1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:03,110
A nuclear War with China

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,060
Is a “real possibility”

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,899
A brazen new attack by Chinese hackers

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,950
And a Chinese government plan to boost “masculinity”

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,980
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,810
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,430
We are in a Cold War with the Chinese Communist
Party.\h

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,260
And what’s a cold war without the threat
of nuclear annihilation?

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,590
A nuclear war with China is a “real possibility”.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,660
That’s according to the head of U.S. Strategic
Command Admiral Charles Richard.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:54,520
He wrote his rather grim summary in this month’s
issue of "Proceedings," the U.S. Naval Institute’s

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
monthly magazine.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,110
“There is a real possibility that a regional
crisis with Russia or China could escalate

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,210
quickly to a conflict involving nuclear weapons,
if they perceived a conventional loss would

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,600
threaten the regime or state.”

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,179
Sort of the Andross model.

17
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:15,380
If I go down, I’m taking you with me.

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,640
“Consequently, the U.S. military must shift
its principal assumption from ‘nuclear employment

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,280
is not possible’ to ‘nuclear employment
is a very real possibility.’”

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Which is why I’m happy to announce a new
company I’m starting called Vault-Tec Industries!

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,090
We’ll build for you the absolute highest
quality fallout shelters, guaranteed not to

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,179
be secret horrific sociological experiments!

23
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:50,920
But you shouldn’t worry too much about Cold
War 2.

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,929
Because first you should worry about proxy
wars!

25
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,409
Once again, China has sent military planes
into Taiwan’s airspace.

26
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,540
But this time, a US military aircraft joined
as well.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,850
And so China took the opportunity to remind
everyone that Taiwan independence means war.

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,050
Obviously, Taiwan is already an independent
country.

29
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,050
China’s not flying provocative warplanes
into their own airspace.

30
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,640
But, uh, let’s not tell them that.\h\h

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,880
So how will the Biden Administration handle
an increasingly aggressive Chinese Communist

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,890
Party?

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,810
A State Department spokesman says Biden wants
to be lockstep with America’s allies on

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,110
China.\h

35
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,330
Hopefully the spokesman is referring to being
lockstep with Taiwan on defense—not lockstep

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,620
with our European allies on their China investment
deal.

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,510
Which brings us to Gina Raimondo.

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,480
She’s Biden’s pick for Commerce Secretary.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,700
She’s spoken about protecting US telecom
networks from Chinese companies.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,580
But in her nomination speech, she didn’t
say whether or not the Biden administration

41
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,140
would keep Chinese telecom Huawei on a blacklist.

42
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,720
The US has been calling Huawei a national
security threat since the Obama Administration.

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,900
But the Trump Administration went further
by actually putting Huawei on a trade blacklist.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Now, House Republicans, led by Michael McCaul,
the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,420
Committee, want to delay Raimondo’s confirmation,
until the administration makes its Huawei

46
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
stance clear.\h

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,590
“The fact that the Biden Administration
has still refused to commit to keeping Huawei

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,290
on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List
is incredibly alarming and dangerous.”

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,861
So they want to, “place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s
confirmation until the Biden Administration

50
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:56,080
clarifies their intentions for Huawei and
on export control policies for a country that

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,100
is carrying out genocide and threatening our
national security.”

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,430
It is kind of hard to say I really want to
do business with a country that’s committing

53
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,430
genocide.

54
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:13,400
Of course, not all countries have problems
doing business with those committing genocide.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Like Myanmar!

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,820
I’ll tell you more after the break.

57
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,169
Welcome back.

58
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:26,580
Myanmar has billions of dollars of investment
deals going with the Chinese Communist regime.

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,490
Myanmar also had a military coup this week.\h

60
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,620
China has blocked the UN from condemning the
coup.

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,389
And if the US isn’t careful, it could push
Myanmar closer to China

62
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,210
For more on the Myanmar Coup, and what it
means for the Biden Administration’s attempts

63
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,659
to deal with China, check out yesterday’s
episode on America Uncovered.

64
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:54,860
According to Reuters, Chinese hackers may
have exploited a bug in SolarWinds software

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,780
to spy on a US federal payroll agency.

66
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,990
Don’t worry.

67
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,710
“The software flaw exploited by the suspected
Chinese group is separate from the one the

68
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,759
United States has accused Russian government
operatives of using,” to compromise sensitive

69
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,539
federal agencies.

70
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,189
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

71
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:20,139
Two hostile authoritarian regimes were able
to separately break into SolarWinds?

72
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,460
I’d actually feel better if they had to
work together to crack it.\h

73
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,010
Like some kind of terrible sequel to Hackers
where Russia is played by Steven Seagal and

74
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,060
China is played by Jackie Chan.

75
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,180
Now to Hong Kong refugees.

76
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,930
Which is now pretty much anyone in Hong Kong
looking to escape the long arm of Beijing.\h

77
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,979
The new Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
has suggested the US could give them sanctuary.

78
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,470
In an interview with MSNBC, Blinken said,
“We see people who are, again, in Hong Kong

79
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,669
standing up for their own rights, the rights
that they felt were guaranteed to them.\h

80
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,370
And if… they’re the victims of repression
from Chinese authorities, we should do something

81
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,249
to give them haven.”

82
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,770
Back in December, there was a bill that would
grant temporary refuge to Hong Kongers.

83
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,210
It unanimously passed in the House, but was
blocked in the Senate by...Ted Cruz.

84
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,350
He worried there weren’t safeguards in place
to prevent Chinese spies from sneaking in

85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,380
as well.

86
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,889
Meanwhile, the UK is offering Hong Kong residents
a route to citizenship.

87
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,770
Hong Kong residents can apply for a British
National Overseas passport, or BNO.

88
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,389
In response, China said it would no longer
recognize BNOs.

89
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:46,479
Speaking of the UK, the UK has revoked the
license of Chinese state-owned broadcaster

90
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,770
CGTN, which is the English version of China
Central Television.

91
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:57,870
It comes after the media regulator Ofcom “concluded
that the news channel was ultimately controlled

92
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,439
by the ruling Communist Party of China.”

93
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,150
I could have told them that years ago.

94
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,240
But better late than never.

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,039
It also comes after Ofcom ruled that “CGTN
repeatedly breached impartiality standards

96
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,809
with its coverage of protests last year in
Hong Kong.”

97
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:23,490
And it *also* comes after a complaint by Peter
Humphrey, a UK citizen who was forced to give

98
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,759
a confession while in a Chinese prison.

99
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:35,270
CGTN then broadcast that forced confession
on its channel in the UK, which was illegal.

100
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,249
We had Humphrey on our podcast a few months
ago.

101
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,000
Check that out for more.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,060
You may remember in a recent episode I talked
about Lai Xiaomin, China’s most corrupt

103
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,879
official.

104
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:56,289
He was caught with 3 metric tons of cash that
came from bribes, as well as 100 mistresses.

105
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,229
And now, he has been executed.

106
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,539
For the bribes.

107
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,729
Not for the mistresses.

108
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,719
Jack Ma—one of China’s richest men.

109
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:11,059
He mysteriously disappeared back in October,
and reappeared in January.

110
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,069
But his troubles are just beginning.

111
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:20,449
First, Chinese state-run media left his name
off a list of entrepreneurial leaders.

112
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:27,279
And now his company Ant Group is being forcibly
restructured by Chinese regulators.

113
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,469
Those are the same regulators Ma criticized
back in October.

114
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,020
Before disappearing for months.

115
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,839
And the increased pressure is now causing
Chinese tech companies to turn on each other.

116
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,089
Two of China’s biggest tech companies are
in a lawsuit.

117
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:50,940
Douyin the company that owns TikTok, is suing
Tencent as the government launches an antitrust

118
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,220
crackdown on China’s tech industry.

119
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,899
China is also stockpiling computer chips in
response to a US ban.

120
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:04,580
And in the midst of all this, Apple is starting
to move production out of China.

121
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,300
I do hope the iPhone 13 comes with less slave
labor.

122
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,579
Also this week, I want to give a big thank
you to Australian Senator Eric Abetz for mentioning

123
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:22,529
China Uncensored in the Australian Parliament
after we had him on the show last month.

124
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:28,190
“China Uncensored, a YouTube program from
the United States.”

125
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,420
Also, I guess, thank you for your many years
of courageously standing up to the CCP.

126
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,570
But mainly, thank you for name dropping China
Uncensored in Parliament.

127
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,980
Does this mean that China Uncensored is now
in the official parliamentary record?\h

128
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,110
Despite all the chaos in the world, the Chinese
Communist Party hasn’t forgotten its core

129
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,379
mission: persecuting Chinese people.

130
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,290
\h
In the past three years, 50 people have been

131
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,899
sent to jail for using Twitter.

132
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,519
But there are bigger problems.

133
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,880
Chinese millennials aren’t getting married.

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,319
So obviously, the solution is boosting masculinity
with PE classes!

135
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:16,130
Surely this won’t become some insane new
government policy that overzealous local officials

136
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,319
take to an extreme.

137
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:23,720
But China’s top advisory body, the CPPCC,
is worried.

138
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,500
They say “Boys...have become too delicate,
timid and effeminate after being schooled

139
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,240
mostly by women teachers.”

140
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,880
And so, “Some affluent parents, worried
that their sons are too fragile, are sending

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,220
them to private boot camps that promise to
turn them into ‘real’ men through army-style

142
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,420
drills.”

143
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,959
In other words, a new generation of soldiers
for the US China Cold War.

144
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,110
And we end where we began.

145
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,041
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you, a fan who supports China

146
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,069
Uncensored through the crowd funding website
Patreon!

147
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:08,399
Tommy Hoover asks, “Yall should play socialism
monopoly again..

148
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,579
It was hilarious we watched the whole thing
lol”

149
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:17,230
Ah, Tommy is talking about a recent episode
of our podcast, China Unscripted.

150
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,069
We play the very real game—Monopoly Socialism.

151
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,800
It was a lot of fun for us.

152
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,779
But this reminds me of an idea I had for a
new show, one where Matt, Shelley, and I talk

153
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,120
about news and politics while playing through
video games.

154
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,200
It could be a fun way to get people into some
topics that might be a little dry or too serious

155
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,920
on their own.

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,009
But I’d love to hear what you think about
that\h idea.

157
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,110
Does that sound like a show you’d watch?

158
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,579
Let me know in the comments below.

159
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:47,579
Thanks for your question Tommy.

160
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,860
And thank you for watching.

161
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,940
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.
