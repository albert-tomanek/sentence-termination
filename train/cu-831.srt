1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,420
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,220
how to construct a giant mountain

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,520
out of a molehill.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,960
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,850
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,019
All the Chinese Communist Party wanted

7
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,640
was for the world to look on in admiration

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,400
at the once-every-five-years Party Congress.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,619
Nothing like a fake election

10
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:22,949
to trick the world into thinking

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,420
you have democracy.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Of course, to do that,

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,050
the Communist Party needed to make sure

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,119
all the world’s attention on China

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,769
was positive.

16
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,920
So they’ve done things like

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,910
shut down factories near Beijing

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,050
to ensure blue skies.

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,940
They restricted chemical transport along the
Yangtze River

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,789
to avoid the risk of an embarrassing environmental
disaster.

21
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,050
They even hired a bunch of grandmothers

22
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,620
to publicly shame people

23
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,660
into behaving better during the congress.

24
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,640
Yes, Big Granny is watching you.

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,480
What I’m saying is,

26
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,719
they’ve basically put the whole country
in lockdown.

27
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,860
So as long as nothing happened that would,

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,060
I don’t know,

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,140
draw a giant spotlight on the Communist Party’s

30
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,380
heavy-handed authoritarianism,

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,050
everything would be fine.

32
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,240
As long as they don’t do something stupid,

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,060
ike create a major international incident
in Hong Kong...

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,180
Ah, shoot.

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,780
I mean, shoot for the CCP.

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,480
I thrive when the CCP does stupid things.

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,760
And honestly,

38
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,530
it’s amazing how badly the CCP

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,010
bungled Hong Kong last week.

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,810
It all has to do with this man,

41
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,580
British activist and friend of the show

42
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,240
Benedict Rogers.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,050
You see, he’s been particularly vocal

44
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,400
about all the bad stuff the Chinese regime

45
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,220
is trying to do in Hong Kong.

46
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,300
Things like sentencing student activists to
jail time.

47
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,600
Or purging democratically elected officials.

48
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,050
So when Rogers was planning a trip

49
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,700
to Hong Kong in October,

50
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,430
he started getting threatening messages

51
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,270
from the Chinese Embassy in the UK,

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,860
and a warning that he would be denied entry.

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Okay, threatening a British citizen.

54
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,970
Surprisingly, it backfired.

55
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,960
Rogers flew to Hong Kong anyway.

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,840
But he didn’t make it out of the Hong Kong
airport.

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,479
He was stopped by security,

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,130
and then deported without being given any
reason.

59
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,500
And remember how the Communist Party

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,160
wanted to make sure absolutely nothing went
wrong

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,090
during the Party Congress?

62
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,230
Well, cue international backlash.

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,360
From the media...

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,850
and from the UK government.

65
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,630
“Ben Rogers is an outstanding and articulate

66
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,330
champion of freedom, democracy,

67
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,090
human rights and the rule of law

68
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,630
in Asia and elsewhere,

69
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,630
well known to members

70
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,030
on both sides of the house,

71
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,560
and his treatment was frankly utterly scandalous.

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,460
Those responsible have certainly not heard
the last of it,

73
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,820
of that I think we can be sure.”

74
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,860
Oops!

75
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,800
And while Chinese officials are used to

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,990
inviting dissidents “to tea,”

77
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,950
i.e. summoning them to have a stern talk...

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,460
This time the UK said to the Chinese ambassador,

79
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,069
“Your tea time’s got nothing on us.

80
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,230
Can I offer you a scone with clotted cream?”

81
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,400
And then 12 international lawyers wrote a
letter

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
about how Hong Kong’s rule of law

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,590
is under threat.

84
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,010
Quick, the CCP needs a distraction.

85
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,150
So, does anyone want to watch

86
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,790
a three and half hour speech

87
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,760
about national rejuvenation?

88
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,140
Whoa, sorry.

89
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,370
I think I was having a Chinese dream.

90
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,460
Back to Benedict Rogers.

91
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,130
He’s decided that in the wake of all this,

92
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,350
he wants to set up an NGO in London

93
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,380
geared toward influencing policy-makers

94
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,450
on Hong Kong issues.

95
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,090
If only the CCP had literally done nothing—

96
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,680
and just let Rogers just visit his friends
in Hong Kong

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,230
and then leave again—

98
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,410
none of this would have happened.

99
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,080
But it’s too late for making smart decisions.

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,530
Now, it’s damage-control time.

101
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,700
State-run media,

102
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,319
give us your spin!

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,980
Ha HA!

104
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,060
Decolonization in action!

105
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,850
Yes, this wasn’t about eroding the freedoms
of Hong Kong.

106
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,300
It was about decolonizing Hong Kong from the
evil British.

107
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,800
Any country that would try to exert control
over Hong Kong is evil!

108
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,020
Uh...as long as that country is Great Britain
and not China.

109
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,830
Maybe Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam
can explain

110
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,340
why the decision to deny entry to Rogers

111
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,130
was totally legit.

112
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,740
“Immigration matters under the Basic Law

113
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,300
are Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy.

114
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,960
But if immigration matters

115
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,780
become matters of foreign affairs,

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,280
then under Basic Law,

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,410
foreign affairs like defense are matters

118
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,300
for the Central People’s Government.”

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,650
So Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy,

120
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,960
and immigration matters are managed independently

121
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
by Hong Kong....

122
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,160
except when the CCP wants to control them
directly,

123
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,821
which it can do because Hong Kong

124
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,580
has a limited degree of autonomy?

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,340
It’s almost like she can’t get the story
straight,

126
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,410
because there is no independent rule of law

127
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,430
in Hong Kong anymore

128
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,820
and decisions are arbitrarily made.

129
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,419
Okay, let’s try someone else.

130
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,600
Maybe Lawrence Ma,

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,860
a pro-Beijing barrister in Hong Kong,

132
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,919
can get us out of this train wreck.

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,950
He knows how the law works!

134
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,850
He explains that Hong Kong has the rule of
law,

135
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,600
and its immigration isn’t just subject

136
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,550
to the whims of Beijing.

137
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,020
He gives an example.

138
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,080
“We have denied entry for people

139
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,540
who come in for political purposes—

140
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,370
for example, in 2006,

141
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,900
a bunch of Falun Gong organisers from Taiwan

142
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,600
wanted to come in for a conference

143
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,380
for cultural purposes—

144
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
and we have refused entry.”

145
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,500
That’s just more proof of what Beijing is
doing.

146
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,120
That’s the opposite of the point you wanted
to make!

147
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,390
Forget it, let’s go back to Carrie Lam.

148
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,830
Is there anything you can say to put out the
fire?

149
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,000
“So you certainly can’t exclude the possibility

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,230
that Chris Patten could be denied entry on
a future visit.”

151
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,720
“Well I can’t exclude any possibility

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,240
because immigration matters will change

153
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,210
depending on the case.”

154
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,210
You just said,

155
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,160
that Hong Kong could potentially kick out

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,600
even the last British governor of Hong Kong

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,220
if he tried to visit.

158
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,600
Cue international media backlash.

159
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, certainly this hasn’t come back to
bite anyone.

160
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,770
As this editorial from the South China Morning
Post says,

161
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,140
“If we really want to make world news,

162
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,020
let’s ban Chris Patten.

163
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,699
Had Benedict Rogers been allowed in,

164
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,419
he would have visited the jailed Occupy youngsters,

165
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,949
criticised the authorities and not attracted
global media attention.”

166
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,610
But hey everyone,

167
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,620
the Chinese company Tencent has made a mobile
game

168
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,000
that lets you clap for Xi Jinping’s speeches!

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,180
Surely that will distract you!

170
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,830
So what do you think about the Party’s

171
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,840
bungled attempts to smooth things over

172
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,760
for the 19th Party Congress?

173
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,110
Leave your comments below.

174
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,400
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

175
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,460
see you next time.

176
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,220
You know it’s hard to keep track of

177
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,580
how many times the Chinese Communist Party

178
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,729
has bungled its international image.

179
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,250
Wait, no it’s not!

180
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,600
You can just visit China Uncensored.tv

181
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,340
where we upload full half hour episodes of
the show

182
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,350
every Friday,

183
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,390
and get the complete rundown.

184
