1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,160
Protesters and police clash in Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,580
Meanwhile, Carrie Lam wants “dialogue”

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,000
With protesters Beijing is calling Despicable.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,280
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,820
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,130
It’s been another intense week in Hong Kong.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,330
Protests have gone on for over 100 days.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,150
And experts say if you can do a thing for
two months,

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,330
it becomes a habit—

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,141
so I guess this is just what Hong Kong

11
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,189
is going to be like from now on.

12
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,350
Unless the Chinese regime comes in to help
them form a new habit.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,530
Anyway, this past weekend,

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,260
hundreds of thousands of protesters took to
the streets

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,780
despite the fact that police had banned those
protests.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,020
And the police once again used

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,469
one of the newest weapons in their arsenal—

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,329
one with a colorful twist:

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,600
Spraying people with blue dye.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
This way, the protesters

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
can be easily identified by the police.

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,720
And Gargamel.

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,180
So you do not want to be in the splash zone.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,739
Just like at a Gallagher show.

25
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,400
That’s a current reference, right?

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
And like Gallagher,

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,639
the Hong Kong protesters are truly despicable.

28
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,840
At least according to the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,929
For clarity, that’s what they’re saying
about the protesters,

30
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:13,929
not Gallagher.

31
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,539
I’m not sure what their opinion of Gallagher
is.

32
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,039
Anyway, roll clip.

33
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:22,099
“I just want to say that those people

34
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,700
who went to the British Consulate General
in Hong Kong

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,409
and requested for the rights of citizenship
and qualification,

36
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,579
I wondered if they can still be called the
real Chinese people.

37
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,609
For a Chinese person to beg a foreign government

38
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,380
to interfere is really despicable.

39
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,240
It's definitely not something you can be proud
of.”

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,209
Wait, does this mean Hong Kongers

41
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,590
don’t have to be called Chinese people anymore,

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,229
and can have their own identity as Hong Kongers?

43
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,229
No, that’s not the point of her insult.

44
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,529
Which is a shame,

45
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,829
because October 1st is China’s National
Day.

46
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,289
That’s the day that celebrates

47
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,529
the Communist takeover of China.

48
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:01,119
And in a move that will really punish Hong
Kong,

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,209
they’re cancelling the fireworks display.

50
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,999
“China's National Day is often marked with
elaborate fireworks.

51
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,450
But that's not the case in Hong Kong this
year,

52
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,900
with the government cancelling the display—

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,540
citing concerns over ‘public safety.’”

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,740
Don’t worry,

55
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,819
Hong Kong is going to see plenty of fireworks
on October 1st.

56
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,890
Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie
Lam

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,890
continues to turn a deaf ear to protesters’
demands.

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,819
Instead, she’s doubling down on her defense
of Hong Kong police.

59
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,269
But just because she’s completely ignoring
protesters,

60
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,739
doesn’t mean she’s not willing to listen.

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,489
She’s planning to host public dialogues

62
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,290
as part of a new style of people-oriented
governance.

63
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,470
And it’s totally not a gimmick.

64
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,280
“We are going into a new style governance,

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,849
that is more open and more people oriented...

66
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,780
I can assure you that this is

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,930
not the sort of one-off gimmick type of function

68
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,560
it is intended to be a very organised,

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,910
on a very sustainable,

70
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,760
and perhaps long-term basis.”

71
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,499
Of course, saying it’s not a gimmick

72
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:12,020
fills people with confidence that it’s really
not a gimmick.

73
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,549
Each session will have 200 hundred “randomly”
selected citizens.

74
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:19,730
But pro-democracy Hong Kong Legislator Tanya
Chan

75
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,319
says protesters already have been as clear
as possible.

76
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,709
“I don't see any kind of meaningful reasons

77
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,079
to have a dialogue with Mrs Carrie Lam.

78
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,129
I mean all our demands are so clear from the
very beginning

79
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,549
and she knows it very well,

80
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,950
and if she keeps on telling us

81
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,530
that (there will be) no commission of inquiry,

82
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,370
no universal suffrage,

83
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,189
then I think that is the end of it.

84
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,659
So, it is not fruitful to meet her at all.”

85
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,250
Now, meeting with US legislators,

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,849
that might be fruitful.

87
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,269
On September 17, Hong Kong activists,

88
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,209
including people I’ve interviewed on the
show

89
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,180
like Joshua Wong and Denise Ho,

90
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,749
asked US lawmakers for help in their fight
for freedom.

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,349
“The movement is far from over

92
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,500
because it has long moved beyond one bill
or one person.

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,660
Our most important demand is general in Hong
Kong,

94
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,090
which means free election.

95
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,729
Our government's lack of representation

96
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,099
lies at the heart of the matter.”

97
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,210
“It is a global fight.

98
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,970
We are on the frontlines of this global fight

99
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,730
to protect these universal values that we
all cherish.”

100
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,030
In fact, the Hong Kong protesters are such
a global fight,

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,120
they’ve managed to bring together

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,750
the most hated of opponents known to man:

103
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,680
soccer hooligans.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,139
On Wednesday,

105
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,580
hundreds of soccer fans from opposing teams
protested together,

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,330
defying everything we’ve come to know of
soccer fans.

107
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,280
“You know, we are fans of different football
clubs,

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,910
and usually we are enemy on the field during
the match.

109
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,160
But in such situation in Hong Kong now,

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,479
even enemy become friends;

111
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,979
we united because we also fight for freedom,

112
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,260
we ask for a better Hong Kong,

113
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,810
that's why we are here today.”

114
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,410
And yet despite that positive sign of unity,

115
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,250
credit rating agency Moody’s has downgraded

116
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,310
Hong Kong’s outlook to negative.

117
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,470
Is it because of those no-good despicable

118
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,090
Hong Kong protesters?

119
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,210
No, actually.

120
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,790
It’s more likely because the Chinese government’s

121
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,259
growing control over Hong Kong

122
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,150
makes it a less attractive place to do business.

123
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,880
Which is crazy talk, according to Carrie Lam.

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,139
“To change outlook of Hong Kong's rating
from stable to negative

125
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,690
of course it's something we find disappointing

126
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,600
and we do not concur,

127
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,120
especially if the justification for that sort
of change in outlook

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,470
was premised on whether we are still upholding

129
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,229
‘on country, two systems.’”

130
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,000
And yet Moody’s didn’t listen!

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,620
Poor Carrie Lam.

132
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,629
Can you imagine what it feels like when people
don’t listen to you?

133
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,530
But for those of you watching around the world,

134
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,020
you can now take a piece of the Hong Kong
protests

135
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,449
home with you—

136
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,690
with Hong Kong protester action figures!

137
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,370
“Actually, let's put in this way.

138
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,530
By making these toys,

139
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,050
we capture protesters in different forms during
the protests.

140
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,490
We have demonstrators, or protesters, of different
ages,

141
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,590
and you can see that they wear different apparel.

142
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,009
We are trying to capture their way of dressing.”

143
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,400
I hope that means someday

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,380
there’ll be a Chris Chappell action figure.

145
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,930
At least...two people would buy it.

146
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,020
What’s that, Shelley?

147
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Fine.

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,610
One person would buy it.

149
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,640
And now it’s time for me to answer

150
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,889
a question from one of you,

151
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,340
a fan who supports us through Patreon—

152
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,830
which I might remind you is critical to our
continued coverage,

153
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,870
since YouTube demonetizes most of our Hong
Kong episodes.

154
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,379
Paul Niu asks,

155
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,360
“Why can't the neighbouring countries

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,099
do the same thing in return but on a bigger
scale

157
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,409
That’s in reference to our recent episode

158
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:17,819
about China’s Maritime Militia.

159
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,070
Be sure to check it out.

160
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,139
Basically, the Communist Party has a more
or less civilian fleet

161
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,759
that’s tied to the Chinese military.

162
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,400
It uses this fleet to harass other countries’
ships.

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
The idea is,

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,620
it’s a way for China to bully other countries

165
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,840
without getting their military directly involved,

166
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,030
but if other countries retaliate,

167
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,289
then China will send in the military saying
they were provoked.

168
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,169
It’s a kind of evil genius—

169
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,919
the Communist Party’s favorite kind of genius.

170
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,540
So why don’t other countries do the same
thing?

171
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,729
Well, the primary victims are other southeast
Asian nations,

172
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,400
countries that don’t have the kind of military
power

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,389
China does to back up that kind of threat.

174
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,629
The reason this works from China is no one

175
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,300
wants to actually get into a war with China.

176
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,530
So China can push the envelope way further
than any other country.

177
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,639
Of course, the risk is someday
