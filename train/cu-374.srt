1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,690
prostitution and gambling?!

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,220
Now that's an investment!

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,360
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,289
You know, people love a good story.

7
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,290
And there are really only a handful of stories

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,779
that get told over and over again.

9
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,210
Boy meets girl,

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,160
hero goes on a quest,

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,990
Chinese Communist Party buries a country in
a debt trap.

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,699
Yeah, that last one never gets old.

13
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,960
In fact, it's being repeated once again in
Cambodia.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,380
Chinese investment is everywhere.

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,750
Because Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen
loves Chinese investment.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,711
Hun Sen used to a member of the Khmer Rouge--

17
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,130
the communist regime that killed millions
of Cambodians in the 1970s.

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,190
But don't worry, he left the Khmer Rouge...

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,690
to avoid being purged.

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,570
And then he became prime minister of Cambodia.

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,150
For the next 33 years.

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,890
Now after leaving the Khmer Rouge,

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,000
he had once called China "the root of everything
evil."

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,430
But you know, after being dictator of Cambodia
for three decades,

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,920
and forcing the supreme court to dissolve
the main opposition party,

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,210
...and winning a sham election again and again,

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,980
...your attitude toward the Chinese Communist
Party changes a bit.

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,040
Sure, they supported the Khmer Rouge that
literally killed

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,200
a quarter of your fellow countrymen in the
70s,

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,030
but now the Chinese Communist Party wants
to support you!

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,100
Water under the bridge!

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,810
Bodies under the floorboards!

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,780
Because the Chinese regime is supporting Hun
Sen with a lot of money.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,280
Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in
southeast Asia.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,890
They struggle with basic power and sanitation
issues.

36
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,590
But in just four years,

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,890
China had invested over 5 billion dollars
in Cambodia.

38
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,600
That's more money than Cambodia's own government

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,460
invested in the country during that time.

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,880
The Chinese Communist Party even pledged 100
million dollars in military aid.

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,820
All this is tied to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's
Belt and Road Initiative,

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,900
a trillion-dollar project with the goal of

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,259
connecting countries around the world with
China.

44
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,249
Now all that sounds good, right?

45
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:13,739
Well, it's kind of like how the McRib sounds
good.

46
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,230
Looks delicious right?

47
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,689
Until you go just beneath the surface and
realize that bun

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,610
is made out of the same stuff they use to
make yoga mats.

49
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,950
And yet, even though Chinese investment is
a giant multibillion dollar McRib,

50
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,879
authoritarian dictators can't help but say,
"I'm lovin' it."

51
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,859
So to look into China's McRib in Cambodia,

52
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,819
we hired a local to shoot some footage for
us

53
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,900
in the sleepy seaside town of Sihanoukville.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,040
Well, it's not so sleepy anymore.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,420
Chinese investment has been flooding in,

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,590
in the form of skyscrapers, bridges, hotels,

57
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,290
casinos, restaurants and apartment blocks.

58
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,790
Construction is going on 24/7.

59
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,730
China has pumped in over a billion dollars
here.

60
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,849
A joint-country economic zone has been set
up

61
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,569
that has brought in hundreds of Chinese companies,

62
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,890
some owned by the Chinese government.

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,790
The southern coast of Cambodia is now home
to more than four billion

64
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,779
dollars worth of Chinese power plants and
offshore oil operations.

65
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:15,790
Sihanoukville is also becoming a lynchpin
for China's Belt and Road Initiative.

66
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,829
A new highway will connect the city to China's
vast global trade network.

67
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,079
Not only that, in June, a one billion dollar
joint venture between

68
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,080
a Chinese-Malaysian company was announced
that will create a massive resort,

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,610
complete with water parks, hotels, and even
more casinos and malls.

70
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,180
Ha, sounds like a knock off Disney World.

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,040
What are they going to call it, Wisney World?

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,689
Haha, what's that Shelley?

73
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,749
Are you kidding me?!

74
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,180
That is what they're calling it?!

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,400
Well, I guess it will be the wappiest place
on Earth.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,060
Now obviously, all this investment has brought
some benefits.

77
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,749
And "Cambodian workers on Chinese construction
sites

78
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:58,309
earn three times what they used to on local
projects."

79
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:01,189
But no matter how good this McRib looks from
the outside,

80
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,319
on the inside it's still made out of yoga
mats.

81
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,730
The same story that has played out in countries
may be replaying here.

82
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,829
Although the roads in Sihanoukville may not
have as many potholes as before,

83
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,849
now they're being used by Chinese nouveau
riche driving Mercedes.

84
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,269
Chinese nationals have flooded Sihanoukville--

85
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,180
rich business owners, as well as workers.

86
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,210
Chinese make up about 20% of the population
now.

87
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,190
And they don't mix much with the local Cambodians.

88
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,870
Many of the new jobs go to Chinese immigrants,

89
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,400
who are driving up housing and food prices,

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,669
which then drive out the local Cambodians.

91
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:43,990
Rooms that once went for 500 dollars a month
now cost 4500 dollars.

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,750
And all those casinos?

93
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,310
The Cambodians can't use them.

94
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,940
Because it's actually illegal for Cambodians
to gamble.

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,319
In fact, a Cambodian man recently won 130,000
dollars at a casino,

96
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,080
but the Chinese owner refused to pay him because
of the law.

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Although I'm sure if the Cambodian guy had
lost 130,000 dollars,

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,789
the Chinese casino owner might have been a
bit more flexible.

99
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,819
Anyway, all the gambling has brought some...

100
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,720
shall we say...less than legitimate business.

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Like prostitution.

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,340
And increasing crime.

103
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,600
And according to the regional governor,

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,069
it's "in part due to an influx of 'Chinese
mafia [who] disguise themselves

105
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,680
to commit various crimes and kidnap Chinese
investors [...]

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,199
causing insecurity in the province.'"

107
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,550
Now this isn't exactly making the locals very
happy.

108
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,660
In fact, ethnic tension is on the rise.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,180
I don't want to see the Chinese

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,400
do whatever they want in Sihanoukville

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,460
or the whole country of Cambodia.

112
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,120
Not only that, but they create crime.

113
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,840
They break into cars.

114
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,880
There are now Chinese thieves who steal in
Sihanoukville.

115
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,960
They are involved in the drug trade, in murders.

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,039
City authorities aren't capable of controlling
their criminal activity.

117
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,160
And guess what?

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,909
All this development in Sihanoukville

119
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:15,949
also includes a 99-year lease on a deep water
port nearby--

120
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,870
a port that could eventually be used by the
Chinese navy.

121
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,770
Wait, where have I heard that before?

122
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,509
Oh yeah.

123
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,509
Vietnam.

124
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,120
And Sri Lanka.

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,259
So if all of this sounds familiar, it should.

126
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,229
This is a pattern we see worldwide as the
Chinese Communist Party

127
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,449
comes in with their bags of money:

128
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,469
Promise big investment, build a bunch of things,

129
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:43,319
"oops it wrecked the local economy and now
you're deep in debt",

130
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,430
"no problem, hand it over to us, ok?"

131
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,060
But if the Chinese regime and Hun Sen aren't
careful in Cambodia,

132
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,470
it could actually backfire on them.

133
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,520
Sure, Prime Minister Hun Sen seems powerful
now,

134
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
Cambodia could one day see a situation like
Malaysia--

135
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,449
where a corrupt prime minister gets kicked
out in favor of

136
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,889
a new guy who rejects Chinese investment.

137
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,060
And that could have serious ramifications
for the future of the Belt and Road.

138
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
So what do you think?

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,659
Leave your comments below.

140
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:17,469
And now it's once again time for me to answer
a question from a fan

141
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:22,300
who supports China Uncensored on the crowd
funding website Patreon.

142
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,580
The GunSlinger has a question for the China
Uncensored crew:

143
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,469
"what hobbies do you have in your free time?

144
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,759
Any activities you do outside of your two
news channels?

145
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,300
Haha, free time.

146
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Between China Uncensored,

147
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,249
America Uncovered, the China Unscripted Podcast

148
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,229
and the America Uncovered podcast,

149
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,919
I don't have a whole lot of it.

150
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,400
But, with what little free time I do have,

151
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,039
I like learning more about China and its culture.

152
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,770
I meet friends at a traditional Chinese tea
house.

153
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,060
I read books about China.

154
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,180
I practice Chinese martial arts.

155
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,389
I also make steak.

156
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,370
Shelley, what do you do in your free time?

157
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,349
You kick butt and chew bubblegum?

158
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,689
And you're all out of gum?

159
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:05,879
Huh.

160
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,219
Thanks for your question.

161
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,690
