00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,310
Audience, are you ready?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,060
That’ll do, then, can we please have an
enormous round of applause for…

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,070
I’m not.

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,070
I’m not quite ready.

5
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,070

6
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,590
He’s popped out again.

7
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,330
My trousers aren’t quite where I want them.

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,600
Are they on you?

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,720
Yeah.

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Okay.

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,280
All of you?

12
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,680
Ankles count as on, right?

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
Yeah, close enough.

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,020

What are you d…?!

16
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,180
I wasn’t comfortable!

17
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,140
You do this every season.

18
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,580
Every season, I look round and
see you adjusting your personage!

19
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,760
I’m not adjusting…

20
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,260
I was adjusting my belt!

21
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,160
Can we please have a round of applause to
