1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,889
Hong Kong needs to be more “patriotic”

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,960
According to China’s Communist officials

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,570
Welcome to 
China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,679
The Chinese Communist Party is ordering Hong
Kong to be more patriotic.

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,009
But before we begin, YouTube is demonetizing
a lot of our videos, and they’re secretly

6
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,539
unsubscribing people.

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:34,129
You can help us stand up to censorship and
ensure you get notified of new episodes by

for as little as a dollar an episode.

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,940
Hong Kong has been embroiled in a pesky pro-democracy
movement the Chinese Communist Party just

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,859
can’t seem to crush.

11
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,370
Which is why the Communist Party is now saying
Hong Kong must be ruled by patriots.

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,690
Yes, beatings will continue until patriotism
is achieved.

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,940
The call for patriotism comes from Xia Baolong,
director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,229
Office.

15
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:07,170
Nice guy.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,650
Earlier this week he delivered a speech where
he said “Hong Kong should be governed by

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,650
‘patriots.’”

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,250
Now that might sound vague and...unnerving.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,000
After all, how can you tell who is a Patriot?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,409
Well, it’s really simple.

21
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,439
According to Erick Tsang, Secretary for Constitutional
and Mainland Affairs, “You cannot say that

22
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,570
you are patriotic but you do not love the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,229
or you do not respect it—this does not make
sense.

24
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,399
Patriotism is holistic love.”

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,799
Holistic love.

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,869
You love all of the Party.

27
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,630
From the honeyed face of Winnie the Pooh to
the ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang.

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,820
Makes sense.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,410
After all, the Communist Party believes love
is never having to say you’re sorry.

30
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,490
For killing people and taking their stuff.\h

31
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,430
This call for patriotism in Hong Kong actually
goes back to a speech made by former Chinese

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,250
leader Deng Xiaoping in 1984.

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,850
This is when he was trying to lay out the
One Country, Two Systems model the Chinese

34
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,270
Communist Party would eventually use...and
then when it was no longer convenient, totally

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,500
discard.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,940
Hey, broken promises are just a part of being
in love.

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,910
Deng Xiaoping said, “What is a patriot?

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,300
A patriot is one who respects the Chinese
nation, sincerely supports the motherland’s

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,500
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and
wishes not to impair Hong Kong's prosperity

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,280
and stability.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Those who meet these requirements are patriots,
whether they believe in capitalism or feudalism

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,220
or even slavery.”\h

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,950
Makes sense.

44
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,280
To love Chinese communism, you do have to
be okay with their weird combination of capitalism...feudalism...and

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,319
slavery.

46
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,850
That speech was in 1984.

47
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,590
Fast forward to today, and Hong Kong officials
may soon be forced to take a patriotic oath.

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,700
“Anyone who fails to take the oath—or
is deemed to have done so in an insincere

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,600
fashion—would be immediately disqualified
from office and banned from running in elections

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,030
for the next five years.”

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,320
All this talk of patriotism ties into major
changes coming to local elections in Hong

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,190
Kong, which I’ll get to in a bit.

53
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,930
But since we now know who is a patriot, how
do we know who is not a patriot?

54
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,700
More after the break.

55
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,560
Welcome back.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,290
So we know according to the Chinese Communist
Party, a patriot is someone who’s okay with

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,710
slavery and genocide.

58
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,090
So what are the characteristics of someone
who is not a patriot?

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,850
Well, lucky for us, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs
Office director Xia Baolong spelled it out

60
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,670
for us in his recent speech on patriotism.

61
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,940
So who is not a patriot?

62
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,490
Well, he says those are people who: “hysterically
attack the central government by various means;

63
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:15,370
publicly promote Hong Kong independence; beg
foreign countries to pressure and sanction

64
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,810
China and Hong Kong; violate Hong Kong’s
national security law; challenge the fundamental

65
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,979
system of the country; and refuse to accept
or deliberately distort Hong Kong’s constitutional

66
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:28,979
order.”

67
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,110
So...these 2 million people, not patriots.

68
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,849
Keep in mind, Hong Kong only has a population
of 7 million, so...the Communist Party might

69
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,710
have to look hard to find patriots.

70
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,460
Which is why the oath of office for district
council members is so important.

71
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,931
You see, the Chinese Communist Party never
let Hong Kongers directly vote for their chief

72
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:53,931
executive.

73
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:59,090
They don’t even let them vote for half of
the city’s Legislative Council.

74
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,569
And when Hong Kongers elect the wrong candidates
for the half they can vote for, the candidates

75
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,449
now get disqualified.

76
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,629
But there are still elections for district
councillors.

77
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:15,310
District councils are the equivalent of local
town councils, and they usually deal with

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,750
issues like “littering, rat problems, traffic
flow issues or minibus routes.”

79
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,780
Yes, it’s a glamorous job.

80
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,419
But district councils are the only completely
directly elected positions in Hong Kong.

81
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,940
Which is why they became hugely symbolic during
the protests in 2019.

82
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:44,060
In a November 2019 district council election,
pro-democracy candidates won 90% of the district

83
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,330
council seats.

84
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:52,080
The pro-democracy candidates gained control
of 17 out of the 18 district councils.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,740
Previously, all 18 had been controlled by
pro-Beijing officials.

86
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,569
It showed that the people of Hong Kong supported
the pro-democracy protesters.

87
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,020
And it was a huge embarrassment for Beijing.\h

88
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,749
And it was also significant because District
Councilors get to choose 117 members of the

89
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:15,340
1200 seat committee that elects Hong Kong’s
Chief Executive.

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,060
Now almost all those other seats are controlled
by Beijing allies, so there’s no way those

91
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,400
District Councilors could have a decisive
impact.\h

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,129
But the District Council gets a few seats
in Hong Kong’s legislature, too.

93
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:35,229
And that meant that for the first time ever
the pro-democracy camp had a chance to actually

94
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,680
win a majority in the legislature.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,949
That would give them actual power to stop,
or at least slow down, the Chinese Communist

96
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,690
Party’s encroachment over Hong Kong.

97
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,599
Which is why last year’s Legislative Council
elections were postponed.

98
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,060
It was not because of the coronavirus.

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,539
After those legislative elections were postponed,
the Chinese Communist Party forced out all

100
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,449
of the pro-democracy legislators.

101
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,909
That’ll stop them from trying to win elections.\h

102
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:08,520
And now that Beijing has taken care of Hong
Kong’s legislature, it’s time for Beijing

103
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,319
to disqualify district councillors, too.

104
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,469
And stop them from running in elections.

105
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,229
But maybe I’m being cynical.

106
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:21,349
Because Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam
says that the patriots-only rule is not meant

107
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,960
to exclude democrats from politics.\h

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,009
It’s only meant to exclude the unpatriotic
ones that do things like...believe in democracy.\h

109
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:38,350
So here’s what Xia Baolong’s speech suggests
to me: At the beginning of March, the Communist

110
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,569
Party will hold what it calls the Two Sessions.

111
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,529
That's an annual gathering of the Party’s
political elite.

112
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:51,949
China’s rubber stamp Congress will then...rubber
stamp any policy action the Party wants.\h

113
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,570
And I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s
some kind of further reform to make Hong Kong

114
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,699
even more “patriotic.”

115
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,189
It’s all part of the Party’s holistic
love.\h

116
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,520
And now it’s time for me to answer questions
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,709
Army, fans who support China Uncensored on
the crowd funding website Patreon.

118
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,219
Samy Fay asks, “Last weekend.

119
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,690
I went thru a lot of the Unscripted episodes.

120
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm loving these and among my favorites where
the ones in which you invited Joshua Philipp.

121
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
His historical background is fabulous.

122
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,059
I think another invite should be considered.

123
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,059
No?”

124
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,539
Samy, I’m glad you like the China Unscripted
podcast!

125
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,150
For those of you who aren’t familiar with
it, we’ve had loads of guests on.

126
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,330
But one of the stand outs was Joshua Philipp,
host of the show Crossroads.

127
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,790
He gave us a lot of really mind blowing information
about the history of Communism.

128
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,130
I’ll put a link to those two episodes below.

129
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,660
We had briefly talked to him about doing another
episode and rounding out the trilogy, but

130
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,530
we never moved forward with it.

131
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,350
So to all of you watching, would you like
to see that?\h

132
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,020
Thanks for that Samy!

133
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,650
