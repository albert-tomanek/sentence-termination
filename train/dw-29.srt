1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
How long does it take for the Earth to go around the sun?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,380
Well, a day.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,860
"Well--" Yeah? "Twenty-four hours." Twenty four hours?

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
What do you reckon, cuz?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,680
Isn't it twenty four hours?

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,740
Obviously a day, yes.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,860
A day, I hope.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,740
I know it takes, uh, ninety minutes for the space station to go around the earth

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,340
Three-hundred and sixty days.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,540
No, one day. Is it one day?

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,640
I don't know. What is it?

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,500
I say one year.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,400
I dunno, like a year.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,020
Uh, a year.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,100
One year.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,020
Twelve months.

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,160
Twelve months?

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,940
Three-hundred and sixty five

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Three-hundred and sixty-five

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,180
Three-hundred and sixty-five

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,380
Three-hundred and sixty-five

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,960
Three-hundred and sixty five days?

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,340
Yeah, I'd agree with that

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,840
Three-sixty five.

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,660
It's somewhere between that, it's not quite precise, is it?

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,160
Three-hundred and sixty-five and a bit days.

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,600
It's nearly three hundred and--it's three hundred and sixty five

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,120
Five and a quarter days.

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,540
Wait, the earth doesn't take one day to get around the sun.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,580
Takes about a year.
