1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,360
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,260
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,640
But, soft! What light through yonder Matthew breaks?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,320
Everybody's favourite...that's not light that's breaking through him(!)

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,220
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,100
Can I compare thee to a summer's day?

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,100
No.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,000
And the bounciest man on the Internet, Matt Gray.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,940
Hej hej YouTube!

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,660
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,080
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING].

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,020
And the special prize for particularly good answers, which is...

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,140
That is not my buzzer. That is my glass.

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,340
That really hurt!

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,160
--There you go, Tom.
--Thanks.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,460
The only way that would've been better is if you'd picked the buzzer up, trying to drink it,

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,760
and it went "parp"!

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
Aroogah! Biscuits for everyone.

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,680
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING].

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,320
And there's a special prize for particularly good answers, which is...

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,320
And today we are talking about the Shanghai Fugu Agreement.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,280
No, no, fugu.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,260
Fugu.

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,980
There you go. We'll take the biscuits.

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,780
Laws for preparing poisonous fish?

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,660
Ooh! I'll give you a point for poisonous fish, yes [DING].

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,820
Absolutely. Tell me about fugu.

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,540
I saw it on the Simpsons.

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,900
The thing is, so many people sat there watching are going 'Fugu!... Simpsons.'

30
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,560
"I don't care buddy, fugu me!" All that stuff.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
"Poison, poison, tasty fish."

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,320
Yeah, that is essentially it.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
It is a toxic fish that has to be really, really carefully prepared.

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,500
How many years of training do they need for that?

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,420
Many?

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
Some?

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
Until they get it right?

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,000
Gary gets the point. Three.

39
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,760
[DING]

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,840
"First, catch a puffer fish."

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,520
[SHICK]

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,640
"I've gone wrong."

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
You went, argh!

44
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,640
Aww...

45
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,960
What does fugu poison do to you, if it goes wrong?

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
It's paralytic isn't it?

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,080
--Neurotoxin 
--Yes

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,460
Yes, have a point [DING]. In fact both of you [DING]. It's a tetrodotoxin.

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,520
-- Ooh!
-- Ooh!

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
On the tip of my tongue, dear boy.

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
Poisons tetras?

52
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
It's got three of them.

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,560
Five of them?

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,680
It's what's known as a sodium channel blocker.

55
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,700
Of course(!)

56
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,280
Paralyses the muscles, while the victim stays fully conscious.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,380
What's the antidote?

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
There is none!

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,500
Point! [DING]

60
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
Absolutely right, there is none.

61
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,920
Aw, I thought it was going to be chips.

62
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,840
That'll be really handy, because fugu and chips were... no, it's not like nettles and dock leaves.

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,200
Mushy peas?

64
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
Pie and peas?

65
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,080
--Wouldn't it be great if it was something like...
--Get it down yer, you'll be fine.

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,660
Wouldn't it be great if it was something like that, that in Japanese cuisine, they just hadn't come across?

67
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,120
So an excellent antidote to puffer fish toxin...

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,420
is parkin.

69
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,020
Or something like that.

70
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
Mucky fat and bread.

71
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,160
Anyone who is not from Yorkshire, is now Googling the phrase 'mucky fat'.

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,700
Aww beaut...

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,880
And probably finding out some things they didn't want to know.

74
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,380
Yeah.

75
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,120
Mucky fat on toast.

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,600
Mucky...Toast?

77
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900
Ours just goes on bread.

78
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,660
Bit of salt and some onion.

79
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Normally salty enough.

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,900
Well, I know. A relative of mine,
I'll leave the person un-named,

81
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,560
for reasons of them being a relative of mine.

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,900
But maybe not from the local area. We'll just leave it as broad as that, right.

83
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,700
Was at a Yorkshire Day party, we were at.

84
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,280
Yorkshire Day, first of August, for the anniversary of the Battle of Minden. For those of you at home.

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,640
Which I know isn't in Yorkshire, but **** you, that's why.

86
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,680
We get the weather.

87
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,680
Erm... We were at a Yorkshire Day party. Mucky fat on bread was being handed round.

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,240
At which point, the person announced 'Oh! Pâté.'

89
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,660
Ah! No!...No.

90
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,560
At which point we all nodded slowly, whilst smiling.

91
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,140
As the person wolfed down three slices. And then we told them what mucky fat was. Which is beef dripping.

92
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,340
For those of you who don't know what beef dripping is, that's just beef fat, that's fell off beef.

93
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,460
With bits of beef in it.

94
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,880
It's the stuff that's melted off, when they're cooking it or doing anything...

95
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,920
It's "residue".

96
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,080
It is a residue.

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
Salty residue.

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,380
Tasty residue.

99
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,940
It is brown... i.e. mucky. And you just spread it on bread.

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,460
Or toast, should you wish your bread to be harder.

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,200
"Toast! For if you want your bread to be harder."

102
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,220
That's the marketing done for the next 20 years.

103
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,860
We've talked about condiments on toast before.
Let's move on.

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,560
There is now safe fugu.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,140
Puffer fish bred that don't have the toxin in them?

106
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,740
Yes. Absolutely. Well not necessarily bred.

107
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,600
Punched!

108
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Stop it!

109
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,580
Punch the toxin out of them.

110
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,480
Specially squose.

111
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,080
Before preparations...

112
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,960
Wring it out.

113
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,380
Persuaded.

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,520
"Oh, be nice."

115
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
"Don't have it in!"

116
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,780
Where does the toxin in the fugu come from?

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,320
It's like the skin and the fins or something?

118
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,540
--Gall bladder?
--Oh, no, the skin is usually non-poisonous.

119
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,440
It's the liver...also the ovaries and eyes. But mainly the liver.

120
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,260
The eyes?!

121
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,900
The eyes.

122
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh my god, it's got poisonous eyes.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
That's a bit dark.

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,620
Yeah.

125
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,460
But where does that come from?

126
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,660
Is it what it eats?

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
--Point!
--Ooooh!

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,760
[DING] Absolutely right. It's the food that it eats.

129
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,720
It's from other animals...
that have tetrodotoxin laden bacteria in them.

130
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,360
So it's eating the nerve poison.
Why doesn't it get poisoned?

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,160
Because it's got a very good...
liver-y excretory system.

132
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720
It's very, very hardcore.

133
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,580
You know what? I'm going to give you the point there [DING].

134
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,740
It develops immunity over time.

135
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,220
So initially is this fish a bit paralysed while it's eating all these bacteria laden toxins

136
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,480
that it's built up in its system?

137
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
I think you are also right that it's got a very strong system as well.

138
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,580
Yeah.

139
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,260
But it can just continue eating this stuff and it just absorbs it into itself, as it does with any chemical.

140
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,340
And it just, you know, pulls it out.
That's it. It's a toxic fish.

141
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,540
That's like when I was at school and there was that lad called John who just ate nettles.

142
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,360
Raw.

143
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,840
Go on...!

144
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,820
I've told the story.
There was a lad called John, who just ate...

145
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,340
He didn't just eat nettles. That wasn't his entire diet.

146
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,320
But he would eat nettles.

147
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,740
Why?

148
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,460
--I don't know?!
--Summat t'do, innit?

149
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,000
It was funny?

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,200
He maybe liked the sensation?

151
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,420
I think he might have...

152
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,180
What, the stung up tongue?!

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm not him!

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Why should I defend the man's weird mistakes in life?

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,920
I don't know. You might work with him. You might be in your office and come in one day, pop open his lunch box

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,300
and lo and behold, there's a bloody spitting adder and some nettles. He's gone on in life.

157
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,060
If you do work with someone called John. Ask them when you see them next. Did you eat nettles as a kid?

158
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,600
Because we might be able to track him down.

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,140
Well he's the one with the really swollen up lips,
I imagine!

160
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,880
So with those fish. Is there one that's... is it like humans? There's this one that's gluten intolerant?

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,700
Like we have. "Oh I can't eat that,
I'm tetrodotoxin intolerant."

162
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,260
Yes, because they are farming poison-free fugu

163
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,000
by keeping them away from those bacteria, keeping them in tanks.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,380
--"Oh sorry, I've got a specific diet."
--I was going to say...

165
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,720
[ENGINE NOISE]
Not that kind of tank!

166
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,280
That'd make them more, rather than less dangerous, wouldn't it?

167
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,360
Yeah!

168
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,540
We got some...

169
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,800
"Don't eat me!"

170
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,760
"Got some really deadly fish here."
"Oh why, has it got toxin...?"

171
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,840
--"No! It's got a 12 bore cannon!"
--"No, it's driving a tank!"

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,260
Underwater weapons.

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,600
But then, if you put poisonous ones in the tank. You couldn't even engage in hand to hand combat.

174
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,480
...you alright there?

175
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,760
I'm stuck in a tank.

176
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,520
Since 1958 chefs have to be licensed to prepare and sell fugu. Which takes about three years.

177
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,260
Licence to fugu!

178
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,400
What does the licensing involve?

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,560
Not killing the assessor.

180
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,200
"That was delicious, and I'm still breathing."

181
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,360
--No. The thing is...
--"Very well done."

182
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,200
Who eats the fish?

183
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,420
Themselves!

184
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,780
--Oh, him!
--Yes, have a point [DING].

185
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,760
That makes sense.

186
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
They eat their own fish.

187
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,940
So there is no-one on this earth who has failed the test?

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,360
And is a chef.

189
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,780
And is a chef. You're absolutely right.
Only about 35% actually pass.

190
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,680
-- What?
-- Because mild poisoning will mess you up

191
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,920
or it will be "oh, yeah, you've clearly got a small dose there, you're feeling ill." But it won't kill you.

192
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,020
--A small dose...
--So they've got near enough to their pound of flesh

193
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,680
--Yes.
--Which leaves you with a tingly mouth

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,380
--You've got about five...
--For a few days. Yeah.

195
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,080
Erm, but what are the parts of the test?

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
Catch your fugu fish.

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
Yes!

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,860
There's the making. But then there's the cleaning up afterwards. So you don't infect everything.

199
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,140
--Well that's a fair point.
--We've got preparing and eating.

200
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,340
But there's, before we even get to preparing and eating...

201
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,940
Identifying a fugu fish.

202
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,060
Correct!

203
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,060
[DING]

204
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,080
In fact...

205
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Because it literally says, 'a fish identification test'.

206
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,500
--That's cod.
--A fish.

207
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
That's a fish.

208
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,100
That's a beef. That's a fish.

209
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,840
So yes. That's your second one.

210
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,720
I mean, it kind of echoes the British driving test really.
Because that's your hazard perception.

211
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,920
And then you've got your practical.
What bit are we missing?

212
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,600
--Theory.
--Theory.

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,220
Point over there to Matt Gray [DING].
You also have a written theory test.

214
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,860
What happens if you feed fugu to someone, and you haven't done it properly?

215
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
"They are dead."

216
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Yes. How many people in Tokyo are hospitalised, every year roughly, through fugu...

217
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,640
Thirteen?

218
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,420
OK, we're clearly doing Price is Right rules here, aren't we? Thirteen.

219
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,220
I...I think it will be quite a high number.

220
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,240
Because I can see it being a bit like ordering a really stupidly hot curry.

221
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,900
You ask specifically for one that hasn't been neutralised. That isn't the neutral one.

222
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,420
--You ask specifially for a poisoned one.
--I bet there's a little thing.

223
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,700
I bet there's a thing with some people that they like to eat it a little bit of the toxin still in

224
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,400
So they get a little bit of a tingle, or something like that. So I think it's gonna be in...

225
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,340
s it every year, did you say?
--Per year, in total.

226
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,280
I reckon, less than a hundred, but not much less.

227
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,500
I think nine. Just 'cos  that was the number that popped into my head.

228
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,160
I'm going to give that to Gary. It's somewhere between about 35-65 each year, [DING]

229
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,200
--That's the order of magnitude then.
--Yeah.

230
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,040
And between 0 and 6 die.

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,600
S*** the bed.

232
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,340
What are some of the reasons you might get poisoned? Particularly if you've been prepared by an amateur.

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Eating the poison?

234
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
--Well yeah.
--He's good, he's good(!)

235
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,220
The lad's sharp(!)

236
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,480
Improper methods is in there.
But there's one other thing.

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,140
We've already covered it in the test.

238
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,720
Licking the knife.

239
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,540
Being served it incorrectly, by identifying the wrong fish?

240
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,960
Correct. They didn't think it was a fugu fish. [DING]

241
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,720
Does it look... It must look like a different fish.

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,680
It looks like a lot of other fish.

243
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Oh s***!

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,280
"Lovely sea bass...!" [SLOBBERS]

245
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,180
[SLURRING] This is a very piquant sauce.

246
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,840
Cod.

247
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,040
Death cod!

248
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,180
"Now remember I put the death cod on the left,
the good on the right."

249
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,440
"Remember, right for the death cod, left for the good cod."

250
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,400
"Right, left. Remember that!"

251
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,440
"Right? Good!" "Oh s***!"

252
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,520
And they're in the same type of pan!

253
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,160
All of which brings us back to the Shanghai Fugu Agreement. Which is 1985 in Germany.

254
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,440
Do they agree that they won't sell fugu in Europe?

255
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,680
Yeah, they won't export it.

256
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,760
That's not something you really agree on with people from Shanghai, is it?

257
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,040
We agree we are god-damn
not selling your killer fish, right!

258
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,940
This is the Green Party. Who are locked in a coalition agreement --

259
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,820
their very first ever coalition agreement --

260
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,740
with the Social Democrats, in one of the German states.

261
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,840
And they are going into coalition, and they put forward -- on the last day of negotiations

262
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,660
they demand that they sign the Shanghai Fugu Agreement.

263
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,240
And this is an agreement to help with what? What do you need to prepare fugu?

264
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,960
Knives!

265
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,720
Fugu!

266
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Chefs!

267
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,860
Yep. I'll give you a point there. You need chefs. [DING]

268
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,160
How do you get chefs to Germany?

269
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
On a train?

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,840
But what permissions do they need, to get in there?

271
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,560
A licence?

272
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,400
Visas?

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,480
Gary's got the point there again. [DING]

274
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,680
They need visas.

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,300
And so the Shanghai Fugu Agreement is a set of international regulations.

276
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,000
There's a special set of visas for certified fugu chefs.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,820
They demanded that was one of the things they should sign. What's the problem with that agreement?

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,080
It's wrong.

279
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,560
In what way?

280
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,200
--Shanghai?
--Yeah?

281
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,300
That's China isn't it?

282
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,460
Mm. That's one of the problems with it(!)

283
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,160
--That's one of quite a few.
--That's not where they eat it.

284
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,140
And -- it is, it's pan-Asian anyway. But it's not, you know...what it's famous for.

285
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,200
It's completely fake.

286
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,840
Aaaaw! What?!

287
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,100
The Greens had been in negotiations for days, were sick of the negotiations,

288
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,280
made up a completely fake agreement, and added it to the list of demands

289
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,620
and the minister they were arguing with, just went 'yes, OK, fine! Yep. Wonderful.'

290
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,380
I bet after that, they were kicking themselves, that they couldn't do something more fun than that.

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
No! No-one noticed.

292
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,040
They could have made everyone wear jelly on a Sunday.

293
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,060
The negotiators didn't notice,

294
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,920
The civil servants didn't notice.

295
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,820
They could have banned the apostrophe!
They could have done anything!

296
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,720
The press didn't notice.

297
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,480
It took years before someone went:

298
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,580
--"Oh yeah!"
--"What is that?"

299
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,080
"Remember when we did that?"

300
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,860
"We have made it so that no one called Keith may enter the country!"

301
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,200
You know, you could do that.

302
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,360
So did they draw up an agreement?

303
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,160
No. They just required that the Social Democrats be party to the Shanghai Fugu Agreement.

304
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,600
Completely faked.

305
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,560
Without having read it.

306
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,300
The fun you could have in that situation.

307
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,940
So congratulations, at the end of that,
Gary, you win this week's show. Well done!

308
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,320
You win a confederate general made out of interlocking stones without any mortar.

309
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
No!

310
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,280
--Yep! Got it!
--Go for it. Go for it. He's got it for once.

311
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,760
A Dry Stone-Wall Jackson!

312
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,980
Yes! He's got it!

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,560
With that, we say thank you to

314
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Chris Joel,

315
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,860
to Gary Brannan,

316
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,200
-- to Matt Gray...
-- Goodbye YouTube.

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,000
I've been Tom Scott. We'll see you next time.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,080
We are doing an experimental live show of this

319
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
with a live audience.

320
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,540
If you would like to be part of that,
then details are on screen now.

321
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,880
Close enough to touch!

322
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Don't... don't do that.

323
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,100
No touching.

324
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Would you like to see our faces in person and admire us at closer distance than this?

325
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,700
We're doing an experimental live show and you could be there should you wish to.

326
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,100
Do you want to see us in slightly lower resolution than on GoPro footage?

327
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,040
We'll be doing an experimental live show!

328
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,520
Do you want to see this before it's been edited down from 40 minutes into 10?

329
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,560
Well, we might be doing an experimental live show!

330
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
You can watch us, pre-editing(!)

331
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,740
I don't think you want to, really(!)

332
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,880
Do you like jokes that you really can't hear because they're libelous,

333
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,320
too rude, or frankly insulting?

334
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,100
Then feel free to watch us go harder and longer

335
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
in our experimental live show!

336
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,800
Do you want an hour of the post-credits sequence?

337
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,580
Come and see the experimental new live show!

338
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,200
Bear in mind, that we edit quite a lot out of this.

339
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,140

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,920
It's very important to stress
that the experimental live show

341
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,320
is not the kind of experimental live show you might see in Amsterdam.

342
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
That said, the live show is over-18 only because at some point

343
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,080
one of us is going to make a joke that could get us in trouble.

344
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
And we're all going to say **** at some point(!)

345
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,320
****, ****, willies and *******!
Come see Tech Dif Live!
