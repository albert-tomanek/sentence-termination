00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,640
Chris Joel!

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,100
Why am I rushing?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,640
-Ooh s***!
-Run! Run! Quicker! faster!

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,560
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm sorry, I'm just too…

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Oh, for f***...

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,480
Yay!

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,760
And the bounciest…

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,480
"The bounciest., 'Ra, ha...'"

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,480
It's Bob Fleming.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
-The i...
-I think throwing dogs into the sky

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,480
would work better.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That means the dogs will be further
away from me as well, so I'd be happy.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm not a dog person, I'm…

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,840
I killed that.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,000
-What year did I say earlier?
-2016 you said.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,320
-I think it was earlier, wasn't it?
-It was, I need to re-say that.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,840
Why might the Chinese have fired 1,000 rockets
into the evening sky in 2008?

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,680
That's fine, that will get put in later and it
won't look like I screwed that up at all.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,800
Only these people will know.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,840
Kill them.
