1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,100
The Chinese Military rotates troops into Hong
Kong.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,540
No protest for protesters.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,380
And who is the real hero of the Hong Kong
protests?

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,340
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,560
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,189
This week in China’s most politically embarrassing
city,

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,380
Hong Kong...

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,019
The Chinese People’s Liberation Army—or
PLA—

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,849
moved troops into Hong Kong

10
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,289
in the early hours of Thursday morning.

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,429
You know it’s true,

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,840
because Chinese state-run CCTV broadcast this
footage.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,230
But don’t worry!

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,540
It’s just a totally normal troop rotation.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,580
The PLA administers 19 sites in Hong Kong,

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,190
including 12 barracks.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,640
One of them is this giant PLA garrison in
downtown Hong Kong.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,530
It’s right next to Chief Executive Carrie
Lam’s office,

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,710
and the Legislative Council building.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,310
And every year at roughly this time,

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,500
the PLA *does* do a regular troop rotation.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,710
I mean, there’s only so long an individual
soldier

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,040
can stand being in Hong Kong.

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,750
He eventually needs to get some R&R

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,999
back in mainland China,

26
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,100
where he won’t be confused by the uncensored
Internet.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,520
Anyway, this year,

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,130
the troop rotation was heavily promoted on
CCTV.

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,979
And not just in a standard news report with
one cameraman.

30
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,579
Look at these cinematic tracking shots.

31
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,310
They definitely hired a drone or jib operator.

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,079
To subliminally hint that these troops are
a big deal.

33
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,229
But again, don’t worry.

34
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,539
Because it’s *no* big deal!

35
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,479
This was totally a normal troop rotation.

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,649
The fact that it’s also a blatant intimidation
tactic

37
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,960
is just a bonus, really.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,810
And frankly, who needs the PLA

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,859
when Hong Kong has its own capable police
force?

40
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:49,030
They’ve been firing tear gas and rubber
bullets.

41
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,719
Even threatening to use their handguns.

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,350
But they’ve also allegedly been sexually
assaulting

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,369
female Hong Kong protesters.

44
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,899
30,000 people came out on Wednesday night

45
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,850
to protest police sexual violence.

46
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,689
And they brought a familiar face with them.

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,180
I never thought I’d say this,

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,190
but Pepe looks almost...not creepy.

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,250
Ok, never mind.

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,700
According to a small survey last week,

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,980
23 women say they’ve been sexually abused

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,500
by the Hong Kong police since the protests
began in June.

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,810
“In one case, the police are accused of

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,590
completely stripping a woman demonstrator

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,760
during a search at a police station.

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,620
In another case, a video shows a half-naked
woman

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,920
being dragged away by policemen.”

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,079
Good thing Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie
Lam

59
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,629
is on the side of women.

60
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,980
What’s that, Shelley?

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,230
Oh, sorry, I mean police.

62
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,540
She’s on the side of the police.

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,950
In a leaked audio recording,

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,269
she told a group of young people on Monday

65
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,939
that she strongly opposes

66
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:49,890
any independent investigation into police
conduct.

67
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,540
In the recording originally published by Apple
Daily,

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,099
she said, “Many people want to investigate

69
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,040
the abuse of power of the police,

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,730
if they violated this-and-that [rule] during
operations,

71
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,329
so colleagues of the police force

72
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,530
were very much opposed to it.”

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,360
Lam went on to say that she couldn’t do
something “hastily”

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,430
that would affect the police’s work.

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,180
Well if the police don’t want to be investigated,

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,970
then case closed.

77
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,629
Good thing Carrie Lam’s own conduct

78
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,810
has also been successfully kept under wraps.

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,190
Well, except for this leaked audio.

80
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,340
Speaking of Carrie Lam,

81
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,930
she’s not going to step down.

82
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,200
“I think a responsible chief executive at
this point in time

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,439
should continue to hold the fort

84
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,969
and do her utmost to restore law and order
in Hong Kong.

85
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,150
And I wouldn't say that my government has
lost control.

86
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,629
Day in, day out,

87
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,470
we are not only supporting the law enforcement
bodies,

88
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,480
we are also acting responsibly to deal with
other issues.”

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,109
Yes, she’s acting very responsibly

90
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,349
by not meeting any of the protesters’ demands.

91
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,969
And guess who’s just been arrested in Hong
Kong?

92
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,219
Activists Joshua Wong,

93
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,829
Andy Chan, and Agnes Chow.

94
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,090
Now granted, they’re not actually protest
leaders—

95
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,989
since this movement doesn’t have any official
leadership,

96
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,689
and decisions seem to be made in big group
huddles,

97
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:14,019
or group chats on the instant messaging service
Telegram

98
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,190
and the online forum LIHKG.

99
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,850
But that shouldn’t stop authorities from
arresting people anyway.

100
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,259
And they have!

101
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,900
Police have arrested over 900 protesters so
far.

102
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,910
Wong and Chow, by the way, were arrested

103
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,800
for their “inciting and taking part in an
illegal assembly”

104
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,639
outside police headquarters on June 21—

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,520
the same event where Shelley and I did a live
broadcast from.

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,460
Of course, it could get worse.

107
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,620
Much worse.

108
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,080
Carrie Lam *could* use the “Nuclear Option.”

109
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,900
That’s the Emergency Regulations Ordinance
of 1922.

110
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,350
It says that in the “occasion of emergency
or public danger”,

111
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,220
the Hong Kong Chief Executive may

112
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,680
“make any regulations whatsoever

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,759
which he may consider desirable in the public
interest.”

114
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,190
He or she, I guess.

115
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,710
I mean, this regulation was made long before

116
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,400
anyone thought there could be a woman in charge.

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,670
But this law is surely not obsolete in any
other way.

118
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,889
So what could the Chief Executive do with

119
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,040
these dictator-like powers?

120
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,259
Well, it’s a pretty extensive list.

121
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,210
It includes: Complete media censorship;

122
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,240
Arrest, detention, and deportation;

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,190
Control of all the ports of entry;

124
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,340
The entry and search of premises;

125
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,580
And the confiscation of personal property.

126
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,009
Don’t worry, this Ordinance hasn’t been
used

127
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,510
since the anti-British riots of 1967.

128
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,780
And Hong Kongers love the British now.

129
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,470
At least compared to the People’s Republic
of China.

130
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,610
Speaking of rights being taken away:

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,860
the right to peaceably assemble.

132
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,490
The Civil Human Rights Front is the group
that organized

133
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,479
the 1-million person march on June 9th...

134
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,400
The 2-million person march on June 16th...

135
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,069
And the 1.7-million person rally on August
18th

136
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,190
that turned into a march

137
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,540
because not everyone could fit into the park.

138
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,710
Sure, all those events were peaceful.

139
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,690
But also, they’re very dangerous, according
to police.

140
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,580
That’s why the police banned

141
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,930
the rally and march scheduled for tomorrow—

142
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,509
Saturday the 31st.

143
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,819
It was going to honor the call for universal
suffrage

144
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,080
that kicked off the Umbrella Movement five
years ago.

145
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,169
So the Civil Human Rights Front canceled their
event,

146
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,000
and that’s that.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,669
Except that may not actually stop people

148
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,919
from coming out to protest.

149
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,100
Posters like this started appearing,

150
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,640
calling for people to come out and protest
anyway.

151
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,069
Who’s the organizer?

152
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,069
“Nobody”.

153
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,290
I have a feeling a lot of people are going
to show up.

154
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,129
Including well-armed police.

155
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,160
Speaking of well-armed police, there’s a
hero in this story.

156
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,520
Remember how I told you a few weeks ago

157
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,160
about a Hong Kong policeman

158
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,160
who waved his shotgun at protesters?

159
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,159
Well guess what?

160
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,159
Shotgun Cop—

161
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,970
whose name is Officer Lau, by the way—

162
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,440
has been invited to Beijing for the upcoming
celebrations

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,389
for the 70th anniversary of the People’s
Republic of China.

164
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,669
As my favorite state-run media The Global
Times put it,

165
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:07,979
“[Officer] Lau has become

166
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,500
an internet celebrity in the Chinese mainland

167
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,770
for his courage and high morale,

168
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,190
despite the biased coverage

169
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,460
by some Western and Hong Kong media.”

170
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,050
You’re right, Global Times.

171
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,820
Our coverage of him was totally biased.

172
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,909
Shotgun Cop *is* the hero.

173
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,190
He had no choice but to pull out a shotgun

174
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,599
to defend himself against protesters.

175
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
Sure, the protesters have no guns.

176
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,319
But they have heart.

177
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,530
And that’s a much more dangerous weapon.

178
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,970
And that’s it for the Hong Kong headlines.

179
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,479
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you,

180
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,720
a fan who supports us through Patreon—

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,040
which I might remind you is critical to our
continued coverage,

182
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,400
since YouTube demonetizes most of our Hong
Kong episodes.

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,110
Josiah Faber asks:

184
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,680
“What's Taiwan doing during hong kong?

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,669
Are they helping or remaining neutral?”

186
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,680
Good question, Josiah.

187
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,620
Taiwan as a country isn’t directly getting
involved in Hong Kong.

188
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,780
Well, unless you believe Chinese state-run
media

189
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,490
that Taiwan is one of the “black hands”
behind the protests.

190
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,389
But the Taiwan government *has* pledged

191
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,400
to help any Hong Kong protesters

192
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
seeking sanctuary on their island.

193
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Apparently, dozens of Hong Kong activists

194
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,600
have already fled to Taiwan.

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,460
One politician from the New Power Party

196
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,590
even shared a Facebook post calling for Taiwanese
people

197
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,750
to donate anti-tear gas equipment

198
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,599
and various supplies for Hong Kong protesters.

199
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,229
But that got her in hot water,

200
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,719
because then an opposing KMT politician

201
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,550
said her post violated the security law,

202
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,090
“which forbids Taiwanese from offering supplies

203
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,200
and aid to hostile countries,

204
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,430
including China’s special administrative
regions

205
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,040
of Hong Kong and Macau.”

206
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,960
The KMT politician went on to accuse

207
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,279
the New Power Party politician of “aiding
enemy forces”

208
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,180
and said he would report her to the police.

209
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,829
Wait a minute,

210
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:58,230
if this KMT guy thinks that the Hong Kong
protesters

211
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,630
are “enemy forces”

212
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,160
does that mean he supports the Chinese Communist
Party?

213
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,240
That means *he’s* the one who’s really
aiding enemy forces.

214
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Thanks for your question, Josiah.

215
