1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:02,889
President Trump’s State of the Union Address

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:05,620
singles out Chinese theft of US jobs

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,590
as US-China trade talks continue.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,280
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,880
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,060
I’m Chris Chappell.

This week’s China news headlines.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,789
You’ve been waiting all year for it.

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,680
No, not the last Stars Wars movie.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,239
President Trump’s State of the Union address.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,860
They hyped it up big time,

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,210
what with that whole, Nancy Pelosi blocking
it

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,350
if we don't have a government thing.

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,019
Man, they know how to sell out a show.

18
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:44,889
And may I just ask, have you been enjoying

19
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,999
your government shutdown purge?

20
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,170
I know I have.

21
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,190
What’s that Shelley?

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,809
Crime is still illegal during a government
shutdown?

23
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,459
Yes of course I know that.

24
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,659
Anyway, this week we finally got

25
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,019
this year’s State of the Union address,

26
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,279
and the state of the union is…great...again?

27
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,700
I assume.

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,800
But in the hour plus long speech,

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,250
President Trump delivered on his crowd pleasing
favorite—

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,250
China.

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,090
“We are now making it clear to China

32
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,810
that after years of targeting our industries

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,159
and stealing our intellectual property,

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,850
the theft of American jobs and wealth

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,940
has come to an end.”

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,680
And the crowd goes wild!

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,120
Although, that’s still just aspirational.

38
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,540
The Chinese Communist Party hasn’t actually

39
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,460
stopped stealing American jobs and wealth.

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,380
But that’s what Trump hopes to get out of

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,590
the latest round of trade negotiations.

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,840
There’s less than a month left for the US
and China

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,829
to agree to a new trade deal.

44
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,960
If that fails, President Trump will levy a
25% tariff

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,799
on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports.

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,759
Or, I guess, they’ll just extend the deadline.

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,799
Which would be great,

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,760
since if all the US-China conflicts are suddenly
solved,

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,700
I’d go out of business.

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,080
I’m not worried though,

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
because getting the kind of trade deal

52
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,100
will be tough.

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,129
“I have great respect for President Xi

54
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,360
and we are now working on a new trade deal
with China.

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,421
But it must include real structural change

56
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,680
to end unfair trade practices,

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,150
reduce our chronic trade deficit,

58
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,230
and protect American jobs.”

59
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,540
All of that would mean real structural changes

60
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,730
to the Chinese Communist Party’s rule—

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,870
the kind authoritarian states don’t like
to make.

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,870
According to Bloomberg,

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,260
“U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer

64
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,019
and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

65
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,290
will lead a delegation to Beijing next week

66
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,269
to lay the groundwork for a meeting

67
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,730
between Trump and Xi later this month.”

68
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,650
The last time Trump was in China,

69
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,519
Xi Jinping pulled out all the stops,

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,900
including giving Trump a rare tour of the
Forbidden City.

71
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,750
And man, Trump had an unreadable poker face.

72
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,040
Do, do dooo, no plans to launch a trade war.

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,370
And then he launched a trade war.

74
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,340
We’ll have more on the trade war as it develops.

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,760
Unless it ends in a few weeks.

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
But it’s not going to.

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,940
The Chinese Communist Party has been,

78
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,689
let’s say, encouraging wealthy

79
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,200
Chinese billionaires around the world

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,060
to influence politics in foreign countries.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,790
Australia had a bad case of it—

82
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,390
thanks to loose campaign financing laws.

83
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,400
So loose, Chinese nationals like this guy,

84
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
Huang Xiangmo,

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,519
could contribute to their favorite political
parties.

86
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,459
Over the years, Huang donated millions

87
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,950
to various Australian political parties.

88
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,060
The problem is—

89
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,379
he’s connected to the Communist Party’s

90
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,160
United Front Work Department,

91
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,420
“an arm of the Chinese Communist Party

92
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,239
that promotes Chinese foreign policy abroad.”

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,400
But last year,

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,540
the Australian government changed campaign
finance laws

95
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,920
to restrict foreign donations.

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,709
And just this week,

97
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,530
Australia canceled Huang Xiangmo’ permanent
residency,

98
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,540
and denied his citizenship request,

99
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,340
and effectively banned him from the country.

100
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Of course, the shady links to the Communist
Party

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,840
and generous donations played no part in the
decision.

102
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,690
No, not at all.

103
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,880
According to the Sydney Morning Herald,

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,590
which first broke the story,

105
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,930
it was for a range of reasons,

106
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,290
including character grounds.

107
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,190
Obviously, I mean,

108
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,750
who wears a belt with his initial on it the
buckle.

109
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,530
That’s pretty tasteless.

110
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,530
Shelley!

111
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,160
You take that down!

112
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,080
Happy Lunar New Year!

113
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,980
Or as they call it in China, “New Year.”

114
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,090
February 5th marked the year of the pig.

115
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,820
Not the capitalist pig, mind you.

116
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,410
More like, the animal farm pig.

117
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,980
Anyway, both China and Taiwan

118
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,910
decided to use the Lunar New Year Celebrations

119
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,580
as an excuse to release propaganda videos.

120
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,250
Now with all these beautiful shots of Taiwan,

121
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,360
you might think the Taiwan tourism department

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,750
made this one.

123
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Nope!

124
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,360
It was the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.

125
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,680
They juxtaposed images of PLA jets and bombers

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
soaring through the sky

127
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,420
is kind of the giveaway.

128
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,770
It’s kind of like taking a girl out for
Valentine’s Day, saying,

129
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,060
“Babe, I got you a little something.

130
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,370
It’s a gun!

131
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,370
For me.

132
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,180
To force you to marry me.

133
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,630
Which I’d like to do peacefully.”

134
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,490
So Taiwan released this video

135
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,190
with tanks firing and missiles launching

136
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,570
saying we are ready

137
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,130
Which is like the girl saying, “Bring it.”

138
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,420
I never thought I’d say it,

139
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,630
but, by comparison,

140
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,410
I have to give the Chinese PLA points for
subtlety.

141
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,630
Though Taiwan’s Premier did win

142
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,580
some subtlety points back in this video,

143
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,840
where he criticized the Chinese Communist
Party’s

144
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,350
handling of swine flu.

145
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,420
Why Winnie the Pooh?

146
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,950
It’s a reference to Xi Jinping,

147
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,280
that Xi Jinping does not like.

148
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,260
Good news in a kind of...horrible news sort
of way.

149
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,100
An Australian-led study is calling for the
retraction

150
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,370
of 400 scientific papers because the organs

151
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,600
may have come from people

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,220
who didn’t voluntarily give them up.

153
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,060
We’ve known for a while now that

154
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,940
the Chinese Communist Party kills both criminal
prisoners

155
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,070
and prisoners of conscience for their organs.

156
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,360
But apparently, some in the medical community

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,980
have been a bit slow on the uptake.

158
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,280
Probably because they don’t watch enough
China Uncensored.

159
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,610
Anyway, the study “exposes a mass failure

160
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,640
of English language medical journals

161
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,730
to comply with international ethical standards
in place

162
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,640
to ensure organ donors provide consent for
transplantation.”

163
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,670
This is not the first time something like
this has happened.

164
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,590
In 2017, the prestigious medical journal Liver
International,

165
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,730
retracted a scientific paper by Chinese surgeons.

166
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,760
Over four years,

167
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,840
Chinese surgeons examined the outcomes

168
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,110
of almost 600 liver transplants.

169
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,090
Problem is, it's basically impossible

170
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,500
for a single hospital to do that many liver
transplants,

171
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,390
especially at a time when China barely had
any organ donors.

172
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,370
But hey, to save a few lives,

173
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,030
you have to commit a few crimes against humanity,
right?

174
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,600
China’s Skynet is really making progress.

175
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,920
And no, I’m not talking about Skynet from
Terminator.

176
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,750
Chinese authorities actually named

177
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,150
their mass surveillance program Skynet.

178
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,940
And according to Radio Free Asia,

179
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,610
by 2022,

180
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,640
there will be almost three billion surveillance
cameras in China.

181
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,690
In other words,

182
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,020
there will be about two cameras for every
person in China.

183
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,340
Smile!

184
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,830
Chinese hackers have...hacked...

185
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,700
a Norwegian software company.

186
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,690
“Visma is one of Europe's largest

187
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,360
cloud-based managed service providers,

188
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
with over 850,000 customers

189
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,710
and net revenue of over $1 billion.”

190
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,810
The hackers released malware in Visma’s
internal system,

191
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,240
but the company says none of their client
servers were infected.

192
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,610
The attacks were carried about by

193
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,210
a well known state-backed hackers

194
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,400
called APT10.

195
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400


196
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,780
In December, the US Justice Department

197
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,090
charged two Chinese nationals believe

198
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,150
to be a part of APT10.

199
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,310
They were charged with being part of

200
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,659
hacks on 45 US companies

201
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,389
and many more in 11 other countries.

202
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,389
Very prolific.

203
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,639
A group of human rights... groups...

204
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,750
are calling on the UN

205
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,920
to look into the Chinese Communist Party’s

206
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,750
persecution of the Uighur ethnic minority
in Xinjiang.

207
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,860
Human Rights Watch,

208
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,480
Amnesty International,

209
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,870
the Geneva-based International Service for
Human Rights,

210
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,660
and the World Uyghur Congress,

211
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,060
have called on the UN’s Human Rights Council

212
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,279
to investigate the mass detention of Muslims
in China.

213
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,930
“Human rights activists say it is

214
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,750
one of the dozens of political reeducation
camps

215
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,990
where up to a million Muslims are said to

216
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,000
have been detained in China's northwest Xinjiang
province

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,370
in recent years.”

218
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,709
Now, appealing to the UN Human Rights Council
is a good thing.

219
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,230
The problem is, China sits on the UN Human
Rights Council...

220
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,269
for some reason.

221
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,740
But if the Chinese Communist Party

222
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,430
uses its position on the UN’s Human rights
council

223
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,170
to block this inquiry, well,

224
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,170
these human rights groups can always go over
their heads

225
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,329
and appeal to the UN Security Council.

226
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:38,329
And I’m sure that’ll put

227
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,360
the Chinese Communist Party in its place.

228
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,959
I’m just kidding,

229
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,889
China’s on the UN Security Council too.

230
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,760
I’m sad now.

231
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,640
And finally, in a story that really stinks,

232
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,700
Malaysian rainforests are being threatened..

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,360
.by Chinese demand for durians.

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,170
If you don’t know what a durian is,

235
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,000
I’m envious of your ignorance.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,970
Durian has been called the king of fruits.

237
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,680
It smells like a mix of rotting garbage,

238
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,230
an everything bagel,

239
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,480
and my grandma’s basement.

240
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,999
And yet, “Soaring demand for durians in
China

241
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:17,779
is being blamed for a new wave of deforestation
in Malaysia,

242
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,129
with environmentalists warning

243
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,790
vast amounts of jungle is being cleared

244
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,709
to make way for massive plantations of the
spiky,

245
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,180
pungent fruit.”

246
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,050
And it’s looking pretty bad.

247
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,699
This is a durian plantation on the outskirts
of Kuala Lumpur.

248
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,430
If you put your nose up to the screen,

249
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,699
you can actually smell it.

250
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:36,699
And look,

251
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,209
there’s a lot of great reasons to destroy
our planet,

252
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,269
but durian is not one of them!

253
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,829
Do it for money,

254
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,829
or power,

255
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:46,089
or to eliminate pandas...

256
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,949
but don’t do it for durian.

257
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:51,040
That’s this week’s China news headlines.

258
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Before we go,

259
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,009
now is the time when I answer questions from
you,

260
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,620
my loyal 50-cent army—

261
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,750
fans of the show who support what we do

262
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,089
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

263
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,139
Largezo asks,

264
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,540
“Does the PRC have universal healthcare?”

265
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,959
Good question!

266
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,040
Despite all the promises of communism,

267
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,009
or socialism with Chinese characteristics,

268
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,810
it turns out, taking care of the people

269
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,759
isn’t one of the Communist Party’s top
priorities.

270
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,350
It’s more interested in...taking care of
the people.

271
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,420
According to the New York Times,

272
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,790
“The country does not have

273
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,670
a functioning primary care system,

274
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,910
the first line of defense for illness and
injury.

275
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,430
China has one general practitioner

276
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,240
for every 6,666 people,

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,019
compared with the international standard

278
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,840
of one for every 1,500 to 2,000 people,

279
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,670
according to the World Health Organization.”

280
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,740
Hospitals are understaffed,

281
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
overworked,

282
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,209
and doctors underpaid.

283
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,180
Plus, constant vaccine scandals.

284
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,370
It’s gotten to the point where public hospitals

285
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,449
rely on bribery to survive.

286
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:59,850
And people are literally scalping tickets
to see doctors.

287
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,129
Now in 2016,

288
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,709
Xi Jinping launched Healthy China 2030.

289
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,600
It’s basically the first long term plan

290
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,430
to improve China’s health care

291
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,790
since the communists took over in 1949.

292
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,949
On paper,

293
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:13,990
China has some degree of

294
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,270
cradle to grave healthcare coverage.

295
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,160
But in practice, well,

296
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,749
it’s socialism with Chinese characteristics.

297
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,560
Thanks for you question.

298
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,529
Why am I answering questions on the show?

299
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,570
It’s because a lot of advertisers

300
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,079
don’t dare to work with a show

301
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,819
that criticizes the Chinese Communist Party.

302
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,360
So we rely on support from viewers like you

303
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,999
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

304
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,209
Answering your questions on the show

305
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,410
is one of my ways of saying thanks.

306
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,709
So head over to patreon.com/chinaucnensored

307
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,949
to find out how you can keep China uncensored.

308
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:47,949
Thanks for watching.

309
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,220
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

310
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,240
See you next time.
