1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,880
In front of me I'veâ€¦ mmf.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,760
-In front of me I've got an...
-"Ooh".

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,800
"Ooh. In front of me... Ooh!

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,720
-"I say!"
-What's under there?

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
"In front of me I've got things
you're not allowed to see. Haha."

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,200
And now I will fiddle with my trousers.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,440
Right, this is the thing, right every f***ing
show we've done ever,

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,960
be it kitchen, be it in here,
he has rearranged his crotchular area,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,760
just as he's come on to do something...
oh, bloody hell.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,560
Have you got that on camera?

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,360
Grant, are we rolling?
We are rolling.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,280
Right, that needs to be an extra,
is the number of times across the years

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,040
that Matt has decided to reposition himself.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,560
Please put your phones
back on aeroplane mode, like I haven't.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Wow, that's getting diminishing returns
every time.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm doing it because I find it funny.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,120
That's fair.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,480
That's why we're here, we find this funny.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,440
We do this without you.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,680
Are you okay there, Gary?

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't know, I had a big Cumberland sausage
on the way down and it ain't half repeating.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,480
One of 'em just starts going down.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,280
"That was me!"

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,480
Curse this British food.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,640
Then one of them pops,
"You hear the artillery!"

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,120
Is this the effect that the Glaswegian
paella is having on me?

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
What a filthy euphemism.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,120
Glaswegian paella! It's sausage and chips.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
And sauce!

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,040
And sauce!
