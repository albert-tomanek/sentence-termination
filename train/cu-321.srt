00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,179
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,960
China wants to dominate the final frontier:

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,220
Space.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,440
Even though apocalyptic levels of pollution

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,700
are making China look more and more like a
gutter,

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,060
Chinese officials are still looking at the
stars.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,450
Maybe they've been reading Oscar Wilde?

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,580
Anyway, China has ambitious space plans,

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,280
the kind that would have rivaled the US and
the Soviet Union

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,750
during the Cold War space race.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,820
But I've got bad news for China.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,140
If they want to claim territory based on ancient
Chinese naval exploration,

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,140
then this flag means the moon belongs to America!

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,840
Actually, according to the 1967 Outer Space
Treaty,

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,530
the moon doesn't belong to anyone.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,920
Except the Decepticons.

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,790
Yet despite the risk of being killed by giant
robots,

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,000
China is shooting for the moon.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,559
And even if they miss, they'll still land
among the stars.

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,219
So here are 5 things you should know about
China's space program.

22
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,220
Number 5

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,280
The US is really not okay with it.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,880
Did you watch the movie The Martian?

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,360
Perhaps the most unrealistic part

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,320
is when the US and Chinese space agencies
work together.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
In reality,

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,460
the US government has banned NASA from working
with China,

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,610
and neither are Chinese nationals allowed
to visit NASA facilities

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,580
without a special waver.

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,729
Chinese astronauts,

32
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,329
or as they call them, "Taikonauts",

33
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,060
are also barred from the International Space
Station.

34
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,659
The ban has been in place since 2011,

35
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:42,580
primarily because of an effort by recently
retired US Congressman Frank Wolf.

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,979
He was a major player on the funding committee
for NASA since 2001.

37
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,140
Wolf was concerned that cooperation between
NASA and Chinese space agencies

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,840
would give them an opportunity to steal US
technology,

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,700
something the Chinese military is in fact
doing constantly

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,579
in a wide variety of US industries.

41
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,970
Wolf also said his concern is "a moral issue"—

42
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,640
that with China's human rights record,

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,880
the US shouldn't be dealing with China at
all.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,450
Number 4

45
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,750
China's military has space ambitions.

46
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,840
In the 1980s,

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
the US and Soviet Union were both developing
anti-satellite technology.

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,080
But, because blowing up something that's orbiting
around the planet

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,790
creates very problematic clouds of debris,

50
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,060
both sides stopped development.

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,440
For reasons you can see in the movie Gravity.

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,260
So the international community was a little
miffed

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,420
when China performed its own anti-satellite
test in 2007.

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,830
It created the largest space debris cloud
in history

55
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,379
after they blew up one of their own aging
satellites.

56
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,090
That debris is still out there in space.

57
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,569
It poses a risk to any other satellites in
nearby orbits,

58
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,620
and any other spacecraft.

59
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:06,080
And that's just the tip of the space-berg.

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,170
Earlier in 2015, a US Congressional panel
issued a report

61
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,220
that says China's space program threatens
the US military.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,140
The report says Chinese military analysts
believe

63
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,209
space will be "the dominant battlefield,"

64
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,269
and that space warfare is "inevitable."

65
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,870
This involves the Chinese military being able
to

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,240
"freely use space and to deny the use of space
to adversaries."

67
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,080
Number 3

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,440
China is building a giant ground-based space
station in Argentina.

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,620
Don't worry...

70
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,700
It's for exclusively scientific and civilian
purposes.

71
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,099
The new space base includes a 100-foot-wide
satellite dish

72
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:50,739
that can track unmanned Chinese vehicles traveling
to Mars and the Moon.

73
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,750
However, despite the surely peaceful intent

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,330
of China's military-led space operations,

75
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,310
the political opposition party in Argentina
was concerned that,

76
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,620
in addition to tracking Chinese space probes,

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,890
it could just as easily be used to track US
military operations—

78
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,049
and that could drag Argentina into a military
conflict with the United States—

79
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,379
should the Chinese military ever decide to
use the base for

80
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,479
not scientific and civilian purposes.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,800
Number 2

82
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,000
China might soon be the only country with
an orbiting space station.

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,020
So in 2024,

84
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,879
the International Space Station will be decommissioned

85
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,080
and allowed to crash into the ocean.

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,270
But by 2022,

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,589
China plans to have completed its own Tiangong
space lab.

88
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:39,330
If that succeeds,

89
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,150
China's Tiangong space lab might be the only
game in town.

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,220
Um, orbit.

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,840
China originally wanted to be a part of the
International Space Station,

92
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:52,139
but with that whole "the US won't make space
deals with China" thing,

93
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,789
China decided to build its own.

94
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,849
And the US is not invited.

95
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,969
It's going to be a modular space station.

96
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,319
The first part is already in orbit around
the planet,

97
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,819
though since it's just a prototype, it'll
come down.

98
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:07,830
The Tiangong-2 is scheduled for launch this
year.

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,569
It will be able to house a crew of 3 people.

100
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,659
And in 2022, Tiangong-3 will join it,

101
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:17,499
forming the core of what will be a large modular
space station.

102
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:21,559
Other modules, like a lab, can then be sent
up and attached.

103
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,779
And finally, Number 1

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,220
China may have faked its first space walk.

105
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:32,219
Back in 2008, China carried out its first
successful space walk.

106
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,079
Unless you believe they faked the whole thing.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,729
Which apparently a lot of people do.

108
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,669
Now claiming this is fake is a pretty bold
statement to make,

109
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,379
but the Communist Party didn't do itself any
favors

110
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,839
when state-run Xinhua released an article

111
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,039
containing a dialogue with the astronauts

112
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,479
that took place after the successful launch
of their rocket.

113
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,720
The problem is, that article came out two
hours before the launch,

114
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,199
and it was dated two days in the future.

115
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,229
Oops!

116
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,569
Okay, so they prewrote a propaganda piece.

117
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,779
Well, what do you expect from state-run media?

118
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,639
That's what they do.

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,419
But that still doesn't mean that this footage
is necessarily fake.

120
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,649
But here's how the argument goes.

121
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:16,939
You see that?

122
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,449
Did that look like bubbles to you?

123
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,770
The allegation is that this whole thing was
actually filmed

124
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,399
in an underwater practice tank.

125
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,379
That's why you see bubbles.

126
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,499
And also, the way the flag waves looks to
some people like there's water resistance.

127
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:36,139
But there might also be scientific explanations
for those things.

128
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,409
Anyway, you can watch the debunking video
here if you want.

129
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,849
So what do you think?

130
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,119
Real or fake?

131
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,330
And what do you think is in store for China's
space ambitions?

Once again, I'm your host Chris Chappell.

134
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,019
See you next time.

135
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,280
You know the saying, "If you build it they
will come?"

136
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,889
Well, in China, they didn't come.

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,940
Xi Jinping

138
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,800
Zhou Yongkang

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Mao. Mao. Mao.

140
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,960
Barack Obama

141
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,460
Obama

142
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,260
I love Chris

143
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,900
OFC?!
