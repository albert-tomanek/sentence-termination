1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,040
Knives

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,979
made from Bombs.

3
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:06,630
Find out how Taiwan master craftsman

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,320
turned tragedy into treasure.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,880
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,519
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,390
They say when life gives you lemons,

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,390
make lemonade.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,180
That’s what this guy does.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,480
Only instead of life,

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,480
it was a Chinese Communist Party invasion.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,140
And instead of lemons,

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,540
it was bombs.

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,980
This is the island of Kinmen.

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,460
It belongs to Taiwan,

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,820
a.k.a. the Republic of China.

17
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,610
But just five miles across the water,

18
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,760
that’s Mainland China.

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
For decades,

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,100
the Chinese Communist Party shelled the island.

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,970
The blockade made life on Kinmen difficult.

22
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,710
There wasn’t even enough metal

23
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,960
to build basic things like farming tools,

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,790
nails, or screws.

25
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,989
But, there were over a million

26
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,070
discarded steel bombshells on the island.

27
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,700
So Wu Tseng-dong’s grandfather—

28
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,910
a blacksmith—

29
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
started turning them into those basic tools.

30
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,930
And then eventually, knives.

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,840
Now Wu Tseng-dong carries on the tradition.

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,990
I visited Maestro Wu’s workshop in Kinmen

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,689
to see for myself how he turns

34
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,860
an old Communist bomb into a work of art.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,520
Old, discarded bombshells fill Maestro Wu’s
shop.

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,959
Built for destruction,

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,389
soon each of these will be transformed

38
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,380
into an exquisite knife.

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,840
First we select our bomb.

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,440
And they are heavy.

41
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,940
Maestro Wu cuts a small section of steel.

42
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,670
Each shell can be turned into multiple knives.

43
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,109
The steel used in bombshells

44
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:41,079
is particularly dense and solid.

45
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,099
Perfect for knife-making.

46
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,100
The piece of steel is heated till it glows.

47
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,670
This machine hammers flat the steel.

48
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,139
In the old days,

49
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,889
this process was done by hand.

50
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:56,259
Maestro Wu repeats the process of heating
and pounding,

51
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,549
shaping the blade’s thickness.

52
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,189
As a master craftsman,

53
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,539
he can determine the right thickness by feel.

54
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,259
It takes years of experience to get it right.

55
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,720
An incision is made in the steel.

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,679
And that gets pounded with a hammer

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,879
into the knife’s handle.

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,120
Now a machine is used to cut the edge of the
knife.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,620
A grinding wheel refines the blade.

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,730
As sparks fall to the floor, the knife begins
to take shape.

61
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,599
Each wheel becomes finer,

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,629
until the knife is buffed to a fine sheen.

63
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,930
Finally, Maestro Wu stamps on his seal.

64
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,569
And as a special treat,

65
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,180
he engraves something special

66
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,430
into out new butcher’s knife:

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,990
China Uncensored—Zhongguo Jiemi.

68
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,040
The perfect end to a Communist bombshell.
