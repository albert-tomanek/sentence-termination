1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,920
Markets are surging.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,810
Optimism is in the air.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,920
Trump said he’ll delay launching new tariffs
on China...

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,370
and that a trade deal could be close.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,320
But will the Chinese Communist Party keep
its promises?

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,439
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,939
Optimism is in the air.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,939
On Sunday,

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,519
President Donald Trump made an announcement

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,239
that could start to scale back the US-China
trade war.

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,849
Trump said...well, tweeted,

13
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,660
“I will be delaying the U.S. increase in
tariffs

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,970
now scheduled for March 1.”

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,280
Back in early December,

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,940
Trump gave China 90 days to make concessions

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,269
on issues like unfair trade practices

18
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:44,649
and intellectual property theft.

19
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,370
And if no deal could be reached,

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,010
the US would hit China with a new round of
tariffs.

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,480
Those tariffs would affect 200 billion dollars
of Chinese goods.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,839
The tariffs are currently at 10 percent,

23
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,769
but would go up to 25 percent

24
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,829
if no deal is reached by March 1.

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:02,829
Except now,

26
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,640
Trump has extended that deadline.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,780
Adding that,

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,220
“Assuming both sides make additional progress,

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,990
we will be planning a Summit for President
Xi and myself,

30
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,800
at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement.”

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,010
So they’re heading to Trump’s golf estate
in Florida.

32
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,770
I mean, any excuse to get out of Washington.

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,090
Or maybe it’s because Florida is the best
place

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,020
for Xi Jinping to experience American culture.

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,189
I would know.

36
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,290
I was in Florida two years ago for the last
meeting.

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,390
Or maybe Trump just extended the trade agreement
deadline

38
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,450
while he’s meeting with North Korean leader

39
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,579
Kim Jong-un this week.

40
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,450
After all, the Chinese regime wouldn’t want
to

41
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,789
risk the trade agreement by interfering with
that.

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,549
Regardless, Xi Jinping is extremely happy

43
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,830
that Trump has agreed to extend the trade
talks.

44
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,920
I believe we have footage of his reaction.

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,080
And the stock market was happy, too.

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,189
The Dow Jones ticked higher.

47
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,409
And former commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez

48
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,159
struck a guardedly optimistic note.

49
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,229
“I hope this is for real.

50
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,320
I mean the marketplace needs it,

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,940
the world economy needs it.

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,720
I can’t think of a better piece of news
for 2019

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,500
that the US-China trade war is beginning to
tone down.”

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,330
Even legendary investor Warren Buffet

55
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,940
skipped his usual Dairy Queen breakfast

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,630
to hop over to CNBC studios

57
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,440
and weigh in on the news.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,880
“Negotiations are tough,

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
this is a big deal to both countries,

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,220
and to some extent you’re playing a game
of chicken.

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
”

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,290
No idea who was the first to blink, though,

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,170
since neither Washington nor Beijing

64
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,980
provided specific details on who made what
concessions.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,040
On Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin—

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,150
who’s sitting right here—

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,540
explained that, well, it’s complicated.

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,270
“There’s hundreds of issues that we’re
dealing with —

69
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,650
everything from financial services to currency,

70
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,480
to forced technology transfer, to aircraft,

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,030
to express shipping, to different industries.”

72
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,710
We don’t have any details yet on

73
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,790
every single one of those hundreds of issues.

74
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,350
But according to this Bloomberg report,

75
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,730
Chinese officials said they would buy

76
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,230
“an additional 30 billion dollars a year

77
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,030
of U.S. agricultural products

78
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,910
including soybeans, corn and wheat.”

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,250
Now according to Bloomberg’s sources,

80
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,300
those extra purchases would be

81
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,440
on top of pre trade war levels.

82
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,780
In 2017,

83
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,050
China imported a total of $24.2 billion

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,540
in American agricultural products.

85
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,400
Last year, when the trade war started,

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,490
that slumped to 16 billion.

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,970
Now if the Bloomberg report is true,

88
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,510
it means China promised to buy

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,690
more than twice as much in agricultural products

90
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,010
as before the trade war started.

91
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,571
That’s absolutely huge!

92
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,610
Huge...ly doubtful.

93
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,540
Or, as Forbes contributor Kenneth Rapoza put
it

94
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,480
“there is no way China is importing

95
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,470
30 billion dollars more in US farm goods”.

96
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,330
That is, unless one of two things happen.

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,570
One—China plans “to ram food down the
throats of its citizens.”

98
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,390
Or two—China “plans to build more silos
to store grain

99
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,509
(which is already rotting in Chinese silos).”

100
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,969
In other words, there is simply not enough

101
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,719
market demand in China

102
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,100
for all that extra food.

103
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,449
Get ready kids, we’re going to do some math.

104
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,330
This table shows China’s agricultural imports
from the US.

105
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,259
The biggest US import is oilseed crops—

106
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,169
which is mostly soybeans.

107
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,759
In 2017,

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,370
China imported 13 billion dollars worth from
the US.

109
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,729
So to make good on its promise to import 30
billion more,

110
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,090
Chinese leaders would have to, say,

111
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,199
force people start eating four times as much
American tofu.

112
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,039
Or wear 25 times as much animal hide.

113
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,100
Or some weird vegan-carnivore combo of the
two.

114
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,360
But fundamentally,

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
the problem is that there’s not enough demand

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,770
in the Chinese market for 30 billion dollars
more

117
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,229
in US agricultural products.

118
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,219
So the only way for this to work

119
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,800
is for China’s central government

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,560
to step in and control the market—

121
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,110
which is the very type of economic interference

122
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,770
that the US is trying to get them to stop.

123
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,349
Of course, there’s a third option:

124
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,349
Make a promise, and then break it.

125
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,190
According to economist Arlan Suderman,

126
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,719
“China will say what needs to be said to
get a deal.”

127
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,060
...suggesting that Chinese leaders will promise
anything,

128
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,810
no matter how unrealistic,

129
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,319
just to buy a bit of time,

130
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,729
with no real intention of actually following
through.

131
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,379
Already there’s signs the Chinese side

132
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,229
might not follow through on its end of

133
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,599
whatever bargain gets made.

134
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,599
On Monday,

135
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,590
Chinese state run media Xinhua suggested

136
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,740
they might go back on the deal,

137
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,370
saying that “the emergence of new uncertainty

138
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,689
cannot be ruled out.”

139
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,440
Uncertainty like, Xi Jinping had his fingers

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,600
crossed behind his back the whole time.

141
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,639
Maybe that’s why,

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,719
according to multiple insiders,

143
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,330
one of the key sticking points in the trade
talks

144
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,979
is a mechanism to force Chinese authorities

145
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,939
to keep their word.

146
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,030
Both Reuters and Associated Press reported

147
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,219
that American officials have been pressing
hard

148
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,879
for a strong enforcement mechanism

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,090
with penalties if the Chinese regime

150
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,110
fails to keep its promises.

151
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,419
I’m imagining the penalties will be things
like,

152
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,870
China is grounded from trading for a month,

153
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,590
or they’re no longer allowed to go to trade
prom.

154
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,189
Ok, it will actually be something

155
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,860
like the US will resume tariffs.

156
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,830
And somehow I don’t think the Chinese side

157
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,120
is going to be enthusiastic about that one.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
That may be what U.S. Trade Representative

159
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,319
Robert Lighthizer was referring to...

160
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,050
when he told reporters at the White House
that

161
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,210
“we have a few very,

162
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,129
very big hurdles that we still have to face”

163
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,229
before the deal is sealed.

164
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,590
After all, it wouldn’t exactly be the first
time

165
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,259
the Chinese regime has overpromised and underdelivered.

166
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,969
Look no further than all the promises they
made

167
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,879
when they joined the World Trade Organization
in 2001.

168
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,610
They’re still not living up to their commitments—

169
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,469
like respecting intellectual property,

170
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,199
ending state subsidies in key exports,

171
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,539
and opening up their markets fairly to foreign
companies.

172
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:24,720
So when you’re dealing with a regime

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,900
that’s broken commitments on trade

174
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,199
again and again for nearly two decades,

175
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,779
do you really expect them to suddenly change?

176
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,520
Perhaps that’s why—

177
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,360
after striking an optimistic note with Sunday’s
tweets—

178
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,639
Trump sounded a bit more guarded on Monday

179
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,009
when talking about signing the trade deal.

180
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,040
“That could happen fairly soon,

181
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,580
or it might not happen at all.

182
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
OK?

183
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Might not happen at all,

184
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,580
but I think it's going to happen

185
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,939
and it could happen fairly soon.”

186
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,759
So what do you think of the trade deal?

187
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,460
Will the Chinese regime keep its word?

188
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,050
Leave your comments below.

189
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,050
And while you’re still here,

190
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,650
it’s time for me to answer another question

191
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,580
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

192
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,300
with a dollar or more per episode—

193
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,199
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,889
David Michael White asks:

195
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,229
“Matt, which part of Sun Tzu's Art of War

196
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,909
has been the most helpful for your life so
far?”

197
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,189
Ugh, a question for my producer Matt.

198
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,999
Matt, what part of the Art of War

199
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,990
has been most helpful in your life?

200
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,479
The section on using spies.

201
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,389
Spies must be used to infiltrate any organization.

202
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,030
Even China Uncensored.

203
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,360
Thanks for your question, David.

204
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,310
Uh, thanks for watching China Uncensored.

205
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,850
I’m Chris Chappell.

206
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,980
See you next time?
