00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,560
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,160
Joining me today, please welcome,
he reads books y' know, it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,200
Hey up.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,920
♪ Have you ever seen your granny passing water
down by the old mill stream?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,720
♪ She pisses for an hour and a quarter
and you can't see her arse for steam ♪

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,440
The bounciest man on the internet, Matt Gray.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,520
Hi!

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,560
This is the final episode and I'm feeling
a bit like a teacher on the last day of school.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,880
But nevertheless,
today we are talking about the sweater curse.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,400
F*** off, that's no way
we're ending this on jumpers.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,360
-The sweater curse?
-The sweater curse.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,240
Chafing.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,960
Yeah, absolutely, if you're jogging
on the nipples, or so I am told.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Don't jog on anybody's nipples, Gary,
it's very rude, even if they've asked.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,040
"What I do in the comfort my own hotel room,
is none of your business."

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,680
This sounds like it's the title
for a Goosebumps book.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Well, the alternate title for this article
is the Curse of the Love Sweater.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,840
-The love sweater.
-That sounds like a different type of novel.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
I think I've seen that film,
I paid a few pounds for it,

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
and well, it happened late at night,

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,120
and well, it certainly didn't record properly
as it turned out.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,920
And you know a lot about my reading habits,
if I'm calling the Goosebump books 'novels'.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
So small.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah, one of the great works of literature
is Say Cheese and Die.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
We're talking about a genre of sweaters,
if you like.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,960
-A genre of sweaters.
-A genre.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,800
That may have been slightly too fancy
a term to use.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,520
-A genre?
-Romance, westerns, large print?

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,400
Romance, I'm going to give you a point
for romance.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,520
It's… it's, of course, yeah, well, eh?

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,960
I like how fast you went from 'I completely
understand that' to 'I have no idea.'

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,080
It was like a sliding scale.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,280
It was a gently Buddhist experience,
that, actually.

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,920
In a 2005 poll, 15% of knitters said they had
experienced the sweater curse first hand.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,440
Is it just really hard to knit
a specific type of sweater?

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,360
Not, this is not what that's about.
I mean it is,

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,960
it's a massive investment to actually
knit a sweater, in time and money.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
Has their relationship broken down because
they've spent so much time knitting?

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,520
I don't know what my face was pulling there.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
It was great, just roll with it.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
I think the word
you were looking for is 'climax'.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,520
'Relationship breaking down'
is the key word there.

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,760
What might the curse of the love sweater be?

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,480
The sweater's only half finished
before the break up happens.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,120
"But I've knitted it for you."

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
And that's the key, that's the absolute key.

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,560
"It's a present."

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,440
The belief that if you give a hand-knit sweater
to a significant other,

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,240
it will lead to the recipient
breaking up with the knitter.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
-Really?
-Wow!

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,160
Or the relationship will end
before the sweater is even completed.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,640
You are absolutely right.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,560
Knit small things.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,960
Or have a small significant other.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
There are six possible mechanisms here,

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,920
but it does say this has not been
studied systematically.

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,360
Divorced beheaded died,
divorced beheaded survived.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,560
"Henry, I've made you this swea...
well, you know what, never mind."

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,200
You'd have to keep putting new panels in
for his girth, wouldn't you?

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,480
Also how does a poncho stay on
when you've been beheaded?

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,040
Depends if you try doing cartwheels in it
or not really, doesn't it?

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
Depends how much stump there is left.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
Can I say, at no point in humanity's
awful beheading history

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,400
has everyone looked at it and gone,
"Would that work with a poncho?"

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,040
Six mechanisms.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,440
Knit knit knit, knit knit purl,
knit purl knit, knit purl purl, purl purl purl.

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,400
That's five.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,760
The other combination, there must be six,
it's three things.

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,520
No. These are mechanisms
for why the curse might happen.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Spent too long knitting
and not enough attention on your lover.

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Yeah, I'll give you a point for that.

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
The knitter loves their sweater
a little too much,

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,120
and pesters the significant other.

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
Spends too much time needling them.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,080
Hey!

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
-No.
-This is why we're finishing this s***!

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,800
I don't know, that was a pearler.

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Hey!

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,640
Knitting gags, this is what you came for,
isn't it, knitting jokes?

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
Stop being crochet-y.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
Hey!

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,080
This is where I try and drop another one in.

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
Hey!

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,800
We'll cast you off at that.

86
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
Oh!

87
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,560
This is what you want!
Did you hear that?

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,000
That was the sound of knitting pun fatigue,
just clunk, just appearing.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
Did you think we knew that much about knitting?

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,800
-No.
-No. That's…

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,320
But we know words.

92
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,440
So, yes, misdirected attention is one of them.

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I suppose it did cost a bit of wool,
might cost, yeah.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,360
Wool costs a lot, if you pick a nice wool.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,080
Oh, yes, but that's not listed here.

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,040
It doesn't fit and they all get all grumpy
because they said they're too fat or too thin.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,760
I'll, yeah, I'll give you that,
insufficient gratitude.

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,040
Oh!

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
'Why are you knitting me a jumper?

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,640
'I look s*** in jumpers and I don't like them,
and I don’t like wool.'

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
And I don't like you, bye.

102
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
You know what, that … yes, aversion.

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,440
The significant other
may not want to wear it,

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,480
because the sweater looks bad or conveys
overly domestic connotations.

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,880
-Oh, like 'Number One Husband' or something.
-Uh-huh.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Or you look like you're wearing a jumper
that's been knitted by your significant other.

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Yes.
Why would you start that

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,960
without saying, "Do you want one?"

109
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
That is another problem.

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,800
The person does not actually wear jumpers.

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
We're leading into something here.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
People naturally break up inside of 18 months
because the endorphins change,

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,160
and the jumper might take too long anyway.

114
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,920
Yes.

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,520
Or if it's a really big jumper
then there's a seven year itch.

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Unlucky timing, yeah,
knitting a sweater takes a long time,

117
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,720
and the relationship, it says here,
dies of natural causes which...

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Why is there not a show like, you know, the …
I don't know...

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,040
The Relationship Coroner, is that what
we're gonna have? I could do that.

120
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,400
Relationship Coroner!

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
We've found our new format, folks.

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,120
It's 'cause you're a dick. Next question?

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,000
No, that's true of most advice...
like, most advice columnists,

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,520
half of their replies are gonna be,
'Break up with them, they’re a dick.'

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
That's… that's literally half of their job.

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,000
That's like my first law of everything,
which is 'Don't be a knob.'

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,560
We have two mechanisms left,
we've gone through timing, aversion,

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,720
misdirected attention, insufficient gratitude.

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Is one of the mechanisms a loom or a weaving
machine, what's a weaving machine called?

130
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
-A loom.
-A loom.

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
It is a loom, yeah.

132
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Have they got a loom and is it
taking up an entire room in the house?

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,640
Actually that's a fair point, because people
have knitting rooms, don't they,

134
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,880
-where they kind of…
"Eey-aga-dun-dai, aga-dun-dai..."

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,120
-I can see you've seen one work before.
-If that doesn't get remixed as a beat,

136
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
I will be very surprised.

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Dope, put a donk on it.

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,400
We have here, 'rescue mission'
as one of the reasons, what might that be?

139
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,400
"The relationship is already dead,
your heartshaped sweater will not save it."

140
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,360
Yeah, basically, yeah.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
Chris Joel, the Relationship Coroner.

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,400
The last one is 'catalyst for
analysing the relationship'.

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,440
-What...
-"You've dropped a stitch,

144
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,320
"you're always dropping things.

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,440
"Can't help but feel you dropped my heart
six months ago."

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,760
Chris Joel, Relationship Coroner.

147
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Also, possibly, wrong meeting.

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,720
What's… what's the catalyst there?
What's the sweater done?

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,680
Are you just staring at someone knitting
and knitting and knitting and knitting,

150
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
and thinking to yourself,
what the f*** am I doing here?

151
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
That’s close enough, yes.

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,240
You have received a gift that has had so much
time and effort put into it, that you go,

153
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
'This really isn't a fair trade here,
I'm not really, oh, oh, oh...'

154
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,240
And we could have been doing it
while you knittin'.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,920
-Not while you're knitting.
-Gary Brannan, relationship defibrillator.

156
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,000
The idea would be you…

157
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,040
What's some of the advice given to knitters
to avoid the sweater curse,

158
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
other than don't knit a sweater?

159
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Ask permission.

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,520
Yes. Yes, involve the person
you're trying to knit a sweater for.

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,200
Don't simply go,
"Here's a sweater," out of nowhere.

162
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,760
"Here's a thing I spent three years making,
here, you love it, don't you?"

163
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,520
So the categories on this article,

164
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,360
There is… there is a game here where you try
and guess the article from the categories.

165
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,840
Because here it has curses, knitting,
luck, and clothing controversies.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,760
Oh, we are looking at clothing controversies.

167
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Yes, we are.

168
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,800
God, you're glad you came aren't you?

169
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,680
I guarantee that at least one of these,
I'm going to read the article and go,

170
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,840
about five seconds in,
"Oh no, we're not talking about that."

171
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,680
-I can name one that'll be on the list.
-Yeah.

172
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,160
Lady Gaga's meat dress.

173
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,120
It is not on the list.

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,920
Janet Jackson's tit.

175
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,160
Surprisingly not on the list,

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,800
but the phrase, 'Wardrobe malfunction' is,
so I'll give you a point.

177
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
Okay, don't Google,
don't look at that one on Wikipedia,

178
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,840
that's got a very revealing photo on it.

179
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
Saves for later.

180
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Alright, clothing controversies
through history, the Dress Act 1746.

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,600
Banning of tartan post 1745.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
-Yes, you are exactly right.
-"You're banned, get out!"

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,040
This is buffalo check, peasant!

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,880
T***.

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes. This was the Act
that made Highland dress illegal in Scotland.

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,440
-Yeah, banned the bagpipes and stuff as well.
-What, dressing in the Highland?

187
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Is that why everybody moved to the cities,
at least they could put a t-shirt on?

188
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,400
There's a place on the Isle of Seil
that is known as the Trouser House.

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
Isn't that just a seal?

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
-Well, you will, you…
-Arf!

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,040
No, you've just got Kiss from a Rose,
kind of always drifting through.

192
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,760
But it's not really an island, it's separated
by a very small amount of water,

193
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,600
-but, so it technically is.
-About a teaspoon.

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,240
Pretty much really, and it's called...
it's known as the Trouser House,

195
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,640
because the rumour, the legend has it

196
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,200
that that's the place you would
change from your tartan,

197
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,360
from your kilt into a pair of trousers
because you're going onto the mainland.

198
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,740
It's almost certainly, to use the terms
historians use,

199
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,520
'w***.'

200
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,440
On that note the Hat Act a few years earlier,
1732.

201
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,040
-Hat Act?
-Is that why everyone wears hats in old films,

202
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,160
because a proper gentleman
would wear their bowler or their top?

203
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,200
They wouldn't need a hat though,
wouldn't need an act to do that.

204
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,160
-It's probably banning or…
-Oh, is it … is it when you do the…

205
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,600
No, it's the spinning down the arm thing,
down the back of the neck and all that dealie.

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
The Hat Act, no,
it is an act of Parliament.

207
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,720
It's limiting the height of stove pipes
in Parliament.

208
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Limiting something,
limiting where the hats are coming from.

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
-Abroad.
-Below.

210
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,960
Was it to stimulate the British hat industry,
therefore banning the import of the hat?

211
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,360
-From where?
-France.

212
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
-No.
-Netherlands.

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,640
I'm still giving you a point but it's
a specific area rather than country here.

214
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,680
-The head.
-Is it east?

215
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,400
-Try again.
-The west.

216
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,120
-Which would be?
-America.

217
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,400
-Yes.
-Banning American hats.

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,480
Banning colonial hats, yes,

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
in order to protect
the British hat industry.

220
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,800
They're all baseball caps, they're not stylish.

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,800
We're going back further now, 1363,
the Statute Concerning Diet and Apparel.

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
This is the sumptuary laws, this, because

223
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,280
Strap yourselves in kids, post…

224
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,720
Here we go, we’re on history,
this is a Brannan one.

225
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,880
And this is the period.
Yeah, yeah, get your phones out,

226
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,200
some of you may wish to.

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,960
Post Black Death there's a massive boom
in the economy.

228
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,360
You get a massive change in how people dress
because people have more disposable income.

229
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
So people's dress is getting out of whack,

230
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,400
the rich people say that the poor people
are dressing too nicely.

231
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,760
So they introduce a law that restricts the kind of
clothes that certain classes of people can wear,

232
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,200
so everyone knows who is who.

233
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,840
Yes.

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you.

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Alright, so I'm now out of
clothing controversies articles.

236
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,720
So I'm going to continue to pick some at random
and we'll see where we go with this.

237
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
Let's do this.

238
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
What was the Rational Dress Society,
1881 in London?

239
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,080
-Sensible dress. No frivolity.
-You can't...

240
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,680
Is it that bit from Jurassic Park where
Ian Malcolm's going on about wearing black?

241
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,040
Can you not wear the square root of minus one?

242
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,720
No πs.

243
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,000
That's imaginary, isn't it, not irrational?

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
-I win!
-S***.

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,240
Yeah, I'm not giving you a point for Pi there,
my hand went to the button,

246
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
before I realised it wasn't
remotely the question I'd asked.

247
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,520
-No.
-The Rational Dress Society.

248
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,040
They want people to be dressed properly in
all places and not rough or dirty or scruffy like.

249
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,080
It's not so much about the quality of the dress
as more what the dress does to them.

250
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Does it make everyone look uniform?

251
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Is it a uniform?

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
-No.
-I just realised what the word means...

253
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
-Oh yeah.
-That's what uniform means.

254
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,280
Oh yeah.

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,960
We all learned something today.

256
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,840
Well at least we did.

257
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah, it taught me a lesson.

258
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
The leading members of the society
were Lady Harberton,

259
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Mary Eliza Haweis
, I'm probably mispronouncing that,

260
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,280
and Constance Wilde, the wife of Oscar Wilde.

261
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,960
Now, given we're in 1881 and those are…

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,080
Oh, egalitarian standards of dress.

263
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,320
Egalitarian in what sense?

264
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,080
Gender equality.

265
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,880
Yes, I'll give you the point but it's very
specifically something about women's dress then,

266
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
that men's dress didn't do.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh, is it egalitarian as in like
made out of eagles?

268
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,280
I realise I'm asking three blokes here
who are not from the 1880s but…

269
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,680
Speak for yourself.

270
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,760
Men's dress had certain freedoms
that women's dress didn't back then.

271
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,800
Is it pockets and the ability
to ride a bicycle?

272
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,320
Ooh, I'll give you a point for bicycle

273
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,240
because the Lady Cyclists Association
were very keen on this.

274
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,040
Because ladies were encouraged
to ride side-saddle.

275
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,200
Now imagine how that worked, everybody,

276
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,520
in that they could only kind of
go on one pedal basically,

277
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,240
because skirts.

278
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,720
Is it going back to the big flow-y skirts
and corsetry

279
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,840
and all of that kind of stuff
that they all wore?

280
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,720
What about corsetry?

281
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,080
It was right hurty.

282
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,360
Yes. They were asking for freedom of movement
and absence of pressure.

283
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,760
-Oh!
-I don't blame them.

284
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
The last one then in clothing controversies.

285
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,480
What is vanity sizing?

286
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
Oh!

287
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,000
Again, I heard all the women in the audience
going 'yeah, we know about this'.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
We’ve got three blokes from Yorkshire here,
good luck.

289
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,840
If you can imagine what it would look like
for three monkeys scrapping in a barrel of tar,

290
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,520
this is what it's going to look like right now.

291
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,280
It is where the actual measured dimension
of any given garment of you,

292
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,000
is quite different to the size on the label.

293
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,560
You know how we...
we knew the things about knitting earlier?

294
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,240
-Yeah.
-We might know some things about clothing.

295
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,640
-Gary?
-Yeah, the wife crochets and knits, so...

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,640
Lovely. In which case at the end of the show,
congratulations, you all win this one.

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey!

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Cop-out! Cop-out!

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
I refuse to win.

300
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Fine, Gary and Matt! You win this one.

301
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
Hey!

302
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, I think the winner is the audience.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,860
Aww.

304
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,800
Liar!

305
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,520
No, the real winning is in your hearts.

306
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Jesus, f***.

307
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,800
You are a knob.

308
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Congratulations, you win a DVD
of the little known crossover

309
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,440
between a marsupial from Australia
and a Time Lord from Gallifrey.

310
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,160
It's Skippy the Bush Dr Who.

311
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
Hey!

312
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,720
With that for the final time we say goodbye to
Chris Joel,

313
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,360
-Gary Brannan.
-I don’t want to go.

314
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,160
-Matt Gray.
-Bye.

315
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you around.
