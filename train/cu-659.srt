1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,989
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:05,280
ever wonder how China’s Internet became
so censored?

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,100
You can thank this guy.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,820
Welcome back, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,270
The Internet’s got a new loser!

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,619
Just look at him!

7
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:20,160
No, not Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,330
I mean the happy guy in the chair.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,940
That’s Lu Wei,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,530
China’s Internet Czar.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,890
Former Internet Czar.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,010
That photo’s from 2014.

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,660
He’s not so happy anymore.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,360
Because Lu Wei is the latest high-ranking
official

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,789
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has taken down

16
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,780
in his ongoing purge of political opponents—

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,280
what he calls the “anti-corruption campaign.”

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
According to this announcement,

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,979
Lu Wei has been accused of

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,229
“seriously violating Party discipline.”

21
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,409
Which basically means,

22
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:52,909
he’s as good as convicted,

23
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,899
expelled from the Communist Party,

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,510
and destined for prison.

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,109
Sorry Mark Zuckerberg!

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,190
If you were trying to get Facebook into China,

27
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,210
you chose the wrong guy to Zuck up to.

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,210
Once upon a time,

29
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,320
Lu Wei was basically the ruler of China’s
Internet—

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,000
the guy responsible for earning China

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,540
the coveted title of Freedom House’s

32
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,880
“worst abuser of internet freedom,”

33
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,480
for three years in a row!

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,640
That’s a way less controversial title, by
the way,

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
than People’s Sexiest Man Alive.

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,590
I’m with the Houston Chronicle on this one.

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,219
Kim Jong Un is still waiting for your call,
People Magazine.

38
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,649
Anyway, yes,

39
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:32,630
China is officially the three-time consecutive
champion

40
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,740
of worst internet freedom.

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,380
Take that, Syria!

42
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,350
Wait, Syria still has Internet?

43
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,520
Back to Lu Wei.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,011
The Guardian describes him as the

45
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,370
“powerful and flamboyant former head

46
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,310
of China’s Cyberspace Administration.”

47
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,310
That was the administration

48
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,509
that oversaw Internet censorship.

49
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,030
Lu was certainly powerful.

50
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,520
But flamboyant?

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,350
I mean, he loved to get photo ops

52
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,380
with Western tech giants kissing up to him—

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,000
like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg,

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,749
Apple’s Tim Cook,

55
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,249
and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.

56
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,939
I think it’s more like,

57
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,789
he’s kind of crazy.

58
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,069
He said “Freedom and order are twin sisters.”

59
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,569
Which would make sense

60
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,470
if he was trying to argue that free countries

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,040
are more stable—

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,220
which is usually true.

63
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,290
But I think he was using that to justify

64
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,400
China’s heavy-handed Internet censorship.

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,220
But you know what?

66
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,810
That makes sense, because—

67
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,810
get this—

68
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,050
there’s no censorship on the Chinese Internet!

69
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,439
Yes, China’s top Internet censor says

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,040
there’s no Internet censorship.

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,430
He claims the Internet is simply “managed.”

72
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,430
Which is like selling cruelty-free beef,

73
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,850
and saying the cows weren’t slaughtered.

74
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,670
They were just massaged.

75
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,380
To death.

76
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,790
So it should be no surprise

77
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,680
that Lu Wei is same guy once hired

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,100
a famous songwriter to write the song

79
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,820
“Cyberspace Spirit.”

80
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,240
Powerful Internet country!

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,840
The Web is where glorious dreams are!

82
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,420
Powerful Internet country!

83
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,040
From the distant cosmos to the home we long
for!

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,820
Powerful Internet country!

85
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,880
Tell the world that the China Dream

86
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,720
is lifting Greater China to prominence!

87
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,280
Wow, that’s pretty catchy...

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
in a creepy Soviet way.

89
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,659
Hope I don’t get that stuck in my head.

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,800
And if that song’s not crazy enough,

91
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,299
Lu Wei also allegedly went to parties

92
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,920
serving human breast milk.

93
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,360
Lu Wei also did some practical things.

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,519
Like spearheading China’s plan to eliminate
VPNs,

95
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,519
the special software that allows Chinese netizens

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,930
to get through the Great Firewall of China

97
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,379
and access the real Internet.

98
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,750
And when Lu Wei was in charge of

99
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,170
the Cyberspace Administration of China,

100
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,790
he oversaw the early drafts

101
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,560
of the now infamous Cybersecurity Law

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,750
that requires foreign companies store

103
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,159
their user data inside China—

104
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,900
and give the Chinese Communist Party

105
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,599
full access to that Chinese user data.

106
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
Under Lu Wei,

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,750
the Chinese regime’s grip on social media
tightened.

108
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,570
Internet users had to register with their
real names.

109
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,760
And that means no fake Twitter accounts.

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,320
We know who you are,

111
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,260
Anakin Skywalker.

112
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,570
Also, Lu Wei banned

113
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,690
all of Twitter.

114
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,640
Of course, if you’re on the Chinese internet,

115
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,510
you won’t hear much about the fall of Lu
Wei

116
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,640
because the Chinese Internet is

117
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,580
of course, massively censored.

118
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,580
I mean massaged.

119
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,110
I mean, managed.

120
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,910
China Digital Times discovered this

121
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,950
Propaganda Department directive

122
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,790
that orders media to censor-slash-manage

123
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,940
all comments about Lu Wei.

124
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,780
It’s almost poetic,

125
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,830
how his downfall is being censored

126
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,910
by the very apparatus that he built.

127
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,950
What’s that, Shelley?

128
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,480
We have video of the propaganda directive?

129
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,420
Go ahead.

130
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,880
Ok, ok, you got me.

131
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,980
Man, that song is catchy.

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
Where was I?

133
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,030
Oh right, as I mentioned earlier,

134
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,560
the fall of Lu Wei is tied into Chinese leader

135
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,970
Xi Jinping’s battle against his political
opponents,

136
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,070
a loosely tied faction under former Chinese
leader Jiang Zemin.

137
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,160
Sorry, wrong toad.

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,590
The resemblance is really uncanny.

139
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,760
So Lu Wei was deeply enmeshed in the propaganda
wing

140
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,330
of the Communist Party—

141
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,310
the guys responsible for making the Party
look good.

142
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,310
In other words,

143
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,720
miracle workers.

144
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Somewhat inept miracle workers.

145
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,150
For two decades Lu Wei

146
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,830
“served as party secretary

147
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,530
of the state-run Xinhua news agency,

148
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,350
and Beijing’s propaganda chief,

149
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,840
eventually making it up to deputy head

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,300
of the CCP’s central propaganda department.”

151
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
That means he worked under

152
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,390
the head of Party propaganda,

153
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,470
Liu Yunshan.

154
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,680
Liu was one of the highest ranking members

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,389
of Jiang Zemin’s faction,

156
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,210
and used his clout to undermine Xi.

157
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,470
If you want to learn more about Liu Yunshan,

158
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,530
watch my previous episode online,

159
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,410
“Who Controls China’s Propaganda.”

160
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,890
Xi Jinping has been trying to wrestle

161
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,120
control of the Party’s propaganda

162
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,110
from the Jiang Zemin faction.

163
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,060
Especially when it comes to the Internet.

164
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,980
That’s why Xi Jinping gave himself

165
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,540
so many fancy new titles,

166
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,400
like head of the Central Leading Group

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,370
for Internet Security and Information.

168
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,960
A year ago,

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,740
Lu Wei was mysteriously fired

170
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,750
from the Cyberspace Administration of China.

171
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,890
And Xi Jinping appointed his own guy to replace
him.

172
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,880
Now, Lu Wei has been detained,

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,490
and “Several of Lu’s associates and officials

174
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,050
in charge of regulating online services

175
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,810
have also been taken into custody.”

176
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,040
What’s that, Shelley?

177
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,840
We have video of Lu Wei’s confession?!

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Wow.

179
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Yes, I want to see it.

180
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,320
Hey.

181
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Fool me once, shame on you.

182
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,370
Fool me twice,

183
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,620
shame on...you, twice.

184
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,880
Back to Lu Wei.

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,560
State-run media isn’t being kind to him.

186
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,740
The Global Times wrote,

187
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,600
“Lu was a typical ‘two-faced person,’

188
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,770
as he severely deviated from Party principle

189
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,900
and ruined the image of the cyberspace administration
team

190
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,200
and harmed the development of cyberspace.”

191
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,110
Which really doesn’t make much sense

192
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,620
if you think about it.

193
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,210
Lu Wei did exactly the Communist Party wanted

194
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,580
as far as censoring the Internet.

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,400
And even though he was fired a year ago,

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,430
there hasn’t exactly been a big push

197
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,740
to undo all the controls he put in place.

198
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,050
The internet will continue to be “managed”

199
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,410
to benefit the Communist Party.

200
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,830
But undoing Lu Wei’s work

201
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,160
is not what the investigation of him is about.

202
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,260
If previous purges of high ranking officials

203
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,410
are any indication,

204
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,490
I wouldn’t be surprised if Xi Jinping

205
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,690
is ultimately making his way for Liu Yunshan.

206
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,370
Because even as Lu’s former Xinhua News
Agency

207
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,660
turns on him...

208
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,410
...one thing is clear:

209
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,470
Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign

210
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,570
is not winding down.

211
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,440
And neither is Internet censorship,

212
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,350
just so we’re clear on that.

213
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,250
And Lu Wei’s downfall offers yet another
example

214
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,710
of why doing business in China is risky business.

215
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,010
Remember that photo of Lu and Mark Zuckerberg?

216
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,530
All that hard work spent developing a relationship

217
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,699
with someone who ended up on the wrong side

218
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,659
of a political purge.

219
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,939
Now he’ll have to start all over again

220
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,870
with the new Internet czar.

221
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,870
What a waste.

222
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,659
Kind of like when former Canadian Prime Minister

223
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,509
Stephen Harper met with disgraced Chinese
official

224
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:48,970
and proud Jiang faction member Bo Xilai

225
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,079
right at the beginning of Bo’s downfall

226
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,959
back in 2012.

227
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,660
Which was dumb.

228
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,959
But maybe things will work out better

229
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,959
for Mark Zuckerberg.

230
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,959
After all,

231
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,829
according to Chinese state-run media,

232
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,930
he did spend his time with Lu Wei

233
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,750
praising Xi Jinping’s book

234
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,339
that was conveniently and prominently

235
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,540
placed on a desk.

236
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,480
He even told Lu that he bought the book

237
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,589
for his coworkers, too.

238
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,209
What a boss.

239
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,709
Yes, Shelley?

240
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,089
We have video of Lu talking to Zuckerberg.

241
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,089
Nice try.

242
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,020
I’m not falling for that again.

243
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,960
What?

244
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,580
You promise that it’s not that

245
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,000
Cyberspace Spirit song?

246
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,680
Ok, fine, roll it.

247
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,900
That is the first time I’ve been happy

248
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,490
about being Rickrolled.

249
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,240
Thanks, Shelley.

250
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,730
What do you think of the fall of Lu Wei?

251
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,660
And do you have Cyberspace Spirit?

252
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,780
Leave your comments below.

253
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,740
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

254
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,180
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

255
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,420
see you next time.

256
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,180
Aren’t you happy you have access

257
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
to an uncensored Internet?

258
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,089
Well, depending on what happens

259
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,800
with Net Neutrality at least.

260
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,249
But why not celebrate your uncensored Internet

261
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,810
by visiting ChinaUncensored.tv?

262
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,810
There you can see full half hour episode

263
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,920
that you won’t see on YouTube.

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
And definitely not in China.

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,760
Once again that’s ChinaUncensored.tv.
