1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,550
The Chinese economy is hurting badly

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,200
What does this mean for the rest of the world?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,080
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,420
Joining me today at the Oslo Freedom Forum
in New York

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,279
is economist and China expert,

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,279
Christopher Balding.

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,900
He taught in China for nine years, and now,

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,550
he's an associate professor at the Fulbright
University,

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,759
Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City.

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,759
Thanks for joining.

12
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,060
Thanks for having me, Chris.

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,890
So, China just posted GDP figures for its
third quarter

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,700
and it's the lowest it's been in 27 years.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,780
What does it mean that the official figures
are that low?

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,590
If the official figures are that low,

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,360
it means the reality is that much worse.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,600
I think most economists, in reality,

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,250
are looking at a GDP growth figure, probably
half that.

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,840
Some are speculating it's even worse than
that.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,010
Well, so what does that mean?

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,510
That basically means that China is growing
much slower

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,410
and we're actually seeing this across a range
of activities.

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,420
If you look at the consumer sector,

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,280
which China is touting as the great growth
hope,

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
actually we're seeing,

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,399
in a lot of areas of the consumer sector,

28
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,289
declining growth.

29
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:17,560
Car sales are down significantly,

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,799
phones are down significantly-

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,290
Are these Chinese-made cars and phones,

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,609
or imports of Ford and iPhone.

33
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:28,030
So, in the automotive sector,

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,060
China actually makes most of its own cars.

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,310
It imports relatively small amounts,

36
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,939
primarily of luxury vehicles,

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,939
but China actually produces

38
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,390
and consumes most of its own vehicles.

39
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,729
And so, with the depth of decline that we're
seeing

40
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,590
in consumer durables like washers and dryers,

41
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,590
refrigerators, air conditioners, cell phones,
automobiles,

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,049
and even the food staple, pork,

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,229
it's very, very difficult to see how, for
instance,

44
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,119
the consumer sector is growing strong enough
to drive

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,479
the Chinese economy towards a 6% real GDP
growth figure.

46
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,649
So, are these lower GDP numbers,

47
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:09,989
whatever they may actually be,

48
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,569
an effect of the trade war?

49
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,370
No, these are actually an impact from, really,

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,510
Chinese domestic policy over the years.

51
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,650
A couple of things that we're seeing, for
instance,

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,040
are really high debt figures in households
and corporate sector

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,140
are really restraining a lot of purchases

54
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,960
that people might be making.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,310
Again, if we focus on the consumer sector,

56
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,329
Chinese households now actually have more
debt

57
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,580
than most developed countries like the United
States and Japan,

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,540
things like that, when compared against household
income numbers.

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,439
And, this is also impacting the corporate
sector.

60
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,580
We're seeing a very restrained investment
growth in China because,

61
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,170
even though credit is being pushed,

62
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,349
there's been so much previous investment of
things that have been built,

63
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,469
and now, there's over capacity in a lot of
industries,

64
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,870
in real estate, in other sectors.

65
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,819
And so, people are quite fearful to actually
go out

66
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,110
and invest if they don't believe it's a profitable
project.

67
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,519
So, this is not so much an effect

68
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,689
of anything the Trump administration is doing

69
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:21,280
as much as it is systemic problems with how

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,250
the Chinese communist party has been managing
the economy.

71
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,840
That's absolutely correct.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,810
Probably the most that you could say about
the Trump impact,

73
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,129
if you will,

74
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,680
is that it would be the straw that breaks
the camel's back.

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,849
It's additional stress. It's absolutely not
the driver.

76
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:42,200
And again, just more sense and perspective

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,970
of what we're dealing with,

78
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,920
you'll frequently hear that the trade war

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,189
is driving this global slowdown in growth
or in trade.

80
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,189
And, actually, that's not correct because
this slowdown in growth,

81
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,200
slowdown in trade, is centered in China.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,879
If we look at Chinese trade patterns

83
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,250
with all of its partners,

84
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,439
everywhere from Germany to Australia, Indonesia,
Thailand,

85
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,319
so we're looking, really, to a very broad
range of countries.

86
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,130
Trade with those countries is down across
the board,

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,970
and this isn't just inputs that might go into
an iPhone

88
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,900
that end up in the United States.

89
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,260
These are products that are going to end up
in China.

90
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,139
Iron ore exports from Australia to China are
very slow.

91
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,770
High quality machinery exports

92
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,360
from Japan and Germany to China are very slow.

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
So, we're not just looking at a narrow range
of goods

94
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,210
where there's a trade slowdown with China
and its partners,

95
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,920
but really, across the board,

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,509
across a wide, wide range of countries.

97
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,699
So, because of the systemic problems within
China

98
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,050
that's creating a slowdown in their economy,

99
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,130
which is creating a global economic slowdown.

100
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,300
Is that right?

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,230
I think that's much more accurate.

102
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,139
If you look at the countries that are really

103
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,810
experiencing some economic pressures, if you
will,

104
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,940
Germany being a good example.

105
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,289
They've taken a significant drop in their
exports to China

106
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,660
and that's having a, a significant impact
on the German economy.

107
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,400
That's not from the trade war.

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,470
Germany does not export a lot of products

109
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,490
to China that go through China,

110
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,570
get processed, and end up in the United States.

111
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,139
Germany is exporting a lot of high quality
chemicals,

112
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,639
precision machinery, luxury automobiles, things
like that.

113
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,090
I love German chemicals, myself.

114
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,960
German chemicals are some of the best.

115
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,160
Very different from Burmese chemicals, but-

116
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,581
Low quality Burmese chemicals.

117
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,380
Low quality Burmese chemicals.

118
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,949
And so, we see this spillover that this

119
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,710
is impacting a lot of countries from all over
Asia

120
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,030
and all over Europe.

121
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,060
So, if the Chinese economy continues to slow
down,

122
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,610
what will that mean for the global economy?

123
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,710
I think it's going to mean that

124
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,020
there's going to be a sustained global slowdown
as well.

125
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,300
I'm not necessarily of the opinion

126
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,490
that you're looking at a global recession

127
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,520
in the classical sense.

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,910
Typically speaking, global growth recession

129
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,690
is considered if growth drops beneath, say,

130
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,590
two to 3%.

131
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,210
I think it is possible that you

132
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,889
will see global growth drop beneath two to
3%,

133
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,580
which some might consider a global recession,

134
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,560
but we can expect that to, I think,

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,050
continue for the next couple of years, for
sure.

136
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,330
There's been a lot of talk about

137
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,280
decoupling the U S economy from China.

138
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,400
Would that protect the US economy

139
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,150
if there is a Chinese economic crash?

140
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,330
Well, one of the things that you've seen

141
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,990
go on throughout this trade war

142
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,310
is that actually US trade numbers, in aggregate,

143
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,560
have continued to grow at a relatively steady
pace.

144
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,640
There really hasn't been much of a change.

145
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
And so, everybody is saying,

146
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
"Well, wait a minute.

147
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,660
Why are we seeing trade numbers into the United
States grow,

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,800
essentially, on trend?"

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,659
Well, the reason is very simple.

150
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,870
Basically, the increase in exports from countries
like Mexico,

151
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,569
Vietnam, Thailand, places like that,

152
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,849
is being offset by the decline in exports
from China.

153
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,720
So, basically all we're seeing is,

154
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,060
these Chinese exports move to other countries,

155
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,099
and so, basically, we can expect this process

156
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,190
to continue for the next few years.

157
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,659
Just this week it was announced that, actually,

158
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,389
Samsung has moved all of its production out
of China.

159
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,289
And so, it's very big in Vietnam.

160
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,690
They've been moving into India.

161
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,259
Apple has supposedly set up manufacturing
in India.

162
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,280
And so, basically, we can expect this decoupling

163
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,430
to continue for the next few years, for sure.

164
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,789
So, over the years, many companies

165
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,479
have really tried to get access to the China
market,

166
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,270
but it seems like these risks have been known
for a long time.

167
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,009
Why did they make such a push to get into
the China market?

168
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,130
There was always this mythical,

169
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,009
if we can just sell one t-shirt to each person
in China,

170
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,919
that's a billion t-shirts in sales.

171
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,789
So, whether it was t-shirts,

172
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,939
or financial services or automobiles,

173
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:21,990
that was the focus.

174
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,370
And, for a long time I think people,

175
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,669
companies, were willing to make those trade
offs

176
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:31,670
because they were making a lot of money.

177
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,289
They were entering a semi-protected market.

178
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,370
They were working with SOEs most of the time,

179
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,010
investments of any significant size.

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,729
SOEs being State-Owned Enterprises.

181
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,729
State-Owned Enterprises.

182
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,300
And so, these companies were making a lot
of money.

183
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,570
As things have changed for multiple reasons,

184
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,080
the growth isn't what it is,

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,779
there's surplus capacity under the Xi administration.

186
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,360
The state has taken a much more central role
in everything.

187
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
I think companies have really begun to question
the trade-offs

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,579
that they have to make to be in the Chinese
market.

189
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,160
And so, is that a result of them changing

190
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,540
or the changing situation in China

191
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,120
with the economic downturn?

192
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,730
I think it's a function of both.

193
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,000
You know, if you had confidence in the economy,

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,540
you could say, "Okay, well there's a downturn
right now.

195
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,220
If you start layering on the factors of,

196
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,339
"Oh, well, you know now I have to hire

197
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,850
some communist party bureaucrat

198
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,480
just to hang out in my company all day.

199
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,090
Now if I know that they're going to be stealing
from me,

200
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,910
and now I know that I'm still going to be
asked for bribes,

201
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,740
and all of these other things.",

202
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,700
tariffs, concern about Chinese politics,

203
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,010
it definitely, in aggregate, pushes companies
to leave.

204
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,000
We don't see, historically, in any country,

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,649
we don't see companies choose to locate in
a country,

206
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,450
or move to another country, for any one reason,

207
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,540
whether it's a tax break or politics, whatever
it is.

208
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,350
It doesn't happen for one reason.

209
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,290
And so, companies moving is likely a reflection

210
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,920
on their overall confidence in China.

211
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,779
So, the Chinese communist party

212
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,070
has a lot of control over the economy.

213
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,690
That's the whole point of a state-led economy.

214
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,889
What do you think the next thing they're going
to do

215
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,829
to tackle this falling economy?

216
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:24,279
So, the most recent rumors or news reports,

217
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,160
take them for what they are, involve, essentially,

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,720
more of the same.

219
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,690
They're going to increase local government
bond quotas,

220
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,070
that they're going to push investment.

221
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,420
It will be interesting to see,

222
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,930
they've made some concessions about opening
up markets

223
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,140
to foreign financial service providers.

224
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,810
It will be very interesting to see because,

225
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,810
as in China,

226
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,810
they can change the rules,

227
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,050
and nothing changes at the end of the day.

228
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,829
So, it will be very interesting to see how
that plays out.

229
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,490
I think what it, what is notable is, to me,

230
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,529
as I look at these changes, and what I see
are,

231
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,680
first of all, more of the same,

232
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,829
like increasing the local government bond
issuance quota.

233
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,690
That's basically just allowing local governments

234
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,660
to issue more debt this year.

235
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,990
We're in October and they've already exceeded
the quota for the year,

236
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,339
and so, they're going to allow them to issue
more.

237
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,570
So, it seems like part of it is more of the
same,

238
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,300
which is not a good recipe.

239
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,800
And, I think what is concerning is,

240
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,060
is that they're still trying

241
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,550
to fiddle around the edges as Rome burns,

242
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,830
for lack of a better term.

243
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,690
What do you mean by that?

244
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,459
There are very large, systemic,

245
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,200
fundamental problems with the Chinese economy

246
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,100
and they're just not dealing with them.

247
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,459
And so, increasing the local government bond
quota for the year

248
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,740
is going to put a bandaid over a gunshot wound.

249
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,699
It's not going to fundamentally address the
problem.

250
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,889
And, I think that is the problem

251
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,709
they just still don't want to face up to.

252
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,839
Well, you said they're doing more of the same.

253
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,680
They've been doing this for years,

254
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,690
and people have been saying the Chinese economy

255
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,350
is going to collapse for more than a decade
now,

256
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,320
but more of the same has kept the economy
working.

257
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,170
So, will this work?

258
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,440
Well, it depends on what you mean by work.

259
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,720
I think one of the things is in...

260
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,850
I have a good friend that gave me this theory,

261
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,430
which I've been increasingly leaning in this
direction,

262
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,180
is that as long as they continue increasing
the money supply,

263
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,000
debt, continue building things,

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,560
even if nobody necessarily lives in those
buildings, e

265
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,290
ven if those office spaces aren't occupied,

266
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,529
things like that.

267
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,470
What their goal is they need to keep growth
going.

268
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,520
Well, to prevent any real risk to their goal
of build,

269
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,779
build, build, even if nobody's going to live
there,

270
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,830
they have to, basically, essentially,

271
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,270
begin closing themselves off more and more,

272
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,870
because that is going to lower the risk of
debt problems,

273
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,830
that's going to lower the risk of currency
problems. Okay?

274
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,490
And, I think that's what we're seeing

275
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,399
within the Chinese economy right now.

276
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,670
That is their growth model.

277
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,290
They have to continue doing that.

278
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,699
And, I think we're going to continue to see

279
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,089
a further closed-off China from the rest of
the world.

280
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,010
And so, if the Chinese economy does collapse,

281
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,260
what does that mean for the Chinese communist
party?

282
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,040
Well, I've always been of the opinion

283
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,149
that I don't like to talk about a Chinese
collapse

284
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:53,810
or financial crisis, for multiple reasons,

285
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,610
but I think one of the most fundamentalist

286
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,300
as to why I don't like that type of terminology

287
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,550
is that the Chinese communist party,

288
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,980
and to answer your question, the Chinese communist
party

289
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,590
has a very fundamental interest in making
sure that

290
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,339
there is never a financial crisis

291
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,470
or significant economic problem.

292
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,459
Their entire governance campaign slogan is
on economic management.

293
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,560
"We will give you a better standard of living,

294
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
and you have to accept these trade-offs."

295
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,839
And so, if there ever is a serious economic
problem,

296
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,550
it's probably not going to end well for the
CCP.

297
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,510
And so, this tells us,

298
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,589
and I think this fits pretty closely with
what we see empirically,

299
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:43,480
is that there is no bailout too big. Okay?

300
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,320
There is no check that they will not write
to say,

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,431
"We'll just sweep this under the rug some
way,

302
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,480
well we're merge it into another company.

303
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,630
We will set up a bad bank to buy out these
assets.",

304
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,630
something like that,

305
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,899
"So that we can keep the plate spinning.

306
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,759
So that we can keep it going."

307
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,149
And so, that tells us, the analogy that I've
heard

308
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,430
is that they will be very happy to be, essentially,

309
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,769
the way I would describe it is,

310
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,139
North Korea with a higher level of income.

311
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,180
And, I think that seems to be more

312
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,530
and more the way that the world is moving.

313
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,779
What happens to the rest of the world

314
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,850
if China can't make a bigger bailout.

315
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,530
Well, it depends on which it is.

316
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,360
If it's within China, the world will probably
say,

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
"That's your problem."

318
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,600
Okay? If it's a steel company in a Heilongjiang,

319
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,580
the rest of the world's probably going to
say,

320
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,959
"Okay. Hey, have fun with that." Okay?

321
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,100
The real risk, and I think you are seeing
real pressure in this now,

322
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,540
is if there is some type of US dollar-denominated
bond issuance

323
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,310
that they cannot repay for some reason,

324
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,610
and especially if it's some type of local
government,

325
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,829
because what that would do is that would cause
a lot of investors,

326
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,340
especially those that don't pay a lot of attention
to China,

327
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,520
they think of local government as almost sovereign-level
debt.

328
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,440
And so, if some of these companies started

329
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,149
being unable to replay their US dollar liabilities,

330
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,329
all of a sudden you have bankers that would
say,

331
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,329
"Well, wait a minute,

332
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,160
we're not going to buy those US dollar-denominated
Chinese bonds."

333
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,060
All of a sudden, there's a lot of US dollar
tightness.

334
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,199
All of a sudden, they're going to have trouble
buying imports.

335
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,070
All of a sudden, it becomes a much bigger
problem very quickly.

336
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,529
And, at that point, the world would take notice
very rapidly,

337
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,399
and it would put a lot of risk on the CCP.

338
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,500
Well, so what would that mean for your average
American?

339
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,190
It depends. So, with the flows that we've
seen

340
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,259
into a firm like US pension funds into bond
indexes,

341
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,810
that's specifically by Chinese debt, and in
US dollars,

342
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,269
it could mean that they would see

343
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,720
some type of drop to their pension or 401k.

344
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,710
That's a distinct possibility.

345
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,730
Generally speaking,

346
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,320
because it would probably be chaos in the
markets,

347
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,210
for lack of a better term.

348
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:27,420
In reality, the amount of exports to China
as a part of total GDP

349
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,200
are not large for the United States.

350
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,410
So, it probably would, would not have as significant
an impact

351
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,060
as other potential major financial and economic
events.

352
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,830
Well, thanks for joining me.

353
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,270
That was absolutely fascinating.

354
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,510
Thank you very much for having me, Chris.

355
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,160
Appreciate it.
