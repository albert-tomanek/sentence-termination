1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,040
A Chinese soldier gets lost

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,320
And India finds him

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
Plus China’s hostage diplomacy

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
And what can the CCP do to find love?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,360
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,960
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
India captured a Chinese\h
soldier along a disputed border.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,080
The Chinese corporal apparently got lost.\h

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:43,840
I believe we have footage of the capture.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,040
Yeah okay, that works.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,160
This disputed border between India and\h
China has been causing a lot of grief.\h\h

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,600
Earlier this year, Chinese\h
soldiers killed 20 Indian soldiers.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,920
So at last, a chance for revenge!\h

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,240
“The Indian troops fed the\h
captured Chinese soldier a meal.\h\h

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
They gave him oxygen and some warm clothes.”

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,200
And then, they returned him.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,960
I guess the Indian army is going with the\h
“kill them with kindness” form of revenge.\h

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,400
According to the PLA, the soldier got lost “while\h
helping local herdsmen search for missing yaks.”

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,040
Wow, this is a rare story where everyone comes\h
out looking good. Congratulations everyone.\h

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,960
I hope China will treat the Americans it's\h
threatening to kidnap as nicely as the Indian\h\h

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,440
soldiers treated the PLA soldier. Because China\h
is now actually threatening to detain Americans.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,080
That’s because the US has recently arrested\h
at least 5 Chinese scholars—scholars\h\h

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,560
who broke the law by not disclosing their\h
military affiliations on their visa applications.\h\h

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
And they may have been spying\h
on US research centers.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,280
The US State Department would just like to remind\h
Americans about its travel advisory on China.\h\h

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,320
Which they updated back in September to Level 3:\h\h

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,440
Reconsider Travel, “due to COVID-19 and\h
arbitrary enforcement of local laws”.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,040
And they specifically call out the risk of\h
arbitrary and wrongful detentions in China and the\h\h

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,840
use of exit bans. Exit bans are when you’re not\h
actually imprisoned, but you can’t leave China.\h

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,520
Meanwhile China obviously denies that report. And\h
says the US is mistreating the Chinese scholars.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
So if you’re an American in China,\h\h

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
should you be worried? We’ll have more on\h
that in a future episode, so stay tuned.\h

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,400
But China’s “hostage diplomacy” is nothing new.\h

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,240
At the end of 2018, China detained two Canadians,\h\h

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\h
That was in retaliation for Canada\h\h

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,360
arresting the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou. She\h
was accused of violating US sanctions on Iran.\h

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Canada still has not been able to\h
get China to release their citizens.\h\h

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,160
At a high level UN Security\h
Council Meeting this week,\h\h

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,280
colleagues of the two detained men appealed\h
directly to China for their release.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,600
That happened just a few days after\h
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\h\h

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
said Canada won’t stop calling\h
for human rights in China.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,160
He said that because the Chinese ambassador\h
to Canada warned Canada not to accept Hong\h\h

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,400
Kong refugees. “He said that could have\h
consequences for the ‘health and security’\h\h

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,840
for the 300,000 Canadians living in the\h
theoretically autonomous Chinese territory.”

46
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,000
So...he’s threatening that if Canada\h
tries to make Hong Kong people safe,\h\h

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
China will make Canadians in Hong Kong less safe.\h

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,120
Yeah, it sounds like appealing\h
directly to China to release\h\h

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
the two Canadian Michaels is\h
probably not going to work.\h

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Meanwhile, US diplomats in China are\h
being monitored by the Communist Party.\h\h

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,200
According to leaked documents\h
obtained by the Epoch Times,\h\h

52
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,880
“Chinese authorities see U.S. Consulates as\h
‘hostile forces’ that conduct ‘infiltration\h\h

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,920
and sabotage’ activities on Chinese soil and have\h
ordered officials to monitor key U.S. diplomats.”

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,920
Although, I’m going to go out on a\h
limb and say that US diplomats in China\h\h

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
probably already know they’re being monitored.\h

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
According to one leaked document, which is\h
from 2018, the Chinese Communist Party was\h\h

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,480
especially concerned with “blocking [the\h
consulates] from establishing connections\h\h

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,400
with key [Chinese] political\h
figures, prominent lawyers,\h\h

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
‘public intellectuals,’ ‘rights\h
defenders,’ and special interest groups”

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,040
How did Party officials plan to stop that from\h
happening? The document advised officials to\h\h

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,000
“‘Use all efforts’—including ‘reminders,\h
warnings, and a mild degree of force’”\h\h

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to stop those people from being able to\h
attend events held by the US consulates.

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,040
Hey, what’s wrong with using a mild\h
degree of force on your own citizens?\h\h

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
It’s for their own good!\h

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
And we’ll be back with more news after the break.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Welcome back.

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,280
China has passed an export control law after\h
the US did the same to China last month.

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
“[The] controlled items include\h
military and nuclear products,\h\h

69
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
as well as other goods, technologies\h
and services and relevant data.”

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
You know, all the things the US so\h
desperately relies on China for.\h

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,720
Meanwhile, China is also forcing Chinese\h
textiles to stop using Australian cotton.

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,760
That follows similar action on\h
Australian beef and coal. Now some might\h\h

73
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,960
call this a trade war, which\h
would be totally unoriginal.\h\h

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,240
And I wouldn’t want to accuse the Chinese regime\h
of just copying things that other countries do.

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
As my favorite Chinese state-run media,\h
the Global Times says “Such groundless\h\h

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,280
speculation by Western media outlets is a clear\h
reflection of [the Australian government’s]\h\h

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,280
hostility toward China and its attempt to\h
push China to import more Australia cotton.”

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,640
I mean sure China’s ban on Australian imports\h
will hurt Australian farmers in the short run.\h\h

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,640
But that’s not China’s fault.\h
According to the Global Times,\h\h

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,520
this is simply the result of market competition.

81
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,360
And the Chinese Communist Party\h
is all about the free market.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,520
And not to worry, because China can get\h
all the cotton it needs from Xinjiang—where\h\h

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,320
forced labor is just part of\h
China’s incredibly free market.

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,560
Hey, it’s just a mild degree of\h
forced labor. It’s for their own good!

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
Sweden has banned Chinese telecom companies Huawei\h\h

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
and ZTE because they’re\h
controlled by the Chinese state.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,360
But that’s just the beginning of what\h
happened in the past week around the world.

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,840
In a virtual summit with Brazil,\h
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\h\h

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
said the two countries need to reduce\h
their dependence on imports from China.

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,600
And now Brazil is saying it won’t buy\h
a Chinese made coronavirus vaccine.

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,880
The US also blacklisted two Chinese men and six\h
Chinese entities for violating sanctions on Iran.

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,120
And that comes on top of a US\h
warning to international banks\h\h

93
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,760
about violating US sanctions on Hong Kong.

94
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,840
I don’t get it. It’s like the world is for some\h
reason afraid of the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

95
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
What more can the Communist\h
Party do to make people love it?

96
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,880
Wait, I know, you catch more flies\h
with honey than vinegar right?\h\h

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,840
China can just sell us some\h
sweeteners! It's the perfect plan.

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Except the US had to go and seize\h
imports of a Chinese sweetener,\h\h

99
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
just because China used a little\h
bit of free market slave labor.

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
The US government found that a\h
Chinese company in Inner Mongolia\h\h

101
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,040
was producing the sweetener\h
stevia using prison labor.\h

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,800
This was the first forced labor finding issued\h
by US Customs and Border Control since 1996.

103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,120
The US agency said that the finding “tells U.S.\h
importers who fail to eliminate forced labor from\h\h

104
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,080
their supply chains that their shipments\h
may be subject to seizure and forfeiture.”

105
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,480
But what if it was just a\h
mild degree of forced labor?\h

106
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,160
Given what we know about Chinese supply chains,\h
I have a feeling that the US government is\h\h

107
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,000
going to be doing a lot more of\h
these seizures in the future.\h

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,560
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,840
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

110
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,880
James Wallberg asks,\h\h

111
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,880
“Chris what will you and the China Uncensored\h
crew do after the CCP is overthrown?\h

112
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
Well, that will be a glorious day\h
when the CCP finally bites the dust.\h\h

113
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,400
At one point I would have said that as soon\h
as that happens, Matt, Shelley and I would fly\h\h

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,320
over to China and celebrate and see the sights.\h
I’d say we more than earned a little vacation.\h

115
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
But then we started our\h
other show America Uncovered.\h\h

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
And judging by how things are in the\h
US, I don’t think we’ll ever get a\h\h

117
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,840
chance to retire. If you haven’t yet, please\h
subscribe to America Uncovered on YouTube.

118
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
Thanks for your question James.

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,960
And if you’d like to have me respond to\h
your question or comment on the show for\h\h

120
