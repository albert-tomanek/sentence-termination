1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,060
Pandas!

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,110
Lovable?

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,160
Cute?

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,630
Or Loveable and Cute?

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,240
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,760
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,340
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,000
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,780
Big news today folks.

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,970
A panda born in America is heading to China!

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,420
There’s nothing bigger or more important
in China news!

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,260
“It's time to say goodbye to Bei Bei.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,570
The National Zoo's beloved giant panda Bei
Bei,

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,230
has reached the age of four years old and
that means,

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,250
per tradition,

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,100
it's time to move from Washington DC to China.”

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,130
Oh hi Bei Bei Boy,

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,559
everyone loves pandas right?

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,220
They even made this special cake for him.

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,640
Course no one made a special cake for me.

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Even when it was my birthday, Shelley!

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,730
Bei Bei even got to fly to China in first
class on the Panda Express.

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,519
Yes, that panda got to fly better than you
ever will.

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,469
And he’ll have a lot to look forward to
back in China.

25
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,479
Like people smelling his poop.

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,060
Ha ha, golly!

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,890
Well, thanks for watching China Uncensored,

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,700
once again I’m Chris Chappell,

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,729
see you next time.

30
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,850
Okay, have the YouTube censors clicked off?

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,260
Good!

32
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,740
Stupid pandas.

33
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
Sorry everyone,

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,999
YouTube has been soft censoring all our critical
China content,

35
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,029
so I’m trying to throw them off the scent.

36
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,359
With panda poop.

37
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,420
Oh, be sure to comment below about how much
you love China.

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,599
The YouTube censor bots might check the comments,
too.

39
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,999
See, the only reason China Uncensored is still
on the air is

40
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,880
because viewers like you contribute

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,880
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,450
If it weren’t for that,

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,219
YouTube would have run us out of business
years ago.

44
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,819
So if you can, and you’re like me

45
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,819
and you don’t really want to hear about
pandas,

46
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,249
head over to Patreon.com/chinauncensored.

47
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:05,359
Okay, on to the real China news.

48
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,880
Guess what?

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,290
China isn’t all pandas.

50
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,210
The New York Times published 400 pages of
leaked internal documents

51
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,240
about the crackdown on ethnic minorities in
Xinjiang.

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,320
Over a million people in Xinjiang, most ethnic
Uighurs,

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,000
are in what are essentially concentration
camps.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,790
In an internal speech, which these documents
reveal,

55
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,460
Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for an all-out
“struggle against terrorism,

56
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,090
infiltration and separatism” using the “organs
of dictatorship,”

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,160
and showing “absolutely no mercy.”

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Yeah, Xi loves to whip out his organ of dictatorship.

59
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,730
That’s the kind of thing you won’t hear
on Panda Uncensored.

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,300
Not only that, but documents instruct Chinese
police

61
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,940
to tell children of detained Uighurs that
if they speak out,

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,580
their parents will be kept even longer in
those concentration camps.

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,770
I mean, um, training centers.

64
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,990
Obviously the Chinese Communist Party

65
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,330
was not too pleased about the leak.

66
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,030
Xinjiang authorities said,

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,750
“America’s New York Times has again fabricated

68
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,360
and concocted fake news about Xinjiang.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,700
This is nothing more than getting up to its
old tricks,

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,070
and is completely unworthy of refutation.”

71
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,130
Which is a great line.

72
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,819
Because they can’t refute it.

73
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,650
China is gearing up for America’s 2020 presidential
elections.

74
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,280
They’re practicing by interfering in Taiwan’s
2020 presidential elections.

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,210
“China intervening in our elections is not
something

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,790
that happens on one or two days, that's very
clear.

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,040
This is more or less the consensus of Taiwan's
people.

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,940
China is using various means to intervene

79
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,310
in Taiwan's election to damage our democracy.”

80
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,210
Taiwan’s elections are in January.

81
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,860
And the Chinese Communist Party wants to make
sure

82
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,580
someone friendly to Beijing gets elected.

83
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,960
Just like it would like to make sure someone
friendly to Beijing

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,040
gets elected in the US in November 2020.

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,090
So the Party’s just getting a little practice
in ahead of time.

86
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,150
Last week, the US conducted a Freedom of Navigation
Operation

87
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,639
by sailing a warship through the Taiwan Strait.

88
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,829
And I made a joke about it.

89
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,000
“The US has sailed another warship through
the Taiwan Strait.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,729
Which honestly is kind of a mixed signal.

91
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,199
It shows that the US is ready to defend their
ally.

92
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,810
But it also means that if the US

93
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,919
can sail a warship through the Taiwan Strait,

94
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,030
China can too.”

95
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,699
Well, obviously China’s military does not
understand jokes.

96
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,439
A few days later, they *did* sail their own
warship through the Taiwan Strait.

97
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,870
This is exactly the kind of situation could
spiral out of control.

98
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,009
But don’t worry, I know just what to say:

99
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,289
“Hey, Chinese military!

100
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,729
Wouldn’t it be funny if you didn’t try
to invade Taiwan?

101
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,590
That would show ’em!”

102
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,520
This month marks 15 years since the publication
of the book

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,279
the Chinese Communist Party hates more than
anything:

104
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,620
The Nine Commentaries on the Chinese Communist
Party.

105
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,539
It basically lays out all the dirty secrets
of the Party’s rise to power

106
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,879
and the bloody grip it’s kept on China for
the past 70 years.

107
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,419
The book was immediately banned.

108
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,240
And then it sparked a movement where millions
of people inside China

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,409
have publicly severed their ties to the Communist
Party.

110
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:31,720
It’s a fun read.

111
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,669
I’ve provided a link below to the English
translation.

112
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,169
A phase one trade deal between the US and
China

113
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,129
is looking pretty elusive right now.

114
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,349
But apparently, that doesn’t bother President
Trump.

115
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,279
Look, China's going to have to make a deal
that I like.

116
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,279
If they don't, that's it...

117
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,189
If we don't make a deal with China,

118
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,479
I'll just raise the tariffs even higher.

119
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,120
Thank you very much."

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,880
And Elvis has left the building.

121
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,550
Of course, the changes Trump wants—

122
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,620
no more theft of American technology, no more
currency manipulation, etc—

123
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,900
the Communist Party is never going to agree
to those.

124
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,990
I mean, if you’re a Communist regime,

125
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,160
you lie and cheat.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,759
It’s what you do.

127
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,229
That’s why some people have said the US

128
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,219
should completely decouple the US and Chinese
economies.

129
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,669
A lot of people already see that as inevitable.

130
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,460
But the Trump Administration has publicly
said

131
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,669
that they do not want to decouple the US and
Chinese economies.

132
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,809
Not that Trump would ever change his mind,
or anything.

133
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:35,189
Another case of the bubonic plague has been
reported in China.

134
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,020
This is only the third official case.

135
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,220
A hunter got it from eating a wild rabbit.

136
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,800
But people are concerned the problem could
be much larger,

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,569
since China has a history of covering up epidemic
outbreaks.

138
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,180
I mean, if you can’t stop the disease,

139
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,589
at least you can stop all that media coverage.

140
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:58,129
Australia is ending a multi-million dollar
human rights partnership with China.

141
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,729
My first thought was,

142
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,379
Australia had a human rights partnership with
China?!

143
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,169
But China sits on the UN’s Human Rights
Council,

144
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,979
so I’ll just say, at least Australia wised
up.

145
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,840
I hope Germany will do the same,

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,349
and stop aiding the Chinese military.

147
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,379
That’s another one of those things you wouldn’t
think was happening,

148
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,330
but yes, it turns out there’s a lot of stupidity
out there.

149
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,219
A spokesman for Germany’s Defense Ministry
said,

150
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,559
“Our goal is to share our democratic values

151
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,460
with citizens of other countries.”

152
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,259
By training Chinese soldiers.

153
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,930
I...really don’t see how that works.

154
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,319
But at least it’s better than Greece.

155
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,270
China has been making big inroads in Greece.

156
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,680
Earlier this month,

157
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,219
Greek police detained Falun Gong practitioners

158
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,199
while Chinese leader Xi Jinping was in town.

159
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,810
Now to be clear, they were not protesting.

160
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,439
They were just meditating in a park,

161
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,159
because that’s what Falun Gong practitioners
do.

162
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,939
I mean, Greece is a free country.

163
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,069
Except when Xi Jinping is in town.

164
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,599
The United States is withdrawing from the
Paris Climate Agreement.

165
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,089
And now people are all like,

166
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,400
oh China’s going to be a world climate change
leader!

167
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,410
And they’re right!

168
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,110
China is a world leader in climate change.

169
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,590
Not the good kind.

170
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,749
The kind that’s leading the world in CO2
emissions.

171
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,219
Yes, China is number one!

172
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,750
But just to make sure no one else catches
up,

173
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,270
China is ramping up coal usage even more.

174
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,909
In fact, China’s new coal power plants

175
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,520
are equal to the entire capacity of the EU.

176
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,900
Now that sounds bad.

177
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,940
But wait, I heard that China has saved

178
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,760
hundreds of thousands of lives by reducing
air pollution.

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
How does that make any sense?

180
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
Well, what the CNN headline neglects to mention
is that study was done...

181
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,220
by Chinese scientists.

182
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,040
Awesome.

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,660
If you want to learn more about the Paris Climate Agreement,

184
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,400
watch the episode we did earlier this week on our other channel, America Uncovered.

185
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,640
And that does it for this week’s China News
headlines.

186
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,910
Now it’s time for me to respond to one of
those fans

187
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,970
that supports the show on Patreon.

188
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,710
Banana Pancakes asks,

189
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,950
“I think folks that are part of the 50-cent
army

190
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,130
should have the China Uncensored theme music
as their ring tone...

191
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,340
like a secret handshake but more musical

192
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,230
Well, I think that’s a great idea!

193
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,660
If you pledge $5 to the show,

194
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,490
you get access to the music from China Uncensored.

195
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,810
This is one of the tracks.

196
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,550
So sign up to support the show,

197
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,250
download all this great music,

198
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,590
and make it your ring tone.

199
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,570
Troll the Chinese Communist Party every time
you get a call.

200
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,340
Thanks Banana Pancakes for the idea.
