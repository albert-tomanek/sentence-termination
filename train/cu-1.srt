1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,150
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,340
the Chinese Communist Party may be atheist,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,360
but that doesn’t mean they don’t want
to be worshipped.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,990
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,080
Do you feel it, brothers and sisters?

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,940
Do you feel the spirit move within you?

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,550
The spirit of...

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,900
socialism with Chinese characteristics?

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,900
You see,

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,900
there’s a new preacher in town,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,460
and his name is Xi Jinping.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,260
And he’s leading the Great China Revival,

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,440
or as he calls it,

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,390
national rejuvenation.

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,820
“Advance the new project of party building

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,280
as well as striving for Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,760
for the New Era and realizing

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,950
the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation."

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,360
Praise be to Xi!

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
It’s a new era.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,450
So get rid of your pictures of Jesus—

23
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,120
he’s not gonna save you—

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,330
and put up this photo of Xi Jinping.

25
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,920
No, seriously.

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,280
Take down your pictures of Jesus

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,660
and put up one of Xi

28
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,030
or else lose your social services.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,660
That’s what Chinese Christians are being
told

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,340
in some really poor parts of China.

31
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,930
Yes, local Communist officials in southeastern
China

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,210
say they’ve been “melting the hard ice

33
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,890
in the hearts of religious believers”

34
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,530
and “helping turn them into believers in
the party.”

35
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,510
Just look at them go.

36
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,830
One local official said,

37
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,130
“Many rural people are ignorant.

38
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,420
They think God is their savior.

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,130
After our cadres’ work,

40
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,200
they’ll realize their mistakes and think:

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,659
We should no longer rely on Jesus,

42
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,939
but on the party for help.”

43
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,080
Who needs spiritual beliefs when you can

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,640
always turn to your loving totalitarian government?

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,009
Seriously, who needs spiritual beliefs?

46
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,579
Write down their names and report them.

47
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,869
And really, who wouldn’t want

48
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,240
this wonderfully flattering portrait of Xi
Jinping

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
on their wall?

50
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,730
I didn’t know that Xi was a fan of Meitu.

51
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,340
In fact, that airbrushing is so good

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,750
I should really get my own version.

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,560
Ok, so there’s no way to know whether or
not

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,530
this is sanctioned by Xi Jinping

55
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,209
or if it’s just some overzealous local officials

56
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,950
trying to curry favor.

57
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,810
But morality is coming back to China.

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,040
And it will be guided by the most moral body
of all:

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
The Communist Party.

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,200
Kind of like when your elephant sanctuary

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,700
is run by Ivory Dealers R Us.

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,510
I hear they’re starting one

63
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,059
for white rhinos on the side.

64
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:30,420
Ok, so learning morality from an authoritarian
regime

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,209
that’s killed tens of millions of your people

66
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,749
and almost completely destroyed

67
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,969
the moral and spiritual underpinnings of your
culture

68
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,939
might seem a little dicey.

69
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,569
But the idea that China needs a moral revival

70
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,900
is not new.

71
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,090
According to this survey

72
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,959
by research firm Ipsos,

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,620
a shocking 47% of Chinese people

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,180
rank moral decline

75
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,140
as one of China’s top three problems.

76
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,680
More than in any other country.

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,590
But worry not, my good Christian...

78
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,959
I mean, my good communist brothers and sisters.

79
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,329
Because the Chinese Communist Party has released,

80
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,699
not just 10 commandments,

81
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,519
but 68 commandments.

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,989
As part of China’s great moral revival,

83
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:12,989
over the summer,

84
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,569
China’s online entertainment industry

85
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,629
was sent a new censorship directive.

86
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,590
They banned 68 different topics.

87
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,769
Including things like underage drinking,

88
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,680
gambling, extreme violence,

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,260
scantily clad people,

90
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,069
and satirizing spiritual figures and beliefs.

91
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,310
But this kind of thing has been happening
all year.

92
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,430
An update to the official state run media
style guide

93
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,370
banned a bunch of new words,

94
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,180
along with crude language and online slang.

95
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,470
But along with crude online slang,

96
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,199
media are banned from using terms like

97
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,819
“Taiwan government” or “Taiwan presidential
elections.”

98
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,400
Nope, those are “leader elections in the
region of Taiwan.”

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,209
Just rolls off the tongue.

100
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,150
In addition, textbooks have been purged of
immoral values.

101
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,760
As in, Western values.

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,860
And celebrity gossip blogs have also been
shut down.

103
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,349
But before you start thinking that,

104
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,209
“Maybe the CCP is on the right track

105
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,430
with banning celebrity gossip,”

106
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,579
just remember that it comes as part of the
overall

107
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,449
no-one-gets-free-speech package.

108
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,300
I mean, this is the same CCP that in 1999,

109
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,960
started killing people who practiced Falun
Gong mediation because—

110
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,630
as state-run Xinhua put it—

111
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,330
“The so-called ‘truth, kindness and tolerance’
principle

112
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,759
preached by [Falun Gong founder] Li Hongzhi

113
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,389
has nothing in common with the socialist ethical

114
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,080
and cultural progress we are striving to achieve.”

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,270
And while other spiritual believers are also
getting in trouble...

116
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,080
You’d better not believe in anything if
you’re a Party member.

117
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,139
Other than the Party, I mean.

118
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,419
So the church of the Communist Party

119
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,130
will be light on kindness,

120
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,860
and heavy on Xi Jinping Thought.

121
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
And the truth is,

122
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,639
there’s not going to be a lot of tolerance

123
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,759
unless you start putting up those posters.

124
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,759
So what do you think of China’s moral revival

125
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,719
at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party?

126
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,650
