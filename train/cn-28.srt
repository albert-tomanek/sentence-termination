00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,600
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,240
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,560
Well, I'm cock-a-hoop.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,680
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,760
This is a public service announcement.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,200
These public services are closed.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,360
Please use the nearest toilets
on the other side of the concourse.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,760
In front of me I've got an article
from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,040
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,440
And there's a special prize
for particularly good answers which is...

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,040
And today we are talking about
the Battle of Fishguard.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,200
Is a Fishguard a shield?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,680
Yes, they hold it in their little... hands.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
Good luck with this one, Gary.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,440
-Oh, s***.
-We have started well.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,960
I meant the battlers, what are they called,
warriors? Let's call them warriors.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,880
Were they warriors holding up fish as shields,
the Fishguard?

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
What, like a flatfish and then a swordfish
in the other hand?

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,240
Oh!

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Squelching your way forward and making a…

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,520
Now, that's a proper combination.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,720
Yeah, or a pike.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,840
Oh!

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,120
F*** you.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
No, is the answer to all of that,
I'll just shut that down immediately.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm going to say Wales.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
Yes, and have a point.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
It's a place?

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,040
Yes, yeah, I learnt it in a Beano annual.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,480
I learned it from the shipping forecast.

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Well, there we go,
we all have different routes to education(!)

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,720
This isn't one, by the way.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah, well you'll say at the end,
"that taught me a lesson."

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,080
-Hey!
-Ah.

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,080
-Beano annual?
-Well, up yours then.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,600
The Fishguard is as place in Wales
and this is where the battle took place.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,560
No, f***, really?

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,240
They named the battle after where it happened,

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
unlike all the other battle naming conventions,
which were a good 50 miles away.

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
Just to confuse the future tourists.

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah, it's like in World War 2
when they switched the road signs round.

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,800
That's a fair point, Battle and actual site of the
Battle of Hastings is debatable for instance.

45
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,080
So yeah, it has been done.

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,040
Battle of Waterloo, you can see the remains
in Waterloo Station to this day.

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
That's true, you wouldn't have thought
they'd have it so close to London, would you?

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
I know.

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
It's just a Friday night before Christmas
and everyone's trying to get north, it's just…

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,440
That's when Abba fell out.

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
When you're ready.

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Oh, they've turned.

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,400
-They've turned, they've turned.
-It's a poor audience.

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,760
This was a battle in Fishguard,
who might have been attacking and when?

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
-Fishermen.
-Actually is it a Cod War?

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,920
-I was going to go for trawlermen, yeah.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,720
Oh no, no, it's a little early for trawlers.

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,640
So it wasn’t an uprising,
oh, was it Vikings?

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
It's a little late for Vikings.

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
So it's somewhere between
Vikings and the advent of modern fishing.

61
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,760
Where we sit the best.

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,560
Well, using my extensive historical knowledge…

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm bracing myself, carry on.

64
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,960
It's not Victorian.

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,040
-What!
-That was the only other time period I know.

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm going to go 13th century.

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,040
No, it's… it's much later,
this was during the War of the First Coalition.

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,880
Well, is that...
 political joke incoming,

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,640
Is that somewhere around about 2010?

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This was 1792 to 1797,
who might Britain have been battling then?

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
-Virtually everybody.
-Yes.

72
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,080
Tom, does the wheel spin and land,
as it does 50% of the time, on France?

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Playing the hits, ladies and gentlemen!

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
"We are coming for you."

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,080
This was an attempt to land
a force of French troops in Britain

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,480
to support another invasion.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,960
So they went via Wales?

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,840
-Yes.
-The soft underbelly of England.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,520
So where might have been the
primary attack force headed?

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
-Ireland?
-Yes.

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, hang on.

82
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,880
Because Wales, boat wise,
is on the way to Ireland, isn't it?

83
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Sure!

84
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Well, because if you're boating
from the France bit,

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,760
you get to the Wales bit
before you get to the Ireland bit, don't you?

86
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,560
If you're coming the right,
top right bit of France?

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes.

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
-He's… he's not wrong.
-It often depends

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,240
on which direction you're heading,
I suppose, doesn't it, yeah.

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
-The top left.
-No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,160
So what was this invasion force intended to do?

92
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Invade.

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
That is technically a correct answer.

94
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,280
This was a third attempt at invasion,
why did some of the earlier ones fail?

95
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,320
Far too windy.

96
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

97
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
That's what you get
for having beans on the journey.

98
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,360
"Oh, mais oui, le bilious..."

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,160
"Le windy-pop, c'est grande."

100
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,880
So the Wales-bound invasion force,
1400 troops from the Black Legion.

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh, "la Légion noire"!

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,880
Under the command of an Irish American,
Colonel William Tate.

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,640
Was it the Black Legion from our side?

104
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,200
No, this is... well, I'm translating,
La Légion noire.

105
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
-Sorry, Tate rings a bell.
-It does actually.

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,920
Did they… did they invade with art?

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,400
Tate.

108
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
No, it actually wasn't recent enough
for modern art.

109
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,640
Who clapped?

110
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,440
Just once as well, which...

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Thank you. Well, we're going to arrange it

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,400
so each person takes a single clap at each joke,
and on average...

113
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,080
Is one clap a greater degree of shade...?

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,040
1400 troops invading Wales, essentially.

115
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,560
And did anyone ask the Welsh,
were they alright with this?

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,880
It sounds dreadfully rude.

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,040
Well, you say that,  there was a bit of
response when 1400 troops arrived.

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
What were these troops made up of?

119
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Horses?

120
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,600
Cavalry.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, infantry.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Horses riding men.
That was a real diversionary tactic.

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,880
600 were regular soldiers that Napoleon
had not required to conquer Italy.

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
So the B team?

125
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, 800 were irregulars,
now what does that mean?

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Slight factory seconds.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Maybe some chips in the glaze but still useful.

128
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,120
Irregulars are paid mercenaries, aren't they?

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,760
Not quite.

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Conscripts.

131
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,080
Again, not... not quite, it's more general.

132
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,320
So they're a special force
but not in an SAS kind of way?

133
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,200
Yeah, just in, there's something different
about these folk.

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,720
They're special. They're special as in you
wouldn't trust them with anything important?

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
-Yes.
-Right.

136
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
-So we have…
-This is good.

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,840
We have the B team and we have the irregulars.

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,920
And actually I am going to give you a point
because it includes:

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,840
republicans, deserters, convicts
and royalist prisoners.

140
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,680
Nice. Now, at least that last category is probably
not going to be that up for this, would I imagine?

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,320
Are they going to choose this
as a running away opportunity?

142
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah, you know what, that's a point.

143
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Discipline broke down
amongst the irregulars on landing.

144
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,200
What a delightful euphemism.

145
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,080
Discipline broke down amongst these prisoners
that we tried to order into doing something.

146
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,160
"And no naughty running away while you're at it,
I want you all here by teatime, you understand?

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,280
"You're on your honour."

148
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,920
And yes, they did indeed desert;
where and why might they have deserted?

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,320
Because they're being forced to do things
against their will in a foreign nation.

150
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Oh, but very specifically
they went to try and do something.

151
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,800
Cocktail bars.

152
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,320
Did they just want some fish and chips and they
found a place on the map called Fishplace

153
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
or whatever it was called?

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,480
I mean it wasn't so much they were paying
for the fish and chips.

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
Did they steal fish and chips?

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,880
-They just went looting?
-That is exactly the right word, yes, they…

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,840
They're robbers, they'll just go looting!

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
Yes.

159
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,840
"You mean these people who we've arrested
for stealing,

160
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,280
"we've let them go of their own free will,
are stealing again?"

161
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,120
Let's not forget, we've given them rifles!

162
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,280
The set up for the battle, if you like.

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't know what, there is probably a formal term
for the armies amassing themselves

164
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
and getting ready to fight.

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,920
It is, it's the armies amassing themselves
and getting ready to fight.

166
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,840
The armies amassed themselves
and got ready to fight.

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
But that took a little while, so on the French
side they'd sort of taken over a few farmhouses.

168
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,960
What's happening in the British command?

169
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,200
Tea.

170
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
A social event is happening.

171
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,040
Oh, that's nice.

172
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,080
A messenger on horseback arrives
to instruct the commanding officer.

173
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,960
And the commanding officer was William Knox,
what was his immediate reaction?

174
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
"More brandy!"

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,800
Yes!

176
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,360
"We'll fight them in the morning...

177
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,640
"... lunchtime."

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
The thing is you're about right.

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,600
"Wednesday."

180
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,680
-The import…
-"I'm not done."

181
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,720
"Don't you interrupt an officer of the crown.

182
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,520
"Now you may speak."

183
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
-The import…
-"But not about that."

184
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,240
The import of this news
was slow to dawn on Knox.

185
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
"I don't know what you mean."

186
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
His initial reaction was "Really?"

187
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,480
The next title here is Battle Averted.

188
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,360
Ah.

189
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
So what happened?

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
A pint of rum for anybody who switches sides.

191
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh, you know what?

192
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,780
Two pints of rum for anybody who switches sides!

193
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,880
Mercy for anybody who switches s...

194
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,160
"Brandy for anybody who switches sides!"

195
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,520
F***ing something for f***ing switching sides
and some people did.

196
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,160
It's... it's not quite switching sides, is wh...

197
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,200
discipline among the recruits had collapsed
once they discovered the local supply of wine.

198
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
So they themselves were drunk.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,960
Why might there have been wine in Wales?

200
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
-Stolen.
-Medicinal?

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Stolen is close.

202
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
Stollen. The bready thing.

203
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
"This wine is German Christmas bread!

204
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
"I'll have none of it."

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
It was actually Portuguese wine.

206
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
-Washed up?
-Yes.

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
A Portuguese ship had been wrecked,
some wine had come ashore.

208
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,520
-Because they're on the lefty bit.
-Yes, where the boats go.

209
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,480
Where the boats all go.

210
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,800
So Portuguese's version of man o' war
probably sank.

211
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,280
And some bottles had washed up
that were full of probably port.

212
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
Well, that's gout-worthy, isn't it?

213
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
-You'd know.
-Y.. dammit!

214
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,200
The most painful thing that ever happened,
don't do it.

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,960
And I only wish I'd got it through better means.

216
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,840
While the British are marching in,
what's happening with the locals?

217
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,760
Are they rapidly sobering the French up to get
them to actually have this fight they fancied?

218
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,120
Chasing them out in…
with like comedy implements,

219
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,680
like people chasing them out
with rolling pins and s***?

220
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
You know what?

221
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
Mystery Biscuits.

222
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,800
The French are approaching,
the British under the command of Lord Cawdor,

223
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
whose HQ is where?

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Mordor.

225
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,120
It doesn't have to rhyme.

226
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,320
"Lord Cawdor of Mordor!"

227
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,280
"Lord Wellington of Hellington."

228
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,400
I mean, no, the local pub, the Royal Oak.

229
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,720
-Really?
-He set up in the pub, that was his HQ,

230
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
so he's taken his men from there.

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,400
It's a very drunken invasion on both sides, this.

232
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
But pubs could be used for official uses,
because they were like a community.

233
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,280
You often had inquests and things
that took place in the local pub.

234
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,560
Obviously not on the top of the bar,
that would be rude, but in an upstairs room.

235
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,120
So suddenly someone kicking the door in
and going, "mine now,"

236
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,320
they were probably quite used to it,
it could be used as courtrooms and things as well.

237
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
You'd just go over to the Winchester
and wait for it all to blow over.

238
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Pretty much.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,200
The French realised that the British
had more people than them.

240
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,640
So as the light fails,
they go back to their camps for the night.

241
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,720
The next morning, what happens at the pub?

242
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,520
Well, the British get up and realise that
there's nothing left in the pub

243
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,200
and therefore have to seek out things
like bacon sandwiches, possibly a McDonald's,

244
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,160
something like that,
just to get them over the night before.

245
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
-Who comes along to the pub?
-Do the French come along to the pub?

246
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes, two French officers turned up,
why would they do that?

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,880
They too were in search of bacon sandwiches,
possibly a McDonald's.

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Why do you send only two officers
to the opponent's HQ?

249
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Because one of them is a horse,
and has been riding on the back of the man.

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,520
He knocks on the door with his hooves.

251
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm looking for a specific word here.

252
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
Oh my… well, if we start at A.

253
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,680
They're negotiating the terms of…

254
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,400
Surrender!

255
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,960
-Surrender, absolutely, right, thank you,
sarcastic clap...

256
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Yes, I deserve that(!)

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,760
Insert French surrender joke here,
cutting room floor, there we go, there we go.

258
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah, they wish to negotiate a conditional
surrender and Lord Cawdor said?

259
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
-No.
-Yes.

260
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,880
I mean yes, you're right,
that's absolutely...so why did he say that?

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,240
Because he hadn't had a fight yet and he'd come
all this way and brought all those things.

262
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,720
And he was hungover and God damn it,
somebody was going to suffer.

263
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,200
And he's been knocked up early in the morning
by these bloody French already.

264
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,720
We're going to deal with them well after one,
he hasn’t got the papers with him or anything.

265
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,680
Does he not have the authority to accept it?

266
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
No, he absolutely has
the authority to accept it.

267
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,680
He just didn't want to?

268
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,520
Yes, why might he have done that, why might he
have turned away a conditional surrender,

269
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,960
and insisted that no,
it's got to be unconditional?

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,040
Saw an easy career promotion
with a crushing victory.

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,160
Oh, crushing victory is interesting.

272
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
-I was going to say...
-Crushing loss, I don't know.

273
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,880
A sly glance. An impropriety at
a society party. I don't f***ing know.

274
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,640
No, he... he was saying we can get
a crushing victory, essentially, to them.

275
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Was he getting a bonus if he won?

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,200
No, he was bluffing, he was flat out bluffing
that he had more people and more on the way,

277
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,320
and, 'If you don't surrender you will all die,
there are no conditions on this.'

278
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,040
"You can't come into the pub because it's
full of men, full of them you hear, full of them.

279
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,920
"Well, no you can't, you simply can't
come through the door.

280
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,720
"I can't accept your surrender,
there's far too many of us, bye.

281
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
"Well, lads."

282
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,520
And so there is some speculation here,

283
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,440
that he got a little bit of help from some people
looking on from the cliffs.

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
So what did the French see on the cliffs?

285
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
People?

286
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
Turn of the 18th century,

287
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,960
does anyone know what
a traditional Welsh costume looks like for women?

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Yes, the pointy hat and the little apron
and they tie it under your thing,

289
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,920
and then, yeah, yeah, like that,
you look like a little Welshwoman,

290
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
on all the spoons that they sell
at the seaside resorts.

291
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,120
They sell spoons, alright,
they have Welsh ladies on them.

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll give you the point,
it's a top hat and a red dress.

293
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah.

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,240
Now, if you're looking at someone far away
on the top of a cliff…

295
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Oh s***, he didn't think he'd seen
more soldiers, did he?

296
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Yes.

297
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,880
Because they had a shako
and the red coat,

298
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,520
so he's confused a bunch of watching Welshwomen
for a force of infantry, is what you're saying?

299
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,800
That is the speculation,
that he looked up at the top of the cliffs,

300
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,920
and thought, 'There's a lot of people up there,

301
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,280
'and they look like soldiers.'

302
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,480
One, invent glasses, two, whatever happens
in your life, whatever it is,

303
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,360
you're never going to be the man

304
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,320
who confused a load of Welshwomen
in traditional dress for backup.

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
So what do the French do?

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,280
Run away.

307
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,720
Unconditional surrender, yes,
I'll give you the point.

308
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
The French surrender, the British accept it,

309
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,040
Tate is imprisoned briefly,

310
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,600
and then returns to France
along with most of the force.

311
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,720
There is something about this invasion though,

312
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,880
there is something; 1797, this was.

313
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,080
And there's something special about it,
something that is marked out every time,

314
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,880
on every little…
on every little memorial plaque about this,

315
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
there is something about the invasion
of mainland Britain in 1797.

316
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,880
That will be the last invasion
of mainland Britain.

317
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,440
Mystery Biscuits.

318
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,400
Unlike - going back to the start of this,
so it's not thrown together - 1066,

319
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
which is what everyone else thinks it is.

320
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
Yes, you are absolutely right.

321
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,680
The Battle of Fishguard was the most recent
landing on mainland Britain

322
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
by a hostile foreign force.

323
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
As we record this...

324
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,800
-And on that note...
-Wow.

325
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
congratulations,
Gary, you win the show.

326
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,400
You have won a device to help cool the lower
jaws of South American rodents.

327
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
It's a chinchilla chin chiller.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
So with that we say thank you to Chris Joel.

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
Thank you.

330
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,680
To Gary Brannan,

331
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
