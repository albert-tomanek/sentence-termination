00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,889
China’s #1 Corrupt Official

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,920
Was given the death sentence

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,940
For a lot of bribes

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,769
And a lot of mistresses.

5
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,840
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
Corruption.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,109
It seems the Chinese Communist Party can’t
get enough of it.

9
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,109
What do you expect when your founding principle
is “kill people and take their stuff”?

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,230
But the good thing about corruption is that
since so many officials are corrupt, Chinese

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,050
leader Xi Jinping can use it as a charge to
take down his political enemies.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,820
And his so-called anti-corruption purge has
helped him strengthen his grip on power.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
In China, no one is safe from the purge.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,640
Not even top Party members, like former Security
Chief Zhou Yongkang.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,550
In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison
for graft.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,840
Of course, Zhou had done a lot more than just
steal some money, but that’s what they officially

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
sentenced him for.\h

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,020
And in 2018, the deputy mayor of Luliang,
Zhang Zhongsheng, was convicted of accepting

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,950
bribes worth $166 million dollars.

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,149
And he was sentenced to “immediate death.”

21
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:26,130
Yes, in China, you can get the death penalty
for economic crimes.

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,770
Zhang is still alive though, because his death
sentence is waiting for confirmation from

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,659
the Supreme People’s Court.\h

24
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,829
And more recently, there was Lai Xiaomin.

25
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:44,430
He was board chairman and Party chief of the
state-owned asset management company China

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,430
Huarong.

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,040
In early January, he was also sentenced to
death for corruption.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,179
Over the past ten years, Lai had accumulated
nearly $280 million dollars in bribes.

29
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:02,140
“The scale of the crime is unprecedented.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,960
Not in the 72 years since the founding of
the People’s Republic of China has anyone

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,370
been charged with taking bribes this large.”

32
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,880
Although to be fair, for most of that 72 years,
the Communist Party had kept people way too

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,850
poor to pay bribes that large.

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,860
But it wasn’t just money that was on Lai’s
plate.

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,690
No, no, he really went all in.

36
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,140
Chinese Social Media had coined a nickname
for Lai: “The 3 One Hundreds”.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,280
One hundred Houses, one hundred connections,
and one hundred lovers.\h

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,070
This headline says it all: “He housed 100
lovers in one neighborhood, all of the kids

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,200
called him daddy.”

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,450
You’d think that putting 100 mistresses
in the same area would cause problems, but

41
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,760
I guess when you have 100 mistresses, it’s
all about efficiency.\h

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,120
And it makes sense how this guy got so many
lovers.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,091
Lai’s connections with his company China
Huarong would introduce him to women, and

44
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:17,550
the women would help Lai occupy his many real
estate properties and hide his money.

45
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:24,300
“To avoid getting caught, Lai would accept
bribes in cash, and personally stow them in

46
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,090
a safe in one of his properties.

47
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,450
He would drive in circles to avoid any people
tailing him.

48
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,240
He and his lovers would refer to this house
using the codename ‘Supermarket.’”

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,450
Wow, and I bet his wife thought he was being
so thoughtful by offering to go to the supermarket

50
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,430
all the time.

51
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,580
More on that in a moment.\h

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,630
Because what Lai Xiaomin did was unimaginable.

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,790
Mainly because “He managed to have over
100 women - among them were past wives, current

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,850
wives, and all kinds of mistresses - live
harmoniously with each other, without any

55
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,550
disputes.”

56
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,290
In its own horrible way, that’s actually
pretty impressive.

57
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,340
I mean, how did Lai even keep track of all
these lovers?

58
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,070
Well, apparently Lai would number the women
so it was easy to remember them.

59
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
Perfect!

60
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,000
Now you might wonder, what did Lai Xiaomin’s
wife think about all this?

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Well, wrong question, because it’s actually
wives, plural.

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,219
He had two wives.

63
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:36,069
The second one, he married illegally in Hong
Kong.

64
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,840
One of the things he was sentenced for is
bigamy.

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,560
In 2020, Lai was featured in a documentary
produced by China’s Central Commission for

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,250
Discipline Inspection, where he discusses
his process of accepting bribes, along with

67
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,250
the hardships.

68
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,990
Let’s hear him out.

69
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,259
“I’d drop the money off in one of my houses,
I called it ‘The Supermarket’.

70
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,080
I just put it there.

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,530
It’s all confiscated now.

72
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,039
What was I supposed to do with all that dirty
money?

73
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,940
I was too afraid to spend it.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,740
It was nerve wracking.”

75
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,550
I kind of feel sorry for the poor guy.

76
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,870
He was in too deep!

77
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,639
He couldn’t spend the money, because he
would get caught.

78
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,599
But still people bribed him, and how could
he refuse?

79
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:28,270
I think it’s only fair that they should
let him write a book before they execute him.

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,629
On the day of his arrest, Lai was about to
go swimming with his 23-year-old secretary

81
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,669
when detectives showed up at his office.\h

82
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,050
But he knew this day was coming.

83
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,789
Lai Xiaomin was not your average corrupt official.

84
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,259
I mean, he was the Party secretary and chairman
of one of China’s four big state-owned asset

85
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,410
management firms.\h

86
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,199
Under Xi Jinping’s rule where death penalties
are on the menu, I can almost understand why

87
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,129
all of his hundred lovers didn’t have any
disputes.

88
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,900
They weren’t harmoniously living with each
other, they were cooperating with each other.

89
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,430
Because if word got out, everything would
fall apart.

90
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,819
And now it has.\h

91
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,520
Investigators started looking into his unusually
large number of real estate investments in

92
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,770
April 2018.

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,860
And in November that year, they finally arrested
him after they found 3 metric tons of cash

94
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,439
in his apartment.

95
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,430
And that just goes to show: Crime really does
pay.

96
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,960
Until they execute you.

97
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,599
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you, a fan who supports China

98
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,240
Uncensored through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

99
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,300
Scott Young asks: "In the credits it looks
like you are visiting China.

100
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,439
How did you and Shelly avoid being taken into
custody and sent off to a labor camp?

101
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,580
Thanks."

102
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,159
The trick to not being taken into custody
in China is...to not go to mainland China.

103
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:09,240
The only parts of China I go to now are Taiwan—which
is not controlled by China;\h

104
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,810
Hong Kong—which I can never go back to now
that the National Security Law is in place;\h

105
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,169
and the South China Sea—which was probably
a bad idea at the time and I can’t believe

106
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,400
I made it back alive.

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,099
Thanks for your question, Scott.

108
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,130
And thank you for watching.

Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

112

See you next time.
