00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,859
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,439
what’s happened to Chinese leader Xi Jinping??!!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,010
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,710
Have you seen Xi Jinping?!

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,410
I’ve been looking everywhere for him.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,949
In his favorite chair,

8
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,199
in the boardroom,

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,970
in staged propaganda footage,

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,489
and I can’t find him!

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,700
Wait a minute,

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,840
I think I see him...

13
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:26,759
here.

14
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,459
Oh-no-wait-here.

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,260
No, Xi isn’t tired,

16
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,780
he’s just wearing fatigues.

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,329
And he’s the first Chinese Communist Party
leader to do so.

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,730
Here is shaking hands with members of the
People’s Liberation Army

19
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,980
all of them, whether a green shirt, a blue
shirt,

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,140
or even one of the PLA’s new red shirt brigade.

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,719
For some reason, the numbers in that brigade
seem a little low.

22
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,319
So why the hot new style?

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,600
Well, Xi just gave himself a promotion.

24
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:57,929
According to state-run media,

25
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,129
he’s now the commander-in-chief

26
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,289
of the military's Joint Operations Command
Center.

27
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,309
Why?

28
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,159
According to Party Mouthpiece Xinhua, Xi said,

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,999
“The current situation requires battle command
to be highly strategic, coordinated, timely,

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,240
professional and accurate”

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,149
as well as suave, sophisticated, and exuding
the rich smell of mahogany.

32
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,259
So until Xi Jinping came to power,

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,079
the People’s Liberation Army never had a
joint command.

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,880
Joint command is where the different branches
of the military

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,790
--air force, army, and navy--

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,100
can work together and know what the others
are doing.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,840
Kind of important, right?

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,680
That’s why pretty much every modern military
has one.

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,950
But in China,

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,399
the problem has been that that whoever’s
charge of the joint command

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,789
would also have tremendous political power.

42
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,219
And since your typical Party leader

43
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,110
is pretty much in a constant battle to get
some edge over all the other jerks,

44
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,770
that never happened.

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,340
Well, now Xi’s got an edge over the other
jerks.

46
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,869
Even though when Xi was elected

47
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,229
haha, sorry, that get’s me every time

48
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,519
even though after Xi won the presidential
power struggle,

49
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,610
he also became head of the Central Military
Commission,

50
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,110
this latest move suggests that Xi feels

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,780
he needs to solidify his control over the
military even further.

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,190
Xi has been in a constant battle with other
Party members

53
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,840
tied to former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,970
Xi’s anti-corruption campaign is really
just a way

55
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,909
to purge the most powerful members of Jiang’s
clique.

56
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,890
And the military has been no different.

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,900
China’s Central Military Commission was
once stacked with Jiang Zemin’s people.

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,860
Jiang had appointed a total of 79 generals
in his time.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,150
That’s why, since 2012,

60
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,769
Xi Jinping has been purging and reforming
the military with one clear purpose

61
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,209
to give himself more direct control.

62
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,800
And to ensure that he’s the brains of the
operation,

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,940
top leaders now have to report directly to
him via video link,

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,030
and he’s increased military spending tremendously,

65
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,280
last year reaching 130 billion dollars.

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,909
Plus, Xi has reformed and reorganized the
military,

67
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,870
with new divisions like the PLA Rocket Force,
or PLARF.

68
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,120
PLARF controls China's missile arsenal,

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,549
and is at the same level as PLAGF, PLAAF,
and PLASSF,

70
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,810
which also controls CPLASF.

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,519
Maybe Xi should also reorganize the making-up
military acronyms force,

72
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,090
or MUMAF.

73
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,230
According to China Daily,

74
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,500
Xi’s new position as head of the Joint Operations
Command Center

75
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,040
will “hone their ability for "informationized
warfare."

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,100
“Informationized warfare”?

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,599
Xi may not be a professional soldier,

78
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,930
but he’s clearly a professional...

79
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,590
word creator guy.

80
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,750
But I think this is the real message he wants
to give.

81
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,700
Because clearly, not everyone is loyal enough.

82
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,360
So what will Xi do with his new power?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,540
Leave your cynical comments below.

84
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,100
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
