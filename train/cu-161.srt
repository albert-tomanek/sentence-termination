1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,620
He was harassed by Hong Kong police,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,300
and sent “yakuza flowers”

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,589
as a warning because of his activism.

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,879
Now this hedge fund managers says

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,380
the extradition bill puts Hong Kong's economy
at risk.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,420
Welcome to China Uncensored, I'm Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,410
Today I'm here with Ed Chin, a Hong Kong activist,

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,700
hedge fund manager,

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,560
and founder of 2047 Hong Kong Monitor.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
Thanks for joining me today, Ed.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,250
It's good to see you again Chris.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,860
So tell me a bit about 2047 Hong Kong Monitor.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,370
Sure, after the Umbrella Movement, which ended
in December 2014

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,310
because there's no more occupation,

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,100
there's no more Umbrella Movement,

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,080
the name is changed to 2047 Hong Kong Monitor.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,540
It used to be called the Finance and Banking
Group That Supports Occupy Central.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,059
So we wanted to fight for Hong Kong's democracy

19
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:03,200
until the 50-year nonintervention policy comes
to an end, hopefully.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,059
Which is in 2047.

21
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,729
So you've been fairly outspoken.

22
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,659
Have you faced any backlash?

23
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,709
Yeah, especially in the last six months or
so

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,399
in the so-called US-China trade war.

25
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:21,350
In the very beginning, our core values mean
freedom of speech, freedom of press

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,659
and also the judiciary.

27
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,209
It's under challenge almost any time.

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:31,380
Well pro-democracy legislators have been kicked
out of office.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,340
But you said you faced backlash for this?

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,939
Because they visited my office, where we are
filming now, inside my boardroom...

31
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,409
You say “they” visited you, what do you
mean?

32
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,509
This is someone...

33
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,560
Usually when you see a police visit your office,

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,450
they have to have a warrant of sorts, right?

35
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,200
And they could make up an excuse saying,

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,359
This is interesting, January 1st, it's a public
holiday, statutory holiday.

37
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,200
The police claimed that someone received a
phonecall

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,190
saying someone comes into my office January
1st

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,230
for an interview, a job interview.

40
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,960
And after two hours, then come out.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,350
So that makes me kind of suspicious.

42
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,860
Who would make such a claim and then they
just come in with an excuse.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,950
Just to intimidate you for no reason.

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,040
I never mentioned that publicly, so this is
the first time.

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,960
And it's not just one time.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,560
It's many times within a month.

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
How many times?

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,290
Usually eight times.

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,290
So Hong Kong police visited you eight times?

50
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,710
Not just here, but also residential.

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,110
That means sending an ambulance, sending a
fire truck.

52
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,770
So that makes me wonder, am I very popular?

53
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,840
No.

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,800
But I wonder does it have anything to do with
the sings that we raise up so

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,150
we did raise the concern to the right party,
so to speak.

56
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,780
I don't want to be too vivid about who we
visited.

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,180
But after about five to six minutes of investigation,

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,570
the police came back with a letter saying
nothing could be found.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,150
That's on record.

60
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,760
Nothing that could be found at your place
when they came to visit?

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,140
They cannot find the person who made these
prank calls.

62
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,180
But this is something that makes your neighbors

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,670
and even people around you think,

64
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,930
hey, what's going on, right?

65
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, if ambulances and firetrucks are showing
up outside,

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
what was it, your place of residence?

67
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,360
Yeah, that, too.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
And residence,

69
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,440
and I'm not trying to have a barbecue inside
a condominium, like a huge one.

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,170
But at 3:30am when you see this different
things...

71
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,569
It was the middle of the night!

72
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,010
The middle of the night.

73
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,010
Wow.

74
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,510
And I understand you got a nice bouquet of
flowers one time?

75
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,430
Yeah, that's the one time it made me really
get concerned

76
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,960
because you think about the nerve gas, or
as they call it, nerve agent

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,470
that I think, two years ago, there was a father
and a daughter

78
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,889
who were Russian spies who lived in the UK.

79
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,919
They sniff into that and it cause permanent
brain damage.

80
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,800
So of course when I receive roses,

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,099
you know, it is like the Yakuza, you know
from Japan,

82
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,710
that's like a death ultimatum.

83
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,580
Kind of telling you not to say things they
don't like.

84
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,039
Anyways, I think to say this publicly, I'm
just saying that

85
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,660
I want to defend Hong Kong's values.

86
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,020
That's why I say this:

87
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,870
Hong Kong shouldn't be like any other place
that is inside China.

88
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,909
Hong Kong is still Hong Kong, right?

89
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:03,500
So I want to say that I want to protect the
core values.

90
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,330
That's why I'm outspoken today.

91
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,050
Well that seems perfectly reasonable.

92
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,240
Whoever sent you the bouquet of roses,

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,460
maybe they were just trying to thank you.

94
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,759
Oh, thank you for being outspoken.

95
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,340
I hope so!

96
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,009
It's better than some Yakuza sending you nerve
gas-tainted flowers.

97
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,099
But that was in January

98
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:31,949
and now we're sitting in very uncertain times
in Hong Kong now

99
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,849
because of this extradition treaty.

100
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,680
A lot of people went to the street just a
few days ago.

101
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,940
Nd it turned into a bugger thing

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,210
we haven't seen five years after the Umbrella
Movement.

103
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,680
Speaking of the extradition bill, you've been
very outspoken about it.

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,050
And this bill would allow the Hong Kong government
to send people

105
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,719
in Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.

106
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,979
How would the extradition bill affect the
economy of Hong Kong?

107
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:09,930
It is showing a lot of side effects now, and
actually,

108
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,089
Last few months, since April, things got escalated
after

109
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,039
many, two or three rallies now.

110
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,509
The first rally I think was in March.

111
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,740
We only got 13,000 people to show up.

112
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,889
At the end of April, April 28th, we got 130,000.

113
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,919
And the last one that we had, just less than
ten days ago,

114
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,219
we had over 1.03 million.

115
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:41,469
Over one million people came out.

116
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,960
That's unprecedented.

117
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,969
In a city that has 7 million people.

118
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,629
Yes, 1/7 of the population came out

119
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,949
just to say no to legalized kidnapping of
Hong Kongers

120
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,509
and foreigners who live in Hong Kong,

121
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,479
anyone passing by, to China.

122
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,529
So as a hedge fund manager,

123
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:03,069
what do you think this is going to do for
the economy of Hong Kong?

124
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:10,089
Now because after the 1.03 million rally,

125
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,189
three days afterward there was also police
brutality

126
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:17,770
near the central, near the LegCo building.

127
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,139
And the police also, these are like riot police.

128
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,129
They beat up everyone and fire more than 150
tear gas canisters

129
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,960
with rubber bullets and also bean bag bullets,

130
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,139
and using batons to bash everyone.

131
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,749
And then facing the head, not the limbs, the
head.

132
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:44,099
So some law-only managers were saying if things
get worse, they will pull out.

133
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,689
And then one hedge-fund manager told me

134
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,659
he would dump all Hong Kong stocks if one
person dies from this event.

135
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,809
So the wealthy are looking to move their money
outside of Hong Kong.

136
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,809
That, too.

137
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,220
That's related to offshore banking.

138
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,030
There's a lot of inquiry,

139
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,909
that if you check the offshore banking units,

140
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,490
more than 30% new inquiries.

141
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,509
So every hour, the offshore banking unit of
any global bank

142
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,669
would have a lot of businesses.

143
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,629
Which means they do not trust the Hong Kong
jurisdiction.

144
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,960
If things get worse, if they park their money
overseas,

145
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,020
let's say in an overseas offshore jurisdiction,

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:34,300
all they have to do is wire the money to the
offshore banking site, that bank.

147
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,340
So I was telling people that in the worst
case scenario,

148
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,290
you should have at least 60% of your liquid
cash in the offshore banking site

149
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,510
of that bank that you use.

150
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,940
So you've seen, as sort of the rule of law
has been changing,

151
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,730
as the rule of law has been eroding in Hong
Kong,

152
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,020
wealthy people can't trust that their fortunes
inside of Hong Kong are safe.

153
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,320
Just two hours ago I was reading the Apple
Daily,

154
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,900
which is the highest circulation paper in
Hong Kong

155
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,700
and also pro-democracy newspaper that's under
attack.

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,060
They had a feature saying one wealthy person,

157
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,040
this is not like your affluent.

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,840
So it's like a tycoon in Hong Kong.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:38,780
Move 100 million U.S., a lot of money, to
Singapore.

160
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,440
So it's like a global bank.

161
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,130
US-based global bank with Singapore as a regional
headquarters.

162
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,110
So it's like transferring money from Hong
Kong jurisdiction to Singapore.

163
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,670
That means something.

164
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,050
So the reaction from the wealthy,

165
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,130
is this different than in 2014 with the Umbrella
Movement?

166
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,170
2014, it was fighting for one person one vote
without pre-screening.

167
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,100
With this one you see even the pro-Beijing
business people come out

168
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,640
because they are also afraid that they don't
know whether they would...

169
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,590
When they do travel, they don't know whether
they'd pay a certain bribe,

170
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,010
let's say to open a factory.

171
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,380
There's many different levels of government.

172
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,180
You have to use not just guanxi, but also
use money to get certain licenses,

173
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,080
to get electricity, hydro, whatever, right?

174
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,350
So they were afraid that by doing these,

175
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:46,800
they would fall into the trap of reaching
this proposed extradition treaty or bill.

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,260
That they would fall into this landmine themselves.

177
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,470
So they were not too happy about it.

178
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,540
These are the normal pro-Beijing guys.

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,110
So universal suffrage,

180
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,980
that doesn't matter to a lot of these people.

181
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,990
But when it starts to threaten their fortunes,

182
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,800
that's what got people out onto the streets.

183
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,550
Yes because China could say you break certain
rules

184
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,320
and then ask the Hong Kong court

185
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,720
and then ask the commercial crime unit of
the Hong Kong police

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,420
to freeze your Hong Kong bank account.

187
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,800
Make it under investigation for a period of
time.

188
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Then you can't do anything.

189
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
Then you are stuck.

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,670
Which is why you want to get your money out
of Hong Kong.

191
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,110
Yes, and also you could be tried inside China
court,

192
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,600
and be like another Causeway Bay bookseller,
who go missing.

193
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,220
So people are concerned.

194
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,870
So it's not just the normal activist in Hong
Kong.

195
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,400
Which our activists like Joshua Wong,

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,010
and also professor Benny Tai is serving jail
time right now

197
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,280
in Hong Kong as we are filming this.

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,450
Carrie Lam just announced that she's going
to postpone the extradition bill.

199
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,470
Do you think that's going to take away people's
fears?

200
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,610
I think yes, to a certain extent, but also
no

201
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,910
because this means putting it to a pause.

202
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,230
What does a pause mean?

203
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,310
If you play your computer,

204
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,500
pause, you can play this evil thing again.

205
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:31,680
So I think a lot of Hong Kongers, after this
extradition proposal

206
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,320
was put forward from a few months ago,

207
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,050
we lost trust in the government.

208
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:44,820
A lot of people, they might think that after
the Umbrella Movement,

209
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,190
people don't care anymore because no matter
what you do,

210
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,370
they will still find a chief executive that
Beijing likes,

211
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,130
and then that's it, right?

212
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,100
Nothing you can do much about.

213
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,240
But this is about their lives, their well-being,

214
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,870
their security, both financial and also personal.

215
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,660
So everyone is fighting very hard about it.

216
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,530
But I think a lot of people, after the so-called
“horror movie,”

217
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,980
the horror show,

218
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,790
a lot of people have decided to leave Hong
Kong this summer.

219
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,340
If they have kids,

220
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,400
why not go back to places they immigrated
from before?

221
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,440
A lot of people relocated after 1997, too,
to be honest.

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,560
Over 300,000 Canadians come back,

223
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,930
and they see things are okay.

224
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,980
Things were okay for the first ten years,
I would say.

225
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,240
But things are not okay now.

226
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,150
When you have a president with an unlimited
term,

227
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,150
that concerns people, too.

228
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,420
And Carrie Lam being looked at as a puppet,

229
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,840
but she has been quite ruthless in the way
she handles Hong Kong people.

230
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,519
Not just the kids, but across all segments
of the society.

231
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,750
We have been very discontent about what she
did.

232
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,060
Yes I've been hearing in Hong Kong people,
in Cantonese,

233
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,790
calling the extradition bill an evil law.

234
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,700
Yes, yes, it is evil because it is a horror
show, put it this way.

235
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,780
People can't sleep in.

236
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,620
And there's also, put it in finance terms,

237
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,600
we call it an option the Hong Kong government
put out.

238
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,850
It's a “put” option, as in putting you
down

239
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,370
with a short-term expiry date.

240
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,800
Time value is depleting very fast.

241
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,580
We thought it would be end of June

242
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,680
before Donald Trump and president Xi

243
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,400
meet for the G20.

244
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,640
So they're setting up a very evil platform
to scare everyone

245
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
including Americans like yourself.

246
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,260
It's good that we do this in Hong Kong, but
next time, who knows, right?

247
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,560
Yeah, I'm happy I got in.

248
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
Yeah, if the extradition bill is passed,

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,590
then a lot of people might not want to come.

250
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,430
So I understand that, in response to the extradition
bill,

251
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,900
the U.S. Has considered changing some of its
policies toward Hong Kong.

252
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,530
How do you think that would affect the economy
of Hong Kong?

253
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,370
If the so-called Hong Kong Policy Act,

254
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,730
if the U.S. kills it,

255
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,690
I still think it's not likely yet

256
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,120
unless the Hong Kong government does something
very stupid,

257
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,540
which is close to the edge of doing something
stupid.

258
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:43,210
Because an exco member, meaning the executive
board so-to-speak of Hong Kong,

259
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,010
one guy's name is Bernard Chen.

260
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:56,770
He was hinting that he did not want to see
people to use, well,

261
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,410
he didn't use the word “military action.”

262
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,480
But enforcement, he didn't want to see any
enforcement people

263
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,690
other than the Hong Kong police

264
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,160
to clean up the mess, so to speak.

265
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,050
Sort of implying China's People's Liberation
Army.

266
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,050
Which is just a one-minute walk away from
Carrie Lam's office.

267
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,020
That's true, the garrison is very close to
the chief executive's office.

268
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,960
Her office is just next to LegCo.

269
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,370
You cross the street and it's the PLA barrack.

270
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,400
That was some very interesting city planning.

271
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,480
Yes, it's very interesting.

272
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,660
So it's scaring quite a few people.

273
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,060
Do you think the extradition bill is the end
of Hong Kong's autonomy?

274
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,040
If the extradition bill is passed, and I mentioned
it quite publicly, too,

275
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,050
that means putting the One Country Two Systems
experiment,

276
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,320
not to a halt, but it's finished.

277
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,610
It's finished.

278
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,540
But think about it:

279
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,740
It was Deng Xiaoping,

280
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,459
the former former paramount leader after Tiananmen.

281
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,370
That was a big mistake.

282
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,350
And then because of this, you think about
this very good idea,

283
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:18,180
using economic reform to make people take
a second look at China.

284
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,740
And now of course Hong Kong people do benefit

285
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,140
from the so-called economic miracle

286
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,850
that we benefit in the last 30 or so years.

287
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,140
Like even before 1997.

288
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,740
The joint declaration was signed in 1984.

289
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,980
And of course, afterwards, there was Tiananmen.

290
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,040
And Deng Xiaoping gave us reassurance that
things would be okay.

291
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,180
Some people took a leap of faith and came
back to Hong Kong,

292
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
I being one.

293
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,340
I came back in the year 2000.

294
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,010
This is almost 20 years for myself being in
Asia and also Hong Kong.

295
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,030
So if somebody watching wanted to learn more
about you

296
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,809
or some of the causes you're standing up for,

297
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:01,809
where should they go?

298
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:02,809
What should they do?

299
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,309
I know you are also a book writer.

300
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,050
Occasionally I write one book every year.

301
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,930
Usually the first three chapters on finance.

302
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,440
The next two chapters is more on activism
and democracy stuff.

303
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,690
And then I'll put your picture in the book,
too.

304
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,860
That'd be great!

305
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,100
Usually we have the Hong Kong book fair in
the mid of July.

307
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,180
So if the evil bill is not passed, definitely
to book can be printed,

308
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,780
and they can see the new book – the trilogy.

309
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,880
This will be part three of this.

310
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,650
How to edge your risks in uncertain times:
part three.

311
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,280
Be careful, you're becoming a Hong Kong bookseller.

312
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,710
Yeah, wow, thanks for reminding me.

313
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,860
But for people watching,

314
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,650
is there a website or a Twitter handle?

315
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,230
Where can they learn more about you?

316
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,690
They can look into my personal public Facebook
page, Edward Ching,

317
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,210
it's very easy to find.

318
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,100
Our activist group is 2047 HK Monitor.

319
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,770
You'll see a lot of things in English

320
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,130
and also traditional Chinese.

321
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,300
Great.

322
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,080
Well thank you for joining me today, Ed.

323
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
It's been a pleasure.

324
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,440
Thank you Chris, and I will see you in Hong
Kong soon, I hope.

325
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,740
I hope I'll be in Hong Kong soon, yeah.

326
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,280
Thank you.

327
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
Thank you.
