1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,490
Xi Jinping Thought gets added

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,550
to another constitution—

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,490
just when Chris Chappell Thought...

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,610
that he’d had enough.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,740
Is a trade war between

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,059
the US and China brewing?

8
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,950
I hope it’s over tea.

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,440
And finally, Ice Boy is back in the news.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,540
Just let it go.

11
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,600
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,900
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,200
Well I know it’s the moment you’ve all
been waiting for.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,890
Yes, at the end of last week—finally—

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,449
we were treated to the second plenary session

17
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,839
of the 19th Party Central Committee.

18
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:43,940
It’s that special time of the year when
top officials

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,600
have another important meeting to discuss

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,640
the things they already decided on.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,749
Like whether to add Xi Jinping Thought

22
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,109
to the Constitution of China.

23
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,109
The answer was...

24
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,710
yes!

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,850
Now wait, you say.

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,000
Wasn’t “Xi Jinping thought on Socialism

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,469
with Chinese characteristics for a new era”

28
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,700
already added to China’s constitution?

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,920
No, silly.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,240
You’re thinking of 19th Party Congress

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,480
back in November!

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,500
That’s when “Xi Jinping thought”

33
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,049
was written into the Communist Party’s constitution.

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,100
This time,

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,000
they agreed to write Xi Jinping Thought

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,720
into the country’s constitution.

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,460
Yes, those are two different things.

38
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,670
The point is, Xi Jinping is ungodly powerful.

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,710
I say that because remember,

40
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,579
the Communist Party is officially atheist.

41
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,880
He can’t very well be godly powerful,

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,119
otherwise people wouldn’t be allowed

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,939
to believe in him.

44
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,260
But adding Xi Jinping Thought to China’s
constitution

45
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,590
wasn’t the only change.

46
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,200
They also added a line about the need

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
to have a nationwide surveillance system.

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,259
I just hope that doesn’t conflict with Article
40,

49
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,229
which says freedom and privacy are protected
by law.

50
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,630
So this Chinese New Year,

51
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,979
make a resolution to get in shape!

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,189
If you’re going to be watched,

53
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,580
you might as well look good.

54
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,190
The relationship between the US

55
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,400
and the Chinese regime

56
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,530
has been strained this week.

57
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,200
US trade authorities suggested

58
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,190
they may take concrete steps

59
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,850
to protect US intellectual property.

60
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,610
It comes right after the US imposed tariffs

61
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,980
on foreign solar panels,

62
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,290
a market China dominates.

63
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,050
“Trump’s move helps US solar-panel manufacturers,

64
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,580
such as FirstSolar, Tesla, Suniva, and SolarWorld.”

65
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,820
But according to Quartz,

66
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,670
the results may be mixed.

67
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,780
Suniva, for one,

68
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,560
is majority owned by a Chinese company.

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Alongside the solar panel tariff

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,190
was one made on foreign washing machines.

71
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,380
But, will that help the US get to the bottom

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,310
of wherever that one missing sock disappears
to?

73
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,060
Let’s hope so because I’m running out.

74
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,500
The US has imposed more sanctions on North
Korea.

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,800
I frankly didn’t know there was anything
left to sanction.

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,290
They target “North Korea’s crude oil industry

77
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,370
and shipping companies as well as

78
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,930
individuals or entities in Russia and China.”

79
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,630
The Trump administration has long hoped

80
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,130
for the Chinese regime’s help in reining
in North Korea,

81
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,210
but China has been perhaps less than proactive.

82
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,990
Like the whole secretly selling oil thing.

83
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,510
Freedom House has released its 2018

84
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,470
Freedom in the World Report.

85
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,930
China earned a score of 14 out of 100,

86
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,480
one point less than last year.

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,710
If only it was a game of golf,

88
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,840
then China would be doing so well!

89
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,490
Except golf is frowned upon in China

90
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,570
for being too bougie.

91
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,200
And Chinese censors are cracking down

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,150
on China’s fledgling hip hop community.

93
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,530
According to the BBC,

94
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,740
at the second plenary session last week,

95
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,380
“A memo surface that said programmes could

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,340
no longer feature any hip-hop content or artists.”

97
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,180
State-run media have in particular targeted
PG One,

98
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,300
the winner of a Chinese reality show called
the Rap of China.

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,660
Some of his lyrics are demeaning towards women,

100
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
and others hint at drug use.

101
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,320
Too bad PG One didn’t keep it PG-13.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,480
But instead of standing by his lyrics,

103
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,790
he apologized,

104
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,000
removed some of his songs from the internet,

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,199
and blamed them on the bad influence of “black
music.”

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,860
And remember “ice boy” from a few weeks
ago?

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,300
He was a symbol of rural poverty.

108
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,800
But now he’s become a great photo op

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
for the Chinese Communist Party.

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,650
Ice boy endured the hardship

111
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,770
of walking 3 miles to school every day

112
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,009
in the freezing weather

113
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,599
with only a thin coat.

114
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,169
Surely all of China can be so resilient.

115
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,539
He was invited, “to the capital over the
weekend

116
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:48,580
and celebrated as a patriotic hero.

117
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,150
He waved a Chinese flag in Tiananmen Square,

118
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,800
tried on riot gear at a public security bureau

119
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,830
and swore an oath to be loyal to China

120
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,710
and the ruling Communist Party.”

121
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,919
Of course he did.

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,289
And he said he wants to become a police officer.

123
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,020
Aww, isn’t he cute!

124
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,539
I bet no one told him about

125
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,620
the part of that job

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,919
that involves arresting dissidents.

127
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,351
What’s most interesting about Ice Boy

128
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,759
become a celebrity in Beijing,

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,620
is that the Communist Party has managed

130
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,229
to use him to bury the narrative about

131
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,169
how Ice Boy represents the crippling rural
poverty

132
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,789
that affects nearly half of China’s population.

133
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:30,789
Poverty?

134
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,879
No, Ice Boy is struggling against

135
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,530
the icy conditions of winter!

136
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,229
Just like the Communist Party struggles

137
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,939
on behalf of the people.

138
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,210
And coming up after the break,

139
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,229
we’ll take a look at how the Communist Party

140
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,780
helps get guns into the hands of ISIS.

141
