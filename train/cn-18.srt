In front of me I have an article from

Can we just...

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,780
Good siren noise there.

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,480
Can we just take a minute to acknowledge 
how good that siren noise was?!

In front of me I've got an article from

And today we are talking about Thomas Midgley Jr.

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,240
Son of Thomas Midgley?

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,280
I mean one would assume so, yeah.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
It doesn't explicitly say that here.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,520
It'll be under early life. I'm pretty sure.

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,440
It's not! It just said where he was born.
Which was the town of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.

31
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,820
Also known as a 'Slut Drop'.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,640
I said that before I thought about it!

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,620
- That's a better joke than I was thinking about.
- Pennsylvania, you're it this week!

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,320
Either that, or it's a town at the bottom of a cliff.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,580
Above it is a large woodland. 
With a very heavily disguised edge of cliff.

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,020
"What are we going to call this place?"

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,800
That's my impression of a beaver, by the way.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
I don't know what noise they make 
when they hit the ground, I've never seen it.

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,480
A siren noise by the sound of it.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,960
Oh, it's a trumpet.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,540
Yeah.

42
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,180
Yeah. Grew up in Ohio, then. And went to Cornell University with a degree in mechanical engineering.

43
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,880
He sounds like an awful person(!)

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,380
His father was an inventor and he was an inventor
and he made, I think a... great change to the world.

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,500
Although it might not have been for the better.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,020
The automatic French horn?

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,280
Why would you need an
automatic French horn, Gary?

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,420
To save you having the trouble of
playing a French horn, dickhead!

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,860
You've got player pianos, why not player French horns?

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,680
-Yeah!
-OK! Yeah!

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,080
Come on. It's the general trend towards
playerisation of the entire orchestra.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,180
They just stumbled on the kettle drum.

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,620
It's a self-boiling kettle drum.

54
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,660
It's just a kettle with the drum attached to it and steam...

55
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,540
"That's not quite what we had in mind. 
But useful in the morning!"

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,860
Eight am.

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
"But I do have hot water for tea now, so that's good."

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,480
And everybody's awake!

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,100
No.

60
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,100
That's not what he invented.

61
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,820
I'm out.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,720
Tom, are you asking us of all the things that could 
have been invented in the 1900s

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,600
I was hoping that you might hit on something
I could move towards it. But no...

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,260
Ivory harvesting machine?

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,840
...since you went with automatic French horn and ivory harvesting machine, no! Nothing like that.

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,340
Let me see if I can narrow this down a bit. He was working at Dayton Research Laboratories.

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,460
Oh! Dayton Research Laboratories!

68
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,380
Still no idea.

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,820
...which are a subdivision of General Motors.

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,940
So what would he be working on, 
in about 1920? This is December 1921.

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,100
Nuclear powered car?

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,380
The double decker bus?

73
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,180
No, no, but you are technically closer. It's something to do with how cars are powered.

74
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,900
Nuclear powered double decker bus!

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,920
I mean...

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,140
That's a great film actually.

77
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,900
That's combining both noes there.

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,240
Wait. What film is that? I remember that.

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,180
- The Big Bus.
- The Big Bus!

80
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,240
Big Bus, brilliant.

81
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,260
All I remember is someone pulling a lever and the flags of all nations popping out of the top of it.

82
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,100
Yep. Yeah.

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Wow!

84
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,260
It actually predates Airplane! as well.

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,820
- It was a comedy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,500
Aaw!

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,160
Well "comedy".

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,120
If you want a serious one, did
you hear about Supertrain?

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,260
No?

90
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,440
This was a massive flop for NBC, in the US.

91
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,900
It was one of the worst, one of the most expensive
and greatest television failures of all time.

92
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,060
This sounds like it should be in 
my DVD collection already.

93
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,660
You know how they had the Love Boat?

94
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,360
I do know how they had the Love Boat.

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,660
Would you explain the Love Boat for our viewers?

96
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,260
The Love Boat was a serial. I think it was probably weekly or something. Where you have a cruise liner.

97
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,480
A boat went around, trying to shag other boats.

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,360
My God! The one with the oil tanker! 
You should have seen that one.

99
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,780
Lubricated.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,200
That's kinda what it sounded like.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,460
Make sure this one is called the 
'Gary Brannan Sound Effects Special'

102
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,440
As I have just done a cruise liner shagging an oil tanker.

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,160
Erm, no. I don't think it was a comedy. It was a kind of a light drama maybe. Romantic drama.

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
Where you had a cruise liner...

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,440
So was this like Tugs?

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
No, no, no, no.

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,900
Wow! I bloody love Tugs.
Tugs, by the way, to digest...

111
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,760
- Digest?!
- Tugs was like Thomas the Tank Engine on water.

112
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,820
We are now three diversions deep.
But keep going.

- We'll circle back round.
- Tinder username!

114
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,580
This is, I think, the third season in a row...

115
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,240
where you have referenced Tinder, despite 
being the one married person at the table.

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,580
Yeah! The one who's safest to reference
it without any eyes swivelling on it.

117
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,300
That's fair.

118
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,840
But the Love Boat is a giant cruise liner...

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,080
and you have guest stars every week and romantic things would happen, while at sea.

120
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,700
- Right.
- But because you're in international waters...

121
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,660
there's all manners of deviancy you could get up to.

122
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,280
This was the point. You could have a 
steady, regular cast for the crew...

123
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,300
and guest stars each week, 
for the passengers on the ferry.

124
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,440
Superdeathtrain!

125
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,960
Supertrain.

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,340
Which was NBC going,

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,280
"Huh. They've got that, what can we do differently so it's not a complete ripoff? Let's put it on a train."

128
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
Wow!

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,400
"Let's put it on a nuclear powered train, that goes from New York to Los Angeles, in 36 hours."

130
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,440
"That's a great idea. That can't possibly fail."

131
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,500
Yes, when you do the math, that means 
the train is doing about 80 miles an hour.

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,580
That's hardly impressive.

133
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,240
That's hardly impressive at all. No.

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,260
In fact you can do that on the West Coast Main Line.

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,920
You actually could.

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,940
Double width train, so you can get
some sets and things like that.

137
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,080
- Of course.
- Stupid, stupid idea from start to finish.

138
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,880
But it was like, "this is the big series. This is what we're going to do."

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
Sounds expensive.

140
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,900
Yes, it was massively expensive... it did not work.

141
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,060
Why did we talk about Supertrain?

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,580
- I don't know. We talked about nuclear powered...
- Big Bus.

143
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,620
- Nuclear powered bus. The Big Bus.
- Big bus.

144
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,760
Yep.

145
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,840
- And then where were we...
- And I said nuclear powered cars.

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,360
- Because it was an invention for the motor.
- Because he was working in Dayton...

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
Because Thomas Midgley Jr...

148
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,400
invented something about how cars were powered.

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,220
God, I watched Inception last night. 
And this is more difficult.

150
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,220
That's not surprising, I've seen Inception.

151
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,080
What was the invention in the 1920s?

152
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,600
That would reduce the...

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
- That would make engines more effective.
- Was it an electric car?

154
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,280
No it wasn't.

155
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,680
No, it was definitely petrol. In fact this
was something to do with the petrol.

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
Leaded petrol?

157
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,340
Point! [DING]

158
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,060
Absolutely spot on.

159
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,720
Nice. Nice, harmonisation there.

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,940
Yeah, that was good.

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,200
He added tetraethyl lead...

162
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,260
The scamp!

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,580
...to petrol and discovered it reduced 'knocking'.

164
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,700
On heaven's door?

165
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,220
Yes! Yes that's why...

166
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,100
"Do you need to cure Bob Dylan?
Use lead!"

167
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,620
(That worked for JFK.)

168
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,420
"What did he die of?"
"Lead poisoning."

169
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,020
Do you know, when it got to unleaded cars,
in the early 90s, when it started coming in?

170
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,700
They stopped selling four star. 
Four star petrol used to be leaded petrol.

171
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,780
-And two star.
-And two star, they stopped selling it.

172
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,980
A relative of mine, who shall remain nameless,
he's an older gentleman, shall we say

173
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,660
Decided he wanted to convert his car to use unleaded petrol. It was quite an expensive procedure.

174
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,860
So what he did was, he got unleaded petrol. Put it in the tank, and then bought, through a magazine

175
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,940
today it would have been off a dodgy web site, 
but in those days it was a magazine

176
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,340
some 'thing' you could put in your tank,
to make your car unleaded.

177
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,240
When they came, it was effectively lead shot.

178
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,920
So he put unleaded petrol in... lead shot in,
which re-adds lead. Let's face it.

179
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
And he was convinced that his car was running on unleaded petrol, with all the benefits thereof.

180
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,120
Genius!

181
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,320
So this was the problem. Lead in petrol does
reduce 'knocking'. What's the problem there?

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,380
- It adds lead.
- It adds lead!

183
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,360
Yes, absolutely. Have a point [DING]

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
It adds extremely toxic lead.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,740
Which then gets sprayed out,
in the exhaust, over everyone nearby.

186
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,480
Which is why we went to unleaded petrol. 
Which is why we had all that.

187
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,880
Because lead is bad!

188
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,820
If you didn't know that.

189
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,740
What happened in 1923, just two years later,
with Midgley? What did he do?

190
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,160
[CHORUS] Die of lead poisoning!

191
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,720
I mean not quite, I'm not actually giving 
anyone a point there, because, between the...

192
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,360
no one was a third of a
point close enough, to get that word.

193
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,500
But he did take a prolonged vacation, 
to cure himself of lead poisoning.

194
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,440
What did they call the addition?

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,160
Lead.

196
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,440
No!

197
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,760
No. They knew that would not work well for marketing, so with tetra, ethyl and lead, They picked?

198
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
-Plumbum.
-Plumbum!

199
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,640
Pumbum, ooh! Latin joke!

200
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,740
'Tis indeed.

201
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,560
Yeah, but you can't say 'Putting bum in your petrol tank'!

202
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,540
No, they went with ethyl

203
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,580
Plumbum petrol.

204
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,760
"Plumbum petrol, good for you and your car!"

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,980
So they had a prototype plant...

206
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,380
They started making the stuff...

207
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,740
You don't make lead form plants.

208
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,500
Isn't a prototype plant a seed?

209
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,060
They had a prototype factory.
Where they were making the stuff.

210
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,780
What happened to the people who worked there?

211
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,340
[CHORUS] They all got lead poisoning!

212
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,060
Point. [DING] Yes.

213
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,860
So this is clearly quite dangerous stuff.

214
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,760
Midgley called a press conference,
to demonstrate its safety.

215
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,140
What did he do to demonstrate?

216
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,320
Sprayed it onto some kids!

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
He ate a sandwich made of lead.

218
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,420
Killed the journalist, through lead poisoning.

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,840
He produced a song and dance number 'Lead! It's Great!'

220
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
He had a lead lolly.

221
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,960
Lead lolly, yellow lolly!

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,700
He turned up on a set, 
made entirely of lead, and produced a sitcom.

223
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,520
-You're all...
-Right?

224
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,560
-Dancing around...
-Did he writhe around in lead shot?

225
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,140
-You know like...
-What a great age Victoriana was!

226
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,720
You know like mud wrestling, but lead wrestling.

227
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,420
You know what Matt? You're bloody 
close enough. No one else is going to get it

228
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,520
[DING] He wrestled in lead?

229
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,100
No, he poured the stuff all over his hands...

230
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah?

231
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,400
and then just put the bottle under his nose,
for sixty seconds, just sniffed it... for a while.

232
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,440
And then died of lead poisoning.

233
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,680
He claimed...

234
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,480
He's already got the first signs of lead poisoning,
of madness, already. Let's face it.

235
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,700
Well he claimed, that...

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,720
Hang on! Lead? He poured lead

237
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,260
Not liquid?

238
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,700
Poured... the stuff with lead in it

239
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
The stuff they were putting in the petrol

240
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,120
Molten lead over his hands.

241
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,340
Argh!

242
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,080
"This is fine, really!"

243
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,660
He said he could do this every day, without succumbing to any problems whatsoever. What then happened?

244
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,360
He died?

245
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
-He succumbed to lead poisoning? 
-Lead poisoning?

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,740
No, he managed to survive.

247
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,660
His hands fell off?

248
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,200
There and then.

249
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,420
"Well this is embarrassing!"

250
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,160
I'll give Chris the point [DING]. 
He retired, because of lead poisoning.

251
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,540
'Cause of lead.

252
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,640
Did I even say that?

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
I mean I'll take it.

254
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,540
To be honest, I kinda kept track, 
all amidst the ridiculous suggestions

255
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,880
of what you could do with lead at a press conference .

256
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,680
-I kind of...
-Are you saying you couldn't writhe around in lead?

257
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,900
At a press conference?

258
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,080
-I mean that...
-Call a press conference!

259
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,880
You'd get quite severe burns.

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
He's in a lead suit

261
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,520
-It's rather...
-"Hello? Bring me the lead..."

262
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,920
"Also, tell me what accent this is."

263
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
"I don't know..."

264
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,880
"And why I'm speaking in to my hand?"

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,160
"Sir! That is lead."

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,980
"Fantastic!"

267
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,840
So needless to say, he didn't have 
a great effect on the environment.

268
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,620
Well, I mean he had a great 
effect on the environment. It wasn't a...

269
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,920
-Good one.
-A 'great'... effect...

270
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,020
on the environment.

271
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,420
So he moved on to somewhere else, in General Motors.

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes?

273
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,380
He moved out of that division. Obviously lead went
on to be quite successful... as a thing, in petrol.

274
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,900
Did he move on to drinkable arsenic? 
Or something like that?

275
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,300
Well, you say that!

276
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
He did.

277
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,540
Did he put lead in the windows? Or lead in the...

278
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,900
Leaded windows on cars. All little hexagons

279
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,200
Stained glass cars.

280
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,120
Beautiful image of St. Christopher
on the rear window. It really, really is.

281
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,740
Admit it...

282
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,120
It needs thousands of pounds now 
to replace it now. It really does.

283
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,820
Admit it. You want it though don't you?

284
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
Of course I ****ing want it.

285
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,540
Why doesn't the Popemobile have that?

286
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,820
Very difficult to make that bullet proof, I imagine.

287
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,400
Oh, that's fair. That's fair.

288
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,380
Stained polycarbonate, doesn't 
really have the same ring about it.

289
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,360
You just need the lead then.

290
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,640
Forget the window.

291
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,180
It's an actual leaded window.

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
It's lead lined lead.

293
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,640
You might be being a bit
generous with window there, Matt.

294
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,260
It's safe from...

295
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,580
Just a shield.

296
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,700
It's safe from Superman though.

297
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,020
Superman can no longer see the Pope. That's fine.

298
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,480
Oh yeah, 'cause that's how Superman gets his kicks.

299
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,880
We technically have two popes, which is quire rare.

300
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
-I don't have any popes.
-Well...

301
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,940
I mean you guys have been in my house.
If you can find one pope!

302
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,040
You've got a pope infestation.

303
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,200
"Oh, I'll tell you what mate, it'll take a while to get..."

304
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
I've tried spraying in Anglicanism. It's not shifting 'em.

305
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,180
The weirdest thing is, they don't breed. But you know.

306
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,800
The thing is, you could bring in your Anglicanism, 
but you just end up with an infestation

307
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,640
of bishops and archbishops, which are even
harder to get rid of, because they...

308
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,700
Because they can only move diagonally!

309
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,140
Thomas Midgley Junior, meanwhile

310
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,240
Meanwhile, back at the Popemobile.

311
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,220
Having retired from that...

312
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,020
This is a day of sound effects for you.

313
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,100
Having...

314
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,300
Can we have a goose please?

315
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,400
Go back to the old standards.

316
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,620
And let's go for train.

317
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,520
And both together.

318
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,020
Thank you.

319
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,980
That was a good one. A good combo one.

320
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,480
That's one of the better ones in recent years.

321
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,300
Old school! Old school.

322
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,380
He moved on from the cars divisions of 
General Motors and he moved to Frigidaire.

323
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,540
Oh for ****s sake he put loads 
of CFCs in the atmosphere!

324
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,460
Point! [DING]

325
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,920
Absolutely right!

326
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,360
What a ****!

327
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,580
I think on a list of people who shouldn't have bothered...

328
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,280
He's on it!

329
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,440
Can you imagine, wherever one might end up,
beyond the icy veil of the hereafter

330
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,080
He's sat there. 'So what did you do in life?'.
'Well I invented leaded petrol...'

331
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,400
'Right and ...'
'But then I moved on to putting lots of more dangerous

332
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,420
chemicals in the atmosphere, after that.'

333
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,880
All of our problems now, are his fault!

334
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,740
Are his fault.

335
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,740
This is the thing. What did CFCs, and what did
all the new stuff, the Freon and things he put in fridges...

336
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,940
...fix?

337
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,300
What was there before?

338
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
What's more dangerous than that?

339
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,940
What's more immediate. If you didn't know,
because to be fair, they didn't know...

340
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,420
what would happen with CFCs.

341
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,540
If you don't know that. 
What are they a safe alternative to?

342
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,660
Some other kind of gas that's cooling

343
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,540
Ammonia.

344
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,220
[CHORUS] Ah!

345
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,480
Ammonia is very good at being compressed.
And as a heat exchanger, it's pretty much unparalleled.

346
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,480
But it is extremely toxic and 
extremely unsafe and a little bit...

347
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,820
There are some alternatives.
I've got chloromethane or propane.

348
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Ooh! Propane powered fridge!

349
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes! That's...

350
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,220
It's not ideal.

351
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,420
Electrical fault...

352
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes. That was one of the problems with it.

353
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,100
You are just coming back to lots of houses with holes in their roofs, where the fridges went upwards.

354
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
That kind of thing.

355
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,180
If it's good enough for Indiana Jones...

356
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,800
Yes. He basically invented the idea of using CFCs as refrigerants, and then into aerosol spray cans.

357
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,680
And... things like that.

358
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,000
-And he won medals for this, because, to be fair...
-Oh, he would have.

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,260
-They did...
-Better than the alternative.

360
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,500
Better than the alternative, but the 
long term consequences weren't known

361
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,220
The King's Medal for Environmental ****ery, I think.

362
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,460
He's actually on an interesting list, in Wikipedia.

363
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,800
because the manner of his death

364
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,740
is also somewhat unusual.

365
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,660
Is he on the list of unusual deaths on Wikipedia?

366
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,320
He is.

367
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,700
Auto-erotic asphyxiation?

368
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,620
You're right on two words there. Auto and asphyxiation.

369
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,200
He didn't do an Isadora Duncan, did he?

370
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,120
You are going to have to explain that reference.

371
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,420
Isadora Duncan, Nineteen, twentieth century actress, was killed by her scarf becoming entangled in

372
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,500
the back wheel. Her long scarf in an open top car, becoming entangled in the back wheel.

373
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,780
I thought you said Wizadora.

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,600
Very different.

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,160
He contracted polio, at 51.

376
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,220
Which left him quite severely disabled.
So he's an inventor.

377
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,680
He's bed ridden.

378
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,340
He didn't invent the iron lung did he?

379
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,860
No, the motorised bed.

380
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,060
He's got a grabby system of 
a series of ropes and pulleys.

381
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,720
Point. [DING]

382
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,900
And he accidentally roped and pulley'd himself.

383
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,780
Point again [DING]

384
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,260
Absolutely right. He invented an 
elaborate system of strings and pulleys...

385
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,760
and he got entangled in it, 
and there was nothing he could do about that.

386
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,420
That is a heck of a way to go!

387
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,100
Did he end up getting buried in lead?

388
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,480
Lead casket, yeah.

389
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,900
I doubt it?

390
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,620
With a lot of coolant.

391
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,480
They buried him in a fridge.

392
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,940
-Lead fridge.
-A lead fridge.

393
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,640
So at the end of the show. Congratulations Matt.

394
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm giving you the win here.

395
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,980
You win a hellbound Ford Transit,

396
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,260
previously owned by a Belgian action star, 
that's had a genetic copy made of its mandible.

397
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,640
Van Damme's... van...?

398
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,020
Van Damme's damned van...

399
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,580
and...

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
something.

401
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,460
It's Jean Claude van Damme's 
damned clone-jawed van.

402
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,560
I tried!

403
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,220
So congratulations there.

404
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,000
With that, we say goodbye to Chris Joel.

405
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,980
To Gary Brannan.

406
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,440
To Matt Gray.

407
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,140
Bye bye YouTube.

408
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,120
I've been Tom Scott and we'll see you next time.

409
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
