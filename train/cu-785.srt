1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,280
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,120
Chinese trademark laws can’t trump Trump!

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,650
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,740
Appealing:

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,049
A word I’m sure we all associate

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,949
with President Trump.

8
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,650
And he’s been appealing in China

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,690
for more than a decade.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,690
That is,

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,930
appealing for the trademark rights

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,930
to the Trump name.

13
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,320
In 2006,

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,510
Trump applied for the rights to trademark
his name

15
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,000
for construction services in China.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,390
But it was rejected,

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,540
because a Chinese businessman

18
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,510
had applied for the Trump name first

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,930
in the construction realm.”

20
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,211
Wait, a Chinese businessman owned the trademark

21
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,950
to to the Trump name?

22
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,540
How did that happen?

23
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,620
Well, there are 225 trademarks in China

24
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,879
involving the name, Trump.

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,629
Everything from Trump toilets,

26
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:53,640
Trump condoms,

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,100
Trump pacemakers and even a

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,060
Trump International Hotel.

29
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,360
All owned by other people.

30
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,239
This is especially upsetting to the Trump
Organization,

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,049
since their primary business model

32
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,350
is putting Trump's name on things.

33
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,350
Like buildings.

34
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,350
And magazines.

35
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,350
And steaks.

36
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,360
And chocolate.

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,020
And vodka.

38
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
You know, the usual.

39
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,020
Trademark law in China is kind of like the
Wild West.

40
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,770
All is not what it seems.

41
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,220
In the United States,

42
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,680
trademark laws operate under a

43
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,070
first-to-use system.

44
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,979
That is, if you’re the first to use a trademark,

45
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,340
say, iPhone,

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,369
you rightfully can claim it.

47
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,130
China, and other countries, like France and
Germany,

48
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,000
have a first-to-file system—

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that is,

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,591
you own a trademark if you’re the first
one

51
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:44,880
to do the legal paperwork.

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,149
But in China,

53
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,040
trademark law is applied

54
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,180
with Chinese characteristics.

55
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,930
Hundreds of bad faith trademarks

56
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,360
are on the books.

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,600
Take the iPhone for example.

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,020
No no no.

59
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,979
That might be an “iPhone” in the United States

60
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,009
and most of the world.

61
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,420
But in China,

62
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,120
this is an iPhone.

63
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Sorry, that’s not a Pipe.

64
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,300
This is an iPhone.

65
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,160
And not an iPhone.

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
This happened because a leather goods manufacturer

67
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,980
in China filed for the iPhone trademark

68
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,790
in the, I guess, cheap leather bag category,

69
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,660
before Apple did.

70
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,129
That means in China,

71
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,360
these are iPhones.

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,370
And a Chinese court took a bite out of Apple

73
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,050
when it threw out their lawsuit.

74
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,430
So back to Trump.

75
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,390
The Trump Organization has been disputing

76
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,430
many of those 225 Trump trademarks

77
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,700
for more than a decade.

78
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,700
So far, they’ve lodged

79
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,050
126 trademark applications in China.

80
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,660
Many have been successfully registered.

81
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,060
But the rights to the Trump name in construction

82
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,810
belonged to that Chinese businessman.

83
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,130
And Trump knockoffs are rife.

84
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,290
Even more so than Obama knockoffs.

85
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,430
But probably less racist.

86
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,590
Anyway, the Donald isn’t the only Trump

87
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,110
facing this problem.

88
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,110
But now, Trump toilets,

89
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,310
which are huge by the way, may be in trouble.

90
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,980
As well as many of the other Trump knockoffs.

91
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,310
Because in September,

92
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,629
China’s Trademark Office finally threw out

93
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,629
that Chinese businessman's decade-long

94
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,540
claim to the name.

95
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,620
And this February,

96
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,690
China’s Trademark Office finally gave the
Trump Organization

97
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,750
the rights to the Trump name—

98
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,420
at least for construction services.

99
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,450
And just last week,

100
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,660
38 new Trump trademarks were awarded

101
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,950
to the Trump Organization.

102
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,950
That covers everything from

103
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,030
“hotels to insurance to bodyguard

104
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,040
and escort services.”

105
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,230
Wait, escort services?

106
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,140
Now before you get your knickers in a twist

107
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,400
that the Trump Organization was approved

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,581
for a Trump trademarked escort service

109
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,360
on International Women’s Day,

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,460
it’s not what you think.

111
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,670
That ad was for an Australian based company

112
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,391
that used the Trump name for its escort service

113
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:57,900
in 2007.

114
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,150
And—sorry be the bearer of boring news—

115
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,519
it has no ties to the actual Donald Trump.

116
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,560
Nonetheless,

117
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,340
to prevent someone setting up

118
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,190
their own Trump escort service in China,

119
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,549
the Trump Organization preemptively registered

120
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,950
the trademark.

121
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,520
Hmm, maybe I should preemptively register

122
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,299
a China Uncensored escort service.

123
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait...

124
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,940
I feel like that could be misinterpreted.

125
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,820
Anyway, the Trump Organization

126
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,660
wants to better manage its brand image

127
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,370
around the world.

128
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,320
So everyone was happy with the trademark win

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,680
and there has been no controversy.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,780
I’m just kidding,

131
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,150
of course there was controversy!

132
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,259
It involves Donald Trump.

133
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,259
If you look up controversy

134
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,880
in the Merriam Webster dictionary,

135
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,860
there’s an image of him.

136
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,110
Uhh, actually that’s not as far-fetched
as it sounds.

137
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,850
You see the Chinese courts are controlled

138
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,190
by the Chinese Communist Party.

139
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,900
So the decision to grant the Trump organization

140
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,430
trademark rights after ten years

141
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,710
had to have come from high up.

142
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,070
But ethics critics say it could look like
China

143
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,210
gave something of great value

144
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,330
and will want something in return.

145
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,060
Some jumped to the conclusion that

146
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,360
Trump’s trademark victories were a result of

147
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,500
a phone call between President Trump

148
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,700
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping just a week
before.

149
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,580
"Hello?

150
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,630
President Xi?

151
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,300
Listen, America and China.

152
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,310
A tremendous relationship.

153
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,560
The best relationship.

154
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,080
If I get my stuff back."

155
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,880
But there’s another possible explanation
too.

156
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,270
It seems like some attempts at trademark reform

157
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,240
might actually be happening in China.

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,310
In January,

159
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,699
“the Supreme People’s Court released guidelines

160
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,539
that prohibited trademarks for names of public
figures

161
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,120
in fields such as politics and culture.”

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,710
Since the President Trump is a former businessman,

163
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,980
there’s also the issue of trust.

164
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
A word I’m sure we all associate

165
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,560
with President Trump.

166
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,190
Namely, the trust that he set up to give control

167
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,050
over his business empire to his sons.

168
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,990
What are the specifics of the Trust,

169
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,990
and how much control

170
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,580
does President Trump have?

171
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,710
Well, they didn’t give details,

172
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,260
but hey, they don’t call it a trust for
nothing.

173
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,460
Legally speaking,

174
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,139
Donald Trump isn’t supposed to have influence
over it

175
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,880
until he leaves office.

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,990
So it's unlikely that he actually asked Xi

177
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,190
to give his stuff back.

178
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,190
And realistically,

179
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,009
the trademark win for the Trump Organization

180
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,289
has been a decade in the making

181
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,520
and probably would have been granted

182
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,949
a long time ago if the Chinese court system

183
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,600
weren’t so unfair to foreign companies.

184
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,850
However, it’s possible that the Communist
Party

185
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,400
is pushing this forward

186
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,259
to try to get influence over Trump.

187
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,039
After all, that kind of tit for tat

188
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,930
is how business is done in China.

189
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,240
But don't panic.

190
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,070
Because even if the Party intended to grant
the trademarks

191
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,880
as a favor that Trump would then feel obligated
to repay,

192
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,039
come on.

193
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,620
Trump's not going to feel obligated to repay
them.

194
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,640
He'd probably think that the Chinese officials

195
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,509
are just finally showing him the respect

196
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,150
that he deserves for his strong leadership.

197
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,539
Major backfire.

198
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,610
What it does mean, though,

199
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,480
is I got to file for the trademark to

200
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,919
China Uncensored toilets.

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,470
“Take a seat for democracy!”

202
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,240
So what do you think of the Trump Organization's

203
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,560
trademark victory in China?

204
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,389
Will that give the Chinese regime leverage

205
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,490
over President Trump?

206
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,919

207

And remember,

208
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,509
it’s viewers like you who

209
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,970
support China Uncensored on Patreon.

210
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,970
If you can,

211
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,660
consider making a contribution.

212
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,509
The link is below.

213
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,210
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

214
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,460
See you next time.
