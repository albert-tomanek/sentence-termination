1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
The World Health Organization

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,440
Is being accused of a conflict of interest

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,680
Plus the latest battlefront\h
between China and Taiwan

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,320
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Be sure to like this video and remember,\h\h

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,840
YouTube is secretly unsubscribing people from\h
the show, so make sure you’re still subscribed.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,400
Here are this week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,280
The World Health Organization is under scrutiny.\h
It’s over their recent investigation in Wuhan,\h\h

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,480
China. They sent a team to Wuhan to\h
investigate the origin of the coronavirus.\h\h

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,840
Which is hard to do more\h
than a year later, but hey,\h\h

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,960
the Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t\h
let them in until now. For some reason.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,240
The WHO probe was a propaganda win for the\h
Chinese Communist Party. The investigation team\h\h

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,160
praised Chinese officials for\h
their coronavirus response.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
And they said it was very unlikely\h
the coronavirus leaked from a lab.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
Why, that’s what the Chinese Communist\h
Party has been saying all along!

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Another Communist Party talking\h
point the WHO backed up:\h\h

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,480
They said it was possible the coronavirus spread\h
to humans through shipments of frozen food.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
Of course, Chinese state-run media had a field day\h\h

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,480
with all of these glowing comments,\h
while other countries were\h\h

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,960
a bit more critical. That’s when the WHO came out\h
and tried to walk their comments back...slightly.

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
In an interview with Science\h
Magazine, the WHO mission chief\h\h

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
talked about how “politics\h
was always in the room.”

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,040
He hedged on the lab leak hypothesis, saying\h
that the WHO hadn’t definitively ruled it out.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,480
And he clarified that while it’s possible that\h
the coronavirus is being transmitted through\h\h

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,640
frozen food now, it was “not a possible\h
route of introduction” to China in 2019.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
And when the reporter asked whether they had\h
just given a PR win to the Chinese authorities,\h\h

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,840
the mission chief defended the WHO team,\h
saying they’re not naive about politics.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,880
I don’t think the problem is\h
that the WHO is too naive.\h\h

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,760
The problem is that they know all too well how\h
to operate under the Chinese Communist Party.\h

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,320
For example, the WHO experts\h
had to be approved by Beijing\h\h

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,040
before they went. And some are now saying\h
the WHO has a conflict of interest.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,400
US Senator Marsha Blackburn wrote this letter to\h
President Biden saying, “Concerns have been raised\h\h

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
regarding the manner in which World Health\h
Organization investigators were chosen to\h\h

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,920
study the outbreak and some of the conflicts\h
of interest that exist in those investigators.”

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,880
One of those experts Beijing\h
approved is Dr. Peter Daszak.\h\h

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,000
We’ve talked about him before.\h
Since the beginning of the pandemic,\h\h

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
Daszak has been saying there’s no way\h
the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab.\h

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,480
Turns out, he’s been a longtime collaborator\h
with the lead doctor of that Chinese lab.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
Another person on the WHO’s “investigation” team:\h\h

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,720
Marion Koopmans. Here’s her page on the\h
provincial Center for Disease Control\h\h

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,400
and Prevention in southern China’s Guangdong\h
Province—where she’s listed as a consultant.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,600
And funny enough, she’s also been praising\h
China’s response to Covid since the beginning.

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,240
But in addition to those Beijing approved\h\h

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,120
foreign experts, the investigation\h
team aslo included 17 Chinese experts.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,640
And Jamie Metzl, who is an World Health\h
Organization advisor, criticized the WHO for,\h\h

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,600
well, not actually doing an investigation.

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,680
“The investigation itself was very short. It was\h
two weeks of quarantine and two weeks of meetings,\h\h

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,960
but the actual investigation was done by\h
Chinese authorities. And so, the W.H.O.\h\h

49
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,400
investigators were basically receiving\h
reports from the Chinese officials.

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,760
And why would Chinese officials lie to the WHO?

51
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
So what should be done about\h
all these conflicts of interest?

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,320
Well, in an open letter, more than\h
two dozen international scientists\h\h

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,440
are calling for a new investigation into\h
the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.

54
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,720
In the letter, they say, “The joint team\h
did not have the mandate, the independence,\h\h

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,840
or the necessary accesses to carry out\h
a full and unrestricted investigation.”

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,800
And since the WHO is limited in what it can do,\h
these experts say the international community\h\h

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
needs an investigation “carried\h
out by a truly independent team\h\h

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,160
with no unresolved conflicts of interest and\h
no...control by any specific agenda or country.”

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,320
Yes, that’s definitely not going to happen.\h

60
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,440
But this letter does show\h
that the rest of the world\h\h

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,760
isn’t really buying what the Chinese\h
Communist Party and the WHO are selling.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
And that includes the US.\h
State Department spokesman\h\h

63
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Ned Price . He says the jury\h
is still out on the WHO report.

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,640
And Biden’s National Security\h
Advisor Jake Sullivan\h\h

65
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,880
said “We have deep concerns about the way in which\h
the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation\h\h

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,960
were communicated and questions about\h
the process used to reach them.”

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,760
But after the Biden Administration\h
started questioning the investigation,\h\h

68
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,760
WHO “expert” Peter Daszak tweeted\h
please don’t rely too much on US intel.

69
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Especially any intel about himself.

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,320
In response to all of this negative backlash,\h
the WHO has decided to take responsibility\h\h

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,280
by scrapping their interim\h
report on the investigation.

72
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Because if they released an interim report\h
then everyone would get mad at them again.\h

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
Don’t worry, they will release\h
a full report...later.\h

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,440
And coming up after the break... Biden’s new\h
trade negotiator wants to get tough on China.\h\h

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
But maybe, like, not super tough.

76
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Welcome back.

77
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,840
The Senate Finance Committee has voted to\h
approve Biden’s pick for top US trade negotiator,\h\h

78
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
the US Trade Representative.

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,440
Her name is Katherine Tai. Tai had worked\h
for the US Trade Representative’s office\h\h

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,640
during the Obama administration, including as\h
chief counsel for China Trade Enforcement.\h

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,920
And she actually won two cases against\h
China at the World Trade Organization.

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,480
“I previously served as America’s chief\h
enforcer against China’s unfair trade\h\h

83
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,000
practices and I know firsthand how critically\h
important it is that we have a strategic\h\h

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,920
and coherent plan for holding China accountable\h\h

85
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,600
to its promises and effectively competing\h
with its model of state-directed economics.”

86
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,720
Many have been wondering what exactly Biden’s\h
China plan is. And Tai spelled it out.

87
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,480
“We must remember how to walk, chew\h
gum, and play chess at the same time,”

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,840
Sounds easy.

89
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
But while Tai agrees China is a rival,\h\h

90
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,360
she also said that we have to cooperate\h
with the Chinese Communist Party.

91
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,120
\h“China is simultaneously\h
a rival, a trade partner,\h\h

92
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,000
and an outsized player whose cooperation we’ll\h
also need to address certain global challenges.”

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Which is a stance that the Biden administration\h
has pretty consistently taken on China now. The\h\h

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,000
real question is, what will Biden be willing to do\h
to get the Chinese Communist Party’s cooperation?\h

95
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,680
The Chinese Communist Party is responding to\h
allegations of sexual assault on Ugyhur Muslims.\h\h

96
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,520
By attacking the Uyghur women making those claims.

97
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,720
One way Chinese officials attacked the\h
women was by making public their medical\h\h

98
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,240
and fertility records. But that’s not all. One\h
Xinjiang official said of one of the women,\h\h

99
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,880
“Everyone knows about her inferior\h
character. She’s lazy and likes comfort,\h\h

100
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,840
her private life is chaotic, her neighbours say\h
that she committed adultery while in China.”

101
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,720
The Chinese Communist Party. Their\h
motto—believe women...are lying whores!

102
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,920
And now it’s time once again\h
for my unfortunate catchphrase.\h\h

103
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,920
Hong Kong police have arrested\h
more democracy activists.

104
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,200
“Forty-seven Hong Kong dissidents were charged on\h
February 28 with conspiracy to commit subversion,\h\h

105
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,360
in the largest single clampdown on\h
the city’s pro-democracy opposition\h\h

106
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
under a Beijing-imposed ‘national security law.’”

107
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,440
At this point, every prominent Hong Kong\h
activist is either in jail or exile.

108
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,680
And if arresting huge numbers of\h
Hong Kongers for no good reason\h\h

109
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,080
doesn’t make everyone else there love\h
the motherland, I don’t know what will.

110
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,120
But sadly, Lithuania doesn’t love the\h
motherland. They’re considering leaving\h\h

111
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,840
China’s 17+1 forum, and getting closer to Taiwan.

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,960
This would be a huge blow to China’s\h
plans for Central and Eastern Europe.\h\h

113
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,960
If you want to know more about the 17+1 and\h
how China is using it to infiltrate Europe,\h\h

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,680
check out our recent episode,\h
China’s Big Europe Failure.\h

115
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,880
Speaking of Taiwan, China has announced\h
a ban on Taiwanese pineapple imports.\h\h

116
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,880
It’s not about politics, obviously.

117
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,520
“It was purely a matter of biosecurity.”

118
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
I mean, imagine if Taiwan accidentally\h\h

119
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,840
exported a deadly microbe that\h
harmed people in other countries!

120
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,360
In response to China’s ban, the people of Taiwan\h\h

121
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
bought the entire year’s worth of\h
pineapple exports in just four days.

122
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,960
I always loved those Taiwanese pineapple cakes.\h\h

123
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
Now I love them even more that\h
they’re sticking it to the CCP.

124
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,560
And now it’s time for me to answer a question\h
for a viewer who supports China Uncensored on\h\h

125
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,840
the crowd-funding website Patreon. Go to\h
patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn more.

126
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,440
Charlie W B~Rooke asks, “Chris, Are\h
cute and cuddly Chinese Dwarf Hamsters\h\h

127
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
actually Communist Insurgents\h
looking to infiltrate our hearts,\h\h

128
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,960
and subvert our Freedoms with enslavement to our\h
Pets?!\h Its even more evil than Panda Diplomacy,\h\h

129
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,640
because anyone can go out and\h
buy one!\h ...unlike Pandas...

130
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,080
Oh my gosh. Charlie. You may be on to something.\h\h

131
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,320
Pandas have been China’s diplomatic\h
weapon of choice for a long time.

132
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Now I don’t see what the big\h
deal is with pandas. Disgusting.\h

133
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,280
But one problem with panda diplomacy\h
is that they are, well, giant bears.

134
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
You’re right that Chinese dwarf hamsters\h
are small and portable, and could be in\h\h

135
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,560
everyone’s home, slowly brainwashing them\h
into loving the Chinese Communist Party.

136
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,480
The problem is that while they’re cute,\h
they’re not as cute as pandas. To some people.\h

137
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,840
Which means there’s only one solution: The\h
Chinese Communist Party is going to miniaturize\h\h

138
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:19,200
pandas. Yes, they’re going to genetically\h
engineer giant pandas to become tiny pandas.\h

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,360
And then they’re going to use these tiny\h
pandas to cuddle everyone into submission.\h

140
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,360
What’s that, Shelley? No, we cannot\h
get a tiny panda for the studio!\h

141
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,160
We’re doomed.\h

142
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
Thanks for your question Charlie.

143
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:51,840
And thank you for watching China Uncensored.\h
I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
