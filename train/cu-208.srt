1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,380
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,620
China supports President Trump’s sanctions
on Iran.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,200
In fact, maybe they support the sanctions
too much.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,059
Kim Jong-un goes back to China...

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,320
for a second helping of Xi Jinping.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,720
And finally,

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,160
an official who could have become

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,110
one of China’s top leaders

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,020
gets purged by Xi Jinping.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,980
Bet he never saw that one coming.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,520
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,550
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,550
On Tuesday,

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,410
US President Donald Trump announced

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,630
he was re-imposing sanctions on Iran.

17
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,890
Perhaps no country was as supportive

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,840
as the People’s Republic of China.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,460
Mainly because they’re going to ignore the
sanctions.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,930
My favorite Chinese state-run media,

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,270
the Global Times, wrote,

22
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,050
“Chinese companies doing business in Iran

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,670
will remain in the country.”

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,740
China is the second biggest

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,520
consumer of oil in the world,

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,620
just behind the United States.

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,620
And this year,

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,830
a third of all Iranian oil shipments have
gone to China.

29
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,430
And US sanctions could actually benefit China.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,440
As CNN says,

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,890
“If the new sanctions cause European nations

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,470
to cut back or even stop buying Iran’s oil,

33
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,470
it would leave more crude for China to buy,

34
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,229
possibly at a discount.”

35
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,960
And it’s not just Iranian oil.

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,760
The Chinese Communist Party has been

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,780
doing business with Iran for over 30 years.

38
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,960
And US sanctions are less likely to bother

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
Chinese state-run companies

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,210
that do business there.

41
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,590
Let’s just say,

42
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,770
they have some workarounds.

43
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,650
But there was an even bigger news story

44
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,950
from this week.

45
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,490
How big you ask?

46
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,440
Kim Jong-un big.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,700
So big you can barely see

48
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,520
that island in the background.

49
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,299
“China's state-run media revealed on Tuesday

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,850
that Kim Jong Un had visited Chinese President
Xi Jinping

51
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,220
the day prior,

52
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,830
what would appear to be the second secretive
trip

53
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,640
across that border by Kim in the last two
months.”

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,170
Kim apparently told Xi that,

55
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,149
“He hoped relevant parties would take ‘phased’

56
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,079
and ‘synchronized’ measures to realize
denuclearization.”

57
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,569
Phased synchronized parties?

58
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,019
Kim Jong-un: Vaporwave aficionado.

59
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,459
This comes ahead of the eagerly anticipated
meeting

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,239
between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,819
And remember how the Chinese Communist Party

62
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,909
somehow managed to arrest or kill a dozen
CIA operatives

63
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,069
inside China 6 or 7 years ago?

64
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,090
Well, it turns out,

65
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,989
the Party may have gotten their information

66
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,989
from this guy.

67
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,560
He’s a naturalized US citizen

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
and a former CIA field agent.

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,109
He has now been charged with conspiracy

70
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,510
to commit espionage on behalf of China.

71
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,510
If convicted,

72
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,290
he could be spending the rest of his life

73
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,760
inside a US prison cell.

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
But it could be worse.

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,580
It could be a Chinese prison cell.

76
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,200
And it’s time for another chapter

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,370
in the ongoing soap opera of political infighting

78
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,209
in the Chinese Communist Party.

79
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,689
Sun Zhengcai was once pegged to be

80
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,930
one of the next top leaders of China.

81
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,200
But he was arrested for “bribery”

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,029
and has just been sentenced to life in prison.

83
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:17,120
And let’s be honest, he does look like a
“bad guy.”

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,529
But, you might think,

85
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,340
“By Communist Party standards,

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,620
bribery is not that bad!

87
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,530
Why was he jailed for life?”

88
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,090
Well, as with most of the arrests

89
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,689
in Xi Jinping’s so-called anti-corruption
campaign,

90
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,430
the real reason is that Sun Zhengcai

91
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,480
was close allies of Xi Jinpings’s rival,

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,559
former Chinese leader

93
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,400
and professional Dr. Kamikazi impersonator,

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,169
Jiang Zemin.

95
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,180
And oh yeah Sun allegedly tried to stage a
coup.

96
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
So what do you think?

97
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Leave your comments below.

98
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,739
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

99
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,449
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

100
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,800
See you next time.

101
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,639
And it’s time for me to answer

102
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,510
another fan question!

103
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,790
Coralline Algae asks:

104
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,620
“A while back there were many stories

105
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,089
about China's ghost cities.

106
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,629
Can you give us an update to that situation?

107
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,329
Has China stopped building them,

108
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,919
or are people finally moving into them?”

109
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,540
Great question, Coralline.

110
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,590
The most famous Chinese ghost city is Ordos.

111
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,530
They started building it in about 2005,

112
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,190
but one moved in.

113
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,310
But now, 13 years later,

114
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,420
it appears a few hundred thousand people are
there.

115
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,090
You know, with space for another million or
two.

116
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,700
Incidentally, Ordos is home to

117
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,690
one of China’s biggest Bitcoin mining outfits—

118
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,850
because, you know, land is cheap.

119
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,650
So maybe in another 15 years,

120
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,630
Ordos will be a proper city.

121
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,310
But who knows?

122
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,310
And yes,

123
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,000
local Chinese governments are building

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,630
more ghost cities all the time.

125
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,630
At least ghosts will always have cheap rent.

126
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,980
