1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
I was going to say, is it like of those onesies
that's for two people, so is it a twosie,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,400
but without the bottom bit so it's…

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, what, like a two, like a…

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
A two person jumper with two head holes?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,000
A tumper.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,240
-But only two arm holes.
-Yeah, two head holes.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,800
No, one head hole, two arm holes.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,240
No, two head holes, two arm holes.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
Yeah, one head hole, two arm holes
is a sweater, Gary.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,440
That's just a regular…
that's just a regular sweater.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,320
Is it some high school American pledge ring
Valentine's Day nonsense,

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
that is also, I don't know, connected
with a spree of murders,

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
so it ends up with the word curse appended?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,280
No, but you've just invented
a great horror film there.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,600
-It's like the...
-Or a Goosebumps book!

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,040
It's like the Sisterhood
of the Travelling Plant…

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,280
Travelling plants!

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
-Triffids!
-Triffids!

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,600
I knew the minute that was out of my mouth,
I wasn't going to get to correct myself there.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,640
No.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,480
I've never understood this desire
to make the fabric,

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,200
when there's perfectly good whole cloth
and sewing machines.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,120
You sound like some kind of business owner
of the 19th century.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,960
"Why must we weave these things?"

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm a fine 19th century seamstress,
I'll have you know.

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,080
I can just imagine you coming up with someone
knitting, 'What's that s***? Here!'

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,800
It's two bits of material, brrum, brrum,
chop, poncho, done.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,360
"For this we have machines. Next."

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Do you like my poncho description there?

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,960
Brrum, brrum, chop.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
It's two seams and a hole.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,600
It's true though.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,960
You don't need to cut the material
other than the hole.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,120
Yeah, you only need to cut the material once.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm still talking about ponchos!

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,080
Nobody help him.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
For the fickle lover, the poncho curse.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,080
Is that the one night stand equivalent?

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
"I made you a ponch..."

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh, you f***ed off.

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,300
I thought you said pickle.

42
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,800
Pickle! What?

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
I know, that's why I'm sat here going…

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,720
-I mean...
-"For the pickle lover."

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,680
An onion sized poncho.

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,320
-Like a little gherkin with a poncho on it...
-A gherkin can't wear a poncho,

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,640
it's got no shoulders.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
It'd just shoot straight through the middle.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
"You ungrateful f***!"

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
You'd have to make it an umbrella.

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,960
Alright, or a full height but stiff poncho.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,880
So the bottom corners sit on the ground
and then the head's just pokingup...

53
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
A tent?

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
Yes!

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,920
-No, no.
-Pickle tents.

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,760
"Darling, I made you a pickle tent,
finally we can be briny lovers!"

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,560
Bloody cornichons,
they always leave you.

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,600
That's like my first law of everything,
which is don't be a knob.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
That's basically 'do unto others'.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Yeah, yeah, it's don't be a knob,

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,960
you're going to claim expenses?
Don't be a knob, you'll be fine.

62
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,640
Going to travel...

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,760
Going to travel first class? don't be a knob in
there. It just works. Don't be a knob.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
-Don't.
-And if you are a knob, stop it.

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,780
Yeah, you.

66
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,480
-No, not you, you.
-You. You.

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
-You, Nigel. 
-We see you.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
I don't actually know anyone called Nigel.

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,280
Three people who are called Nigel just...

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,840
One of which is Farage
and he has a massive change after this.

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,480
Oh, yeah, you think Farage watches this?

72
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
He f***ing might as well.

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,800
The wheel spins and lands on France.

74
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,440
Charming image of aliens from Dr Who,
knitting.

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Cybermen have their own
kind of attachment.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,320
-Yes.
-No, that's just a loom.

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,480
That's just, yeah, both arms are there.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,440
What else do you do on long space journeys,
knit each other jumpers?

79
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,560
And then in the end when they land
and try and take over,

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,720
they've all fallen out with each other already.

81
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,880
"This does not suit me.

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,640
"How can this not fit, we are all the same
size and shape."

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
"We have four arms,
why have you knitted only two?"

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
"Why are they both on this side?"

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,720
"Who else are you seeing, Janet?"

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,720
You could use a Dalek as the spindle thing,
the...

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,840
"I cannot feel I am
subjective in this relationship."
