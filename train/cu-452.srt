1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,970
Everyone loves Reddit!

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,880
Especially Chinese tech companies.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,690
Tencent is investing millions in Reddit.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,920
Which is weird, because Reddit is blocked
in China.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,740
So what’s their real motivation?

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,240
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,460
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,460
Reddit.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,000
The tech company that calls itself

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,869
the “front page of the internet”

11
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,630
is looking to expand it.

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,239
Reddit has just raised 300 million dollars

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,610
in the company’s fourth round of funding.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,079
Half of that is from a major Chinese tech
company.

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,410
But who cares if it’s from a Chinese company?

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,309
Because this round funding puts Reddit’s
valuation

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,699
at an astronomical 3 billion dollars.

18
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,079
Now that’s a lot of money,

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,780
especially if you consider what Reddit actually
is.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,730
It’s basically a no-frills online message
board

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,480
where people create discussion threads called
Subreddits

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,179
and then vote up or down posts

23
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,810
they think are awesome or lame.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,380
Example—a Subreddit called ‘funny’.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
Where Reddit user B_rodriguezzz

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,060
posted a photo captioned

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,300
Jamaican Super Lotto winner taking NO CHANCES

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,479
...was upvoted by 119 thousand people.

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,670
Or the Subreddit “Who’s the dumbest person
you’ve ever met?”

30
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,540
which features a post by a teacher

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,700
about a 9th grade student who allegedly

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,509
“ate an entire 24 pack of crayons,

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,509
puked,

34
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,540
and then did it again the next day”

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,159
and “tazed himself in the neck before a
football game.”

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,480
NoahtheRed’s post was upvoted nearly 18
thousand times.

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,719
Anyway, you get the idea.

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,280
This company is worth 3 billion dollars.

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,390
And that’s of course why Chinese tech giant
Tencent

40
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,490
is investing a whopping $150 million in Reddit.

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,789
Tencent is headed by Ma Huateng,

42
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,649
also known as Pony Ma...

43
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,979
Who’s apparently trying to figure out exactly

44
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,509
why offering to invest 150 million in Reddit

45
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,510
has sparked such a torrent of fury.

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,220
See, Reddit users started rebelling

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,890
as soon as they heard about the Chinese funding
deal.

48
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,050
Rebelling how?

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,260
By posting content that would be banned in
China.

50
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Like Tank Man,

51
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,090
the guy who famously stood up to stop tanks

52
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,890
that were rolling out of Tiananmen Square
in 1989

53
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,870
that had just run over pro-democracy protesters,

54
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,610
including these students on hunger strike.

55
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,691
Or also on Tiananmen Square,

56
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,160
but more recently

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,310
police brutally arresting practitioners

58
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,360
of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,650
But not all the backlash is gloomy.

60
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,060
There’s the cheery design proposal

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,230
for Reddit’s new logo

62
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,400
featuring Winnie-the-Pooh.

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,890
The cuddly bear is often censored in China,

64
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,580
because of its obvious resemblance

65
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,180
to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

66
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
But don’t worry,

67
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,930
it’s unlikely Xi Jinping will see

68
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,170
all those Winnie-the-Pooh memes,

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,160
because since last August,

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,670
Reddit itself has has been banned in China.

71
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,130
Now Reddit users are afraid that their beloved
platform,

72
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,970
known for uncensored free speech,

73
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,810
is going to get censored to meet

74
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,570
the demands of the Chinese Communist Party.

75
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,710
See, Tencent has a history of censoring things

76
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,190
the CCP doesn’t like.

77
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,220
Its Chinese platforms QQ and WeChat

78
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,100
are both heavily censored,

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,170
and they work with Chinese authorities

80
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,520
to give them access to user data.

81
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,710
Amnesty International did a report back in
2016

82
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,950
on tech companies protecting users

83
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,440
against threats to privacy

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,470
and freedom of expression.

85
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
The results?

86
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,540
Not so good for Tencent.

87
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,680
“Chinese firm Tencent came bottom,”

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
the report reads,

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,200
“scoring zero out of 100,

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,250
ranked as the company

91
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,450
taking least action on messaging privacy,

92
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,360
and the least transparent.”

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,980
Snapchat,

94
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,720
which Tencent owns a 10 percent share of,

95
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,110
came in third from the bottom.

96
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,920
Who would have thought the app

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,850
that scans millions of users

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,100
with advanced facial recognition technology

99
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,829
so they can wear cute dog ears

100
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,270
would have privacy issues?

101
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,920
But defenders of Tencent’s investment in
Reddit

102
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,870
say that Tencent is a private company,

103
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,750
so there’s no real danger they’d bring
in censorship

104
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,130
or leave a back door

105
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,630
for the Chinese communist party to access,
right?

106
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,480
Well, Tencent is a private company...

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,660
with Chinese characteristics.

108
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,630
What I mean is, in China,

109
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,630
pretty much every company that’s made it
big,

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,470
is only big because it has links to the Communist
Party.

111
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,430
Here’s Tencent CEO Pony Ma,

112
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,920
and another famous tech CEO, Jack Ma—

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,030
no relation—

114
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,170
clapping during a speech Xi Jinping gave

115
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,910
two months ago inside the Great Hall of the
People.

116
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,070
Boy, they were given great seats.

117
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,860
In that speech where everyone was forced to
clap,

118
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,791
Xi Jinping said that the Communist Party

119
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,500
would maintain leadership “over all tasks.”

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,180
That includes tech companies.

121
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,280
Both Jack and Pony were also honored at that
event

122
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,910
for their “outstanding contributions”
to China’s economy.

123
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,610
So yeah, they may be called private companies.

124
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,680
But they’re still under the direction of
the Party.

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,150
According to the Financial Times,

126
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,790
more than 35 Chinese tech companies,

127
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,520
including big ones like Sina and Baidu,

128
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,780
have quietly set up communist party committees,

129
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,480
which “assess a company’s daily operations

130
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,370
to ensure they do not stray from party objectives.”

131
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,460
Think of it like your company’s HR department,

132
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,780
but one that’s working for

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,420
the authoritarian state you live under.

134
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,050
You do not want to get called in

135
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,740
for that performance assessment.

136
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740


137
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
But it’s not all bad!

138
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Xu Zewei,

139
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,010
founder of Chinese fintech platform 91 Finance,

140
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,270
was quoted in the Financial Times article

141
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,100
as saying that “to be affiliated with the
Communist party

142
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,510
is good for our brand”

143
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,830
and “when recruiting,

144
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,350
we specifically seek out party members.”

145
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,470
Trey McArver, co-founder of a consultancy

146
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,590
that advises companies on how to do business
in China,

147
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,389
put it even more bluntly.

148
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,070
“No company,

149
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,440
private or state-owned,

150
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,920
gets ahead in China without aligning itself

151
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
with the party’s larger goals.”

152
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,640
Take a company like Huawei,

153
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,660
the world’s biggest telecom equipment maker.

154
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,330
Not only does it make telecom equipment,

155
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,440
but it also helps the communist party

156
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,800
with little things on the side, like espionage.

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,330
Just last month,

158
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,120
the Polish government arrested a Huawei employee

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,310
on allegations of spying for China.

160
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,450
And federal prosecutors in the United States

161
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,830
are pursuing a criminal investigation of Huawei

162
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,920
for allegedly stealing trade secrets

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
from American business partners.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,389
Investing in US technology

165
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,300
is one of the Chinese Communist Party’s
strategic objectives.

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,020
And it’s not just the well-known companies
like Reddit

167
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,970
that they’re interested in.

168
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,310
Chinese private companies—which, again,

169
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,850
once they get to a certain size,

170
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,240
pretty much all have links to the Party—

171
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,800
have been investing heavily in Silicon Valley.

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,270
That’s partly because they want to get in
on US technology.

173
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,270
Why?

174
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,080
It’s all part of China’s secret plan

175
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,270
to rule the world through high-tech.

176
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,270
Just kidding.

177
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,720
It’s not a secret plan.

178
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
It’s called “Made in China 2025”,

179
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,200
and it’s even been promoted by state-run
media like CGTN.

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
“China has been making great efforts

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,130
to promote its manufacturing industries

182
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,180
since the implementation of the Made in China
2025 plan.”

183
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,100
According to the US Chamber of Commerce,

184
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,699
it’s “a 10-year comprehensive blueprint

185
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,750
aimed at transforming China

186
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,070
into an advanced manufacturing leader.”

187
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,580
Well that doesn’t sound all that dangerous.

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,960
Except experts like Michael Brown,

189
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,130
who runs the Pentagon's Defense Innovation
Unit,

190
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,110
says there’s a big worry in the intelligence
community.

191
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,980
They fear the Chinese regime could get their
hands on

192
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,970
too much sensitive U.S. technology,

193
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,270
transfer it back home,

194
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,270
and pose a threat to American national security.

195
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,070
"They don't play by the same rules that we
do,” says Brown.

196
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,110
“So cybertheft is on the table

197
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,529
and industrial espionage is on the table.”

198
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,680
So China’s big play in Silicon Valley

199
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,640
is about way more than Reddit or Snapchat.

200
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,930
It’s about finding ways to acquire the newest
technologies

201
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,000
and ship them back to China,

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,020
where they can be help China

203
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,280
dominate the world’s tech industries,

204
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,300
inform the Chinese military,

205
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,740
or be useful in the state surveillance apparatus.

206
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,960
And just how big is China’s

207
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,730
big play for American innovation?

208
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,080
This chart from Reuters

209
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,470
shows that since 2015,

210
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,710
when the Made in China 2025 plan was launched,

211
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,920
the amount of Chinese cash

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,470
flowing into US startups exploded.

213
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,180
Last year it surpassed 3 billion dollars.

214
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,010
Now, I’m not saying these investors

215
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,880
are all accessing sensitive technology.

216
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,080
And Chinese venture capital is still a minority

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,390
compared to American venture capital.

218
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,430
But according to Adam Lysenko,

219
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,510
an analyst for the Rhodium Group,

220
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,490
the risk exists that Chinese companies

221
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,029
could access sensitive technology “in an
early stage

222
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,470
where U.S. government,

223
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,610
military and other security individuals

224
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,980
haven't had a full chance to evaluate

225
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,870
the implications of those technologies."

226
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,130
But there is is some good news

227
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,279
on the national security front.

228
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,100
The Trump administration has taken steps

229
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,400
to curb the risk of Chinese investment

230
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
in US technology.

231
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,839
Trump signed a new law clamping down on

232
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,760
China’s access to American innovation.

233
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,839
It broadens the authority

234
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,820
of the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States.

235
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,040
That’s the committee that examines national
security risks

236
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,610
of foreign investments in the U.S.

237
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,240
Already the committee has recommended blocking
deals.

238
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,010
They’ve done that several times so far,

239
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,050
including putting a halt to

240
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,100
a Chinese state-backed company’s attempt

241
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,290
to buy a US semiconductor company for 1.3
billion.

242
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,630
And the administration’s harder line

243
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,270
on protecting American intellectual property

244
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,080
has slowed the flow of Chinese funding.

245
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,100
And those deals have mostly stopped,

246
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,330
partly because of the hassle of having to
deal with

247
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,550
a potential CFIUS review.

248
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,529
So the real danger of Chinese investment in
US technology

249
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,320
is not so much about social media sites like
Reddit.

250
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,220
But, does Tencent’s investment in Reddit

251
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,010
mean that Reddit posts will be censored

252
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,470
to please the Chinese Communist Party?

253
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,600
Right now, it’s unlikely,

254
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,930
unless Reddit wants to get unblocked in China

255
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,839
and is willing to self-censor to do it.

256
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,180
Other US tech companies,

257
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,930
like Facebook and Google,

258
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,050
have been willing to self-censor

259
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,310
to get into the Chinese market.

260
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,480
Which is bad,

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,530
because it normalizes

262
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,060
and legitimizes state censorship.

263
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,240
But Tencent’s Reddit investment

264
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,750
seems separate from that, for now.

265
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750


266
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,410
So hopefully Reddit posts like this one

267
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,640
can escape the long reach of Chinese censors.

268
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,510
Unless Reddit users give it a thumbs down.

269
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,510
And before we go,

270
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,890
it’s time for me to answer a question

271
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,990
from one of you who supports China Uncensored

272
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,390
by contributing a dollar or more

273
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,390
though the crowdfunding website Patreon.

274
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,250
"HuHanmin.. of the Hill People" asks:

275
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,190
"What do you think of the reporting on the
following?

276
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,180
"Guaido has said all lawful agreements approved

277
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,180
by Venezuela's National Assembly will be honored,

278
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,310
a statement widely seen as an olive branch
to China."

279
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,100
Good question, Hu Hanmin.

280
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,540
I think Guiado needs all the international
support

281
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,800
he can get right now.

282
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,279
And given that the Chinese regime

283
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,870
has been supporting Maduro

284
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,230
with money and weapons,

285
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,280
Guiado may feel it’s worth a big compromise

286
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,160
to get the Chinese regime to switch to his
side.

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,190
Frankly, that’s how politics works.

288
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,240
Guido is not in a strong position

289
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,750
to challenge China right now,

290
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,100
even if he wants to.

291
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,910
We’ll have to wait and see what happens

292
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,610
if he actually gets into power properly.

293
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,720
If you want to learn more,

294
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,890
listen to the China Unscripted podcast

295
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,790
where I interview an actual Venezuelan

296
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,150
expert/comedian about this.

297
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,450
The link is below.

298
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,860
Thanks for your question.

299
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
And as always,

300
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,310
I hope all our supporters on Patreon

301
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,620
will continue to leave thoughtful,

302
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,370
interesting questions within each Patreon
post,

303
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,410
so I can answer them on the show.

304
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,260
Thank you so much for your support.

305
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,760
You’re what keeps the lights on
