00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,040
just when you thought it couldn't get any
more complicated

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,280
than a territorial dispute between China,
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,780
and the Philippines, well...

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,720
Indonesia had to show up

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,550
like a...seventh wheel.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
maritime mariner, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:28,599
The South China Sea is becoming a powder keg!

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,059
And who is to blame?!

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,520
"It is exactly one country and let me not
avoid mentioning the name:

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,600
that is, the Philippines…"

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,059
Well, umm, I don't think that's really…

13
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,770
"We are on high alert for Japan's moves in
the South China Sea."

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,859
Ok, no, it's not Japan this time either.

15
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,039
"I suggest to the media that in your reports
you not selectively pump up or ignore things."

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,100
Okay, fine! Everyone's stirring up trouble
in the South China Sea!

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,730
In fact, there is only one country not stirring
up trouble:

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,580
Indonesia.

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,380
"And lastly I reiterate that Indonesia is
not a claimant state in South China Sea issue."

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,980
Finally! A country actually not involved in
the South China Sea dispute!

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,159
It's almost too good to be true!

22
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,650
"On March 19, the Chinese fishing boat was
attacked by an Indonesian armed boat."

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,920
Oh. It was too good to be true.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,880
You see, on Saturday, Indonesian authorities
"attacked" a Chinese fishing vessel in "traditional

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,540
Chinese fishing grounds."

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,009
Of course, by "attack,"

27
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,500
the Chinese Foreign Ministry means Indonesia
fired warning shots into the air

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,149
while approaching the Chinese vessel that
was fishing there illegally.

29
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,909
And by "traditional Chinese fishing grounds,"

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,630
they mean Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone,

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,950
located within 200 miles around the Natuna
Islands.

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,500
Don't worry, I didn't know what the Natuna
Islands were either.

33
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,960
Apparently, they're here, outside the giant
area of the South China Sea covered by China's

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
ridiculously large

35
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,110
I mean, historically accurate

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,940
Nine-dash line.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,480
But a small part of the 200-mile Exclusive
Economic Zone around the Natuna islands does

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,930
overlap with the Nine-dash line.

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,950
Fortunately, Saturday's incident is nothing
like what happened back in 2013,

40
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,590
when Indonesian authorities caught other another
Chinese fishing vessel.

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,650
That time, a Chinese patrol ship came,

42
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,300
armed with mounted machine guns and demanded
they release the boat and crew.

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,660
This time the Chinese coast guard was much
better behaved.

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,470
They merely followed Indonesian authorities
through their Economic Zone,

45
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,670
into Indonesian territorial waters,

46
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,950
then began literally ramming the Chinese fishing
boat until they released it.

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,560
The eight-person Chinese crew is still in
Indonesian custody,

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,870
but China has called for their release.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,510
Now Indonesia has typically stayed out of
South China Sea territorial disputes

50
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,380
partly because Indonesia's waters are so far
away from China, it's kind of ridiculous.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,680
But now, that may have changed.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,390
"With the events which unfolded yesterday
we feel that we were interrupted and sabotaged

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,430
in our efforts and our years of works to promote
peace in the South China Sea."

54
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,100
Wait a minute, Indonesia.

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,570
Your efforts to promote peace?

56
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,170
Didn't you know that China is the one doing
all the peace promotion?

57
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,160
"And, we don't hope to see anymore close-up
military reconnaissance or the dispatch of

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,120
missile destroyers or strategic bombers to
the South China Sea.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,340
This is something we have a responsibility
for under our non-militarization commitment."

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,160
See? Non-militarization commitment.

61
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,120
Except last month, when this was reported.

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,720
"The Chinese military has deployed an advanced surface to air missile system on one of the disputed

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
islands in the south China Sea."

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,020
Or shortly after that.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,330
"China deploys war planes to disputed South
China Sea Islands."

66
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,720
But compared to previous times Indonesia has
dealt with illegal Chinese fishing vessels,

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,880
their response this time has been much stronger.

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,180
"Indonesia will summon China's ambassador
over an incident involving a Chinese fishing

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,160
vessel in the Natuna Sea."

70
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,239
Summoning the Ambassador?

71
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,759
That’s a pretty bold move for a country
that relies on China as its largest trading partner.

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,420
But here's the thing:

73
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,840
China doesn't even dispute Indonesia's territorial
claims.

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,690
"The sovereignty of the Natuna Islands belongs
to Indonesia.

75
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,930
China has no objections to this."

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,980
Yet China insists that their fishermen were
still in traditional Chinese fishing grounds?

77
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,790
I guess there is something to be said for
tradition.

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,590
If everyone just respects each other's traditional
fishing grounds, then we should be fine.

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,780
What's that, Shelley?

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,750
Ok, nevermind then.

81
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,730
But anyway, the biggest problem for China
is that by alienating Indonesia,

82
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,590
they may have lost the closest thing to a
neutral ally in the South China Sea disputes

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,030
disputes that have put China at odds with
pretty much everyone else.

84
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,220
So how do you think this incident will affect
Indonesia's involvement in South China Sea?
