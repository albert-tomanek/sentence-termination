00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,440
the Chinese Communist Party is building a
dangerous,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,410
unthinking killing machine.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,690
Just kidding, haha!

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,550
It's building a dangerous,

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,840
intelligent killing machine.

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,460
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,970
Swarms of killer robots.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,829
It sounds like something out of a movie.

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,480
Actually, several movies.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Star Trek.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,599
The Matrix.

14
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,380
And most terrifying of all, Big Hero Six.

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,500
Now while this may sounds like science fiction,

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,230
humans are disturbingly close

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,560
to making killer robot swarms a reality.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,080
And China may be leading the way.

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,380
What, are you surprised?

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,960
The Chinese Communist Party loves to draw
inspiration

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,500
from dystopian sci-fi movies.

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,090
Like that facial recognition software

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,040
they're gonna use to predict crime before
it happens.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,290
And their plan to rank a billion Chinese citizens
based on their behavior.

25
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,220
Well now, check this out.

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,450
The China Electronics Technology Group,

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,270
a state-owned enterprise,

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,330
just conducted the largest drone swarm test
in human history.

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,500
And drone history.

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,470
Prepare to be terrified!

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,470
It's a bird!

32
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,470
It's a plane!

33
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,430
No, it's a swarm of tiny helicopter drones!

34
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,440
Okay, this footage is maybe not that scary.

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Or...impressive.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,690
But it represents a huge scientific breakthrough.

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,930
It's also a terrifying glimpse into the future
of war.

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,010
The Chinese company got 119 drones in the
air--

39
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,979
all communicating with each other in real
time,

40
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,930
and coordinating their movements faster

41
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,430
and more precisely than human pilots ever
could.

42
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,229
Sure, the US makes drones, too.

43
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,970
Like the Reaper Drones that go for $13 million
a pop.

44
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,420
But drone swarms are in a different league.

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,290
Imagine thousands of small,

46
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,270
cheap drones moving together like a swarm
of locusts.

47
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,710
They have an overall mission,

48
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,150
but the artificial intelligence software allow
the drones

49
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,899
to make micro decisions on their own,

50
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,310
like where to fly at any given moment.

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,810
According to Financial Times,

52
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,490
"Beijing is now betting that swarms of drones

53
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,280
will become a weapon of the future."

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,959
A weapon of the future?

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,959
Come on!

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,270
They look like little toys.

57
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,790
"In theory, such swarms could feature drones
fitted

58
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,940
with missiles or warheads capable of sophisticated
attacks

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,290
designed to overwhelm defenses with their
sheer numbers."

60
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,020
Oh.

61
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,670
That toy is for definitely for ages 18 and
up.

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,400
This could actually give China

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,340
a huge military advantage over the United
States.

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,270
China is rapidly trying to modernize its military.

65
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,220
They're spending about 150 billion a year
to do it.

66
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,630
That still pales compared to what

67
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,100
the United States spends on its military,

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,540
which is about four times as much.

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,470
But an autonomous drone swarm that costs less

70
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,240
than a single US missile could completely
overwhelm it.

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Don't worry,

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,470
the US military is also developing drone swarm
technology.

73
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,739
But the future of military dominance may rest
in the hands

74
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,709
of the country that can make the most cheap
electronics.

75
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,379
And if that's the case, well,

76
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,860
my bet would be on China.

77
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,670
If the US and Soviet Union were in an arms
race,

78
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,740
you could say the US and China are swarms
race.

79
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,660
Swarms Race?

80
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
No?

81
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
How about the Drone Wars?

82
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Overall--beyond just swarms--

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,380
the US military leads the world in military
drone use.

84
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,560
The US has about 7,000 drones.

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
China has only about 1,300,

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,300
and none have been used to attack real military
targets.

87
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,870
The Chinese regime is already putting drones
to use, though.

88
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,210
In July, it released 12 underwater drones
to patrol

89
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,890
disputed territory in the East and South China
Sea.

90
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,379
I wonder if they use technology stolen from
that

91
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,520
US underwater drone they stole back in December.

92
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,950
And Chinese companies are also making drones
for civilian use.

93
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,080
But in some cases,

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,900
they "have been co-opted to work for the PLA."

95
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,380
According to state-run media,

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,840
an online Chinese retailer says it has a drone

97
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,070
capable of making deliveries weighing about
450 pounds.

98
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,650
Which, let's face it, means it could carry
a 450 pound bomb.

99
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,050
Or a basket of 450 one-pound bombs.

100
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,820
And of course, who could forget that the Chinese
Communist Party

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,750
is already using drones to hunt down Tibetans

102
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,960
trying to flee the country.

103
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,940
But that's just the conventional drone technology
they're working on.

104
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,850
A drone swarm is something very different--

105
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,080
because it involves much more complex artificial
intelligence.

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,660
Drone swarms could change how wars are fought,

107
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,610
and they and bring with them a lot of serious
ethical questions.

108
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,889
For a drone swarm to be functional,

109
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,300
the drones have to communicate with each other
in real time.

110
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,900
That's a tremendous amount of data that a
human operator

111
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,690
wouldn't be able to manage.

112
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,470
So individual drones need to be able to communicate

113
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,350
with each other and make split second decisions

114
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,350
as a group.

115
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,699
Kind of like a school of fish.

116
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,420
Fish equipped with bombs.

117
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,420
In other words,

118
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,360
you really need drones with artificial intelligence.

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,950
Now this technology doesn't fully exist yet,

120
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,810
but it is being developed.

121
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,550
And this raises an ethical question:

122
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,640
Once the autonomous drones are smart enough

123
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,750
to move around on their own and find targets,

124
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,590
what happens next?

125
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,740
What if that drone is designed to fire a missile

126
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,360
or drop a bomb?

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,520
Will there be a human in a room somewhere

128
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
who makes that decision,

129
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,180
or will the drone make that call on its own?

130
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,090
Now this is a huge debate in the West.

131
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,090
After all,

132
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,810
when drones can decide on their own to kill,

133
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,410
what once might have been called a war crime

134
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,760
could now be written off as a glitch.

135
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,289
First degree drone-slaughter.

136
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,310
That's why science and technology gurus

137
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,010
have been expressing concern.

138
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,070
Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking are among the
many

139
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,630
who have been outspoken,

140
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,430
calling for bans on killer AI.

141
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,680
This kind of public debate

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,960
is what happens in the West where governments

143
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,610
are held accountable by the people.

144
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,150
The same can't be said for the Chinese Communist
Party.

145
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,310
It's easy for the regime to censor a public
ethics debate,

146
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,039
or to simply ignore people's feelings when
making decisions.

147
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,530
The silver lining is,

148
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,560
there is one big obstacle to China

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,210
developing swarms of killer drones:

150
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,520
The Chinese military itself.

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,550
The People's Liberation Army is more of a
political organization

152
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,990
than a modern military.

153
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,830
Generals are Communist Party officials,

154
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,960
most of whom have never seen combat.

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,669
And so they're more concerned about fighting

156
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,080
for their own political power within the military,

157
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,130
rather than establishing a capable fighting
force.

158
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,880
This problem has made it difficult for the
army

159
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,110
to adapt new technology or change its structure,

160
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,490
since that would mean shuffling people around,

161
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,130
and they'd fight for every bit of power.

162
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,590
According to the Financial Times,

163
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,740
"the competition for resources and funding
is intense

164
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,960
amid a radical overhaul of the services.

165
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,380
Military leaders want expensive planes

166
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,639
and ships that rival American weapons."

167
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,009
So even if the Chinese regime is able to develop

168
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,740
killer swarms of drones,

169
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,069
its own generals might not be willing to use
them.

170
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,389
But the future of cheap,

171
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,380
autonomous drone swarms could rewrite

172
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,270
the rules of modern warfare,

173
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,800
making the US military,

174
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,010
with its expensive top-heavy hardware,

175
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,210
vulnerable to an attack by a smaller,

176
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,460
more nimble opponent.

177
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,930
Or 10,000 small, nimble opponents.

178
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,389
Maybe international pressure can force

179
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,509
even the Chinese regime to put restrictions

180
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,770
on the use of autonomous drones in war.

181
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,639
But since the Chinese Communist Party has
already

182
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,610
shown a love of Minority Report,

183
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,330
there's nothing stopping it from using them
against the Chinese people.

184
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,410
What do you think?

185
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,759
Leave your comments below.

186
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,430
Along a some photos of yourself,

187
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,259
so the drones can find you.

188
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,770
Once again I'm your host Chris Chappell,

189
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,960
see you next time.

190
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,300

195
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,180
sometimes about pandas.

196
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,770
Pandas are cute and cuddly.

197
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,009
Pandas will protect you from the drone swarms.

198
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,189
The pandas are absolutely not robots themselves,

199
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,739
waiting to strike when you're most vulnerable.
