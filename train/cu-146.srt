00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,010
will China become the next Syria?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,259
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,799
Oh say can you see,

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,820
by the dawn's early light,

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,830
the deep shadow of the Stars and Stripes?

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,720
The Chinese Communist Party sure can.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,800
And it wants the Chinese people to as well.

9
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:36,670
That footage is of the five-year nightmare
that is the Syrian Civil War,

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,190
and not China.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,789
But it could be China!

12
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,629
If the evil Western Powers have their way.

13
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,879
This video was posted by China’s Supreme
People’s...Procuratorate?

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,579
It’s kind of like China’s Attorney General.

15
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,110
This is the office that officially enforces
China’s arbitrary laws.

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,629
You see, “Currently China is peaceful and
stable,”

17
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,640
but if the US has its way,

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
China could become the next Syria!

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,100
Are you Syria-ous?!

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,320
Hey, it doesn’t have to be Syria.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,580
It can be any place of political strife:

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,480
Iraq, Ukraine, Turkey,

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,490
or whatever’s going on in this unexplained
scene

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,410
from Batman versus Superman.

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,310
Seriously, can someone please tell me what
that was all about?

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,140
So how is the US planning to turn China into
the next Syria?

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,840
Is it by sending US presidential aides to
meet with top Chinese leaders?

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Oh no!

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,530
It’s far more insidious.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,450
You see, some people claim to have legitimate
concerns

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,770
about how the Communist Party governs.

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,290
Like, Chinese human rights lawyers.

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,970
Or ethnic minorities, like Tibetans.

34
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,780
Or the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan,

35
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,450
who are at a very real risk of having their
freedoms

36
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,360
encroached upon by Mainland China.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,090
But it’s not like these groups have real
concerns that should be addressed!

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,500
They’re phony concerns, part of the hostile
US agenda.

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,460
Wow, that was some scary choral music.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,120
I also like how they paint Joshua Wong,

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,280
the 19-year-old Hong Kong student activist,

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,450
as if he were a Mad Max villain.

43
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,069
The video goes on to accuse Western powers
of using

44
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,269
"democracy, freedom," and, even worse, "rule
by law"

45
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,600
to overthrow countries like

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,099
the Soviet Union.

47
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,760
Yes, that's exactly how it happened.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,499
The ultimate aim of the video?

49
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:43,590
Warning people to stay alert and protect China
from color revolutions, by...

50
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,810
studying hard in school and working hard at
their jobs,

51
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,939
especially if they are scientists.

52
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,109
It's like the video was made by two hardline
Chinese military generals

53
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:55,239
and Tiger Mom, Amy Chua.

54
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,780
Who probably shamed the generals

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,249
because they couldn't play piano,

56
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:00,269
and then made them call their mothers.

57
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,610
What's that, Shelley?

58
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,940
The person who actually made the video

59
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,790
is a Chinese PhD student studying International
Relations in Australia?

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,469
Listen up, Lei Xiying, I've got a bone to
pick with you.

61
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,840
Why didn't I make it into that propaganda
video?!

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,950
Because I’m actually backed by a subversive
foreign force:

63
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,800
You, my 50-Cent Army!

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,099
So what do you think of the United States’
plan to turn China into Syria

65
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,829
by backing separatist forces like evil human
rights lawyers?

66
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,450
And what color would your revolution be?

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,819

68
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,950
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

69
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,439
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

70
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,879
See you next time.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,300
Hey, did you like my episode about China’s
Pokemon Go Knockoff—City Elves Go?

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,680
Well I want to give a special shout out to
my friend Wookong,

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,870
as in Monkey King Sun Wu Kong,

74
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,669
for providing the footage of that game.

75
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,159
I was too busy playing the real game to get
it.

76
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,379
You should check out his channel.

77
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,239
It’s a great way to learn about Chinese
culture.

78
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,989
I mean, don’t you want to know about China’s
most famous assassin?!
