00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,800
“It Will Be Bloody”

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
A confrontation between China and the Philippines

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
is brewing in the South China Sea

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,080
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,120
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is warning\h\h

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,840
if the South China Sea dispute with\h
China escalates, “it will be bloody.”

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,880
But first, I have to tell you YouTube has\h
been secretly unsubscribing people from\h\h

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
the show. So make sure you’re still subscribed.\h\h

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
And check back every Monday, Wednesday,\h
Friday, and Saturday for new episodes.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
The Chinese Communist Party claims the\h
entire South China Sea is Chinese territory.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,720
Over the past decade, China has\h
built artificial islands here.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,440
And satellite photos reveal military\h
facilities on some of these islands.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,560
But this is the most recent escalation: Back\h
in March, hundreds of Chinese boats occupied\h\h

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,600
territorial waters claimed by the Philippines\h
and other countries near Whitsun Reef.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,600
China says the Philippines\h
shouldn’t worry. They’re just\h\h

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,320
normal fishing boats, sheltering from storms.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Forgive me if I’m a bit skeptical.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
“These boats are often huge by fishing boat\h
standards, and they never seem to catch any fish.\h\h

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,440
They have automatic weapons\h
aboard and reinforced hulls,\h\h

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,720
making them very dangerous at close range.\h
With top speeds of around 18 to 22 knots,\h\h

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,240
they are also faster than 90%\h
of the world's fishing boats.”

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,320
So the Chinese Communist Party is sending\h\h

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,760
giant, reinforced, heavily armed\h
“fishing boats” that don’t fish.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,440
They were “sheltering” near Whitsun\h
Reef, even though there were no storms.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,760
According to Carl Schuster, a former operations\h
director at U.S. Pacific Command’s Joint\h\h

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,000
Intelligence Center, “No one ‘shelters’ their\h
ships in a storm area weeks ahead of a storm.\h\h

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
If they truly are commercial craft, it is costing\h\h

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,560
hundreds if not thousands of dollars a\h
day having them sit idly lashed together.”

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,880
The reality is these aren’t\h
fishing boats. They’re warships\h\h

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,520
camouflaged as fishing boats. And\h
they’re part of China’s maritime militia.

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,480
Their goal—force the Philippines to\h
surrender their territorial claims.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
We covered the surge of Chinese\h
ships in a recent episode,\h\h

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
China Vs the Philippines, Dangerous\h
Dispute in the South China Sea.

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,160
And now this week, Philippine president\h
Duterte says a confrontation will be bloody.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
The South China Sea dispute\h
is heading towards a crisis.\h\h

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,360
The US and China have both sent\h
aircraft carriers through the waters.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Even France sent a nuclear attack submarine.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,840
The Chinese spotted it immediately.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
And now Philipppine President\h
Rodrigo Duterte is saying he\h\h

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,600
will send ships to assert the Philippines’ claim.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
But he warned in a televised briefing this week\h\h

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,240
that “If we go there to assert our\h
jurisdiction, it will be bloody.”

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,480
However, that might not be as\h
strong a statement as it seems.\h\h

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,400
Duterte is saying he’s already abandoned the\h
region to China as far as fishing rights go.

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
At the same televised briefing, he said\h\h

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,960
“I’m not so much interested now in fishing. I\h
don’t think there’s enough fish to quarrel about.”

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Filipino fishermen might disagree.\h

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Duterte downplayed a confrontation over fishing\h
rights saying in the future he would send “five\h\h

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,920
coastguard ships, and they can chase … They can\h
play with each other, and see who’s faster.”

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,280
Well that’s a pretty cavalier attitude.\h
Kind of different from before he was\h\h

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,840
elected when he said he’d personally jet ski to\h
a disputed island to plant the Philippine flag.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,720
In fact, the Philippine defence chief had to\h
contradict Duterte. Duterte had said “nothing\h\h

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,480
will happen” if the Philippines sends its ships\h
“because we are not in the possession of the sea.”

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,160
The Defense Chief then said, no, we\h\h

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,560
will send our naval ships to patrol the\h
Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,320
So what happened to Dueterte’s\h
it will be bloody thing?\h\h

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Well, that won’t happen unless\h
China starts drilling for oil.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
That would be the only time\h
he’d be willing to act.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,040
And don’t worry, that’s not\h
going to happen anytime ...

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,760
Oh, shoot. They’ve started\h
drilling in disputed waters.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,320
But wait! It’s for purely scientific reasons. It\h
was to “retrieve sediment core from the seabed.”

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Dueterte’s stance on China has been disappointing\h
to people who thought he’d stand up to China.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,760
According to Reuters, “He has repeatedly\h
said the Philippines was powerless to stop\h\h

64
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,960
China, and that challenging its activities\h
could risk a war his country would lose.”

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
There were even rumors the\h
Philippine defense sector\h\h

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,200
was going to withdraw their support of\h
Dueterte. A claim they are now denying.

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
The problem is, China plays a big\h
role in the Philippines' economy.\h\h

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,560
And the coronavirus has given the Chinese\h
regime more leverage over Duterte.\h

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
“Access to vaccines has become\h
a key concern for Duterte:\h\h

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,960
Metro Manila was locked down again last\h
week amid the nation’s worst coronavirus\h\h

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,800
surge and the Philippines currently sources\h
most of its supply from China’s Sinovac.”

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
But unless something is done to actually\h
stop the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,600
they will keep steadily expanding their\h
reach until they control everything.

74
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,960
The good news is that all of the attention\h
on the Chinese maritime militia ships\h\h

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,440
off the coast of Whitsun Reef seems to\h
have caught the Chinese regime by surprise.

76
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,000
Forcing the majority of the Chinese\h
militia vessels to depart the reef.

77
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,720
Last week, the Philippine Coast Guard\h
released this video of Whitsun Reef,\h\h

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
showing much fewer militia\h
ships there than back in March.

79
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,040
Of course, that doesn’t mean the\h
Chinese Communist Party has given up.\h\h

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,040
After all, they’ve built these militia ships\h
specifically to patrol this disputed territory.\h\h

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,200
They just don’t like it when the rest of\h
the world is actually paying attention.

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,400
fans who support us in our fight against the\h\h

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
Chinese Communist Party on the\h
crowd funding website Patreon.

85
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,480
Frenky asks “I have a question I hope\h
you can answer in the next video:\h\h

86
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,760
why did you guys start China Uncensored? What's\h
the story behind it and how did the team meet?

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Ah, great question Frenky. Matt Shelley and\h
I have all been involved in journalism well\h\h

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,120
before China Uncensored. But around\h
2012, I felt like the threat of the\h\h

89
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
Chinese Communist Party was growing rapidly,\h
but it seemed like most people weren’t aware.\h\h

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,760
So I thought, taking a little inspiration from\h
the Daily Show in its heyday, if I brought some\h\h

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,080
humor and sarcasm to China news, it might get more\h
people interested. Shelley joined me early on and\h\h

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Matt joined when we all went to Hong\h
Kong in 2014 for the Umbrella Movement.

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
And the rest is history as it were.

94
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
Thanks for your question Frenky.

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,240
And a big thank you to everyone who supports China\h
Uncensored on Patreon. We could not do this show\h\h

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,520
without you. So thank you for joining us in the\h
fight to expose the Chinese Communist Party to\h\h

97
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,600
the world. If you’re interested in joining,\h
head over to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
