00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,104
China bans Taiwanese pineapples

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,641
In response, everyone is 
buying *more* pineapples

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,950
Welcome to China Uncensored, 
I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,587
Tensions are at an all time high
between China and Taiwan. 

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,190
Especially after the Chinese 
Communist Party took over 
Hong Kong,

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,395
and showed the people of Taiwan 
what “unification” looks like.

7
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,134
The Communist Party has been 
ramping up military pressure on 
Taiwan in recent months.

8
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:41,041
And then, out of nowhere, China 
put a ban on the import 
of Taiwanese pineapples.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,612
The announcement came only a 
few days before the ban—
very short notice.

10
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:51,584
Chinese authorities claim it’s 
an emergency issue of 
biosecurity.

11
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,054
This ban was put in place 
even though

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,356
“All 600-plus batches of 
pineapples 

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:01,027
exported to China over the 
previous four months had 
been approved.”

14
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,329
But China’s spokesperson said, 

15
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,070
“Customs of the mainland have in
various instances found pests in
pineapples imported from Taiwan,

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,906
which would have posed a serious
threat to the mainland’s 

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:18,244
agriculture and ecological 
security had they 
not been intercepted.”

18
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,415
“The temporary ban is a 
scientific biosecurity measure

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:27,520
and is in line with the 
mainland’s laws, regulations 
and standards.”

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,625
And no country has higher 
standards for food safety 
than China.

21
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:39,232
The problem is, mainland China 
makes up 90% of Taiwan’s 
pineapple export market.

22
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,902
It’s worth around 50 million 
US dollars a year. 

23
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:47,240
So the sudden ban was a huge 
blow to Taiwan’s pineapple
 farmers.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,443
So how did Taiwanese 
people respond?

25
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,413
By going bananas for pineapples!

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,652
They bought up the entire year’s
worth of pineapple exports in 
just four days.

27
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:04,624
People began posting photos 
online of huge pineapple buys.

28
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,995
Cooking shows have started 
featuring creative pineapple 
dishes.

29
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,697
Also, bakeries.

30
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,132
And noodle shops.

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,666
And burger joints.

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,003
And ooh, pineapple 
shrimp pad thai.

33
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,771
You know what they say,

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,075
"A pineapple a day 
keeps the doctor away!"

35
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,711
As long as you don’t poke 
yourself in the eye. 

36
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,680
That’s, um, never happened 
to me.

37
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:33,386
This photo caption says
 “Today’s work buddy, the 
Taiwanese Pineapple!”

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,858
And unlike most of my friends, 
my pineapple buddy won’t 
abandon me.

39
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,627
Where was I? Oh right.

40
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,230
"Support Taiwan, 
Buy Pineapples."

41
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,400
I mean, who wouldn't want to 
buy pineapples?

42
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,737
So pineapples have become 
all the rage in Taiwan.

43
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,138
Overseas, too.

44
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:57,143
Japan ordered 6,000 tons—and 
that wasn’t enough.

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,512
This is a Japanese supermarket.

46
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,949
All the Taiwanese pineapples are
sold out. 

47
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,752
I guess no one wants 
to buy Dole.

48
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,623
Taiwan’s representative in the 
US is promoting Taiwan’s 
pineapples, too.

49
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,659
And the American Institute in 
Taiwan, 

50
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,328
which is the de facto US 
embassy there, 

51
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,531
shared a photo of director Brent
Christensen

52
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,968
with creative pineapple decor 
around the office.

53
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,139
The caption says, 
“Have you pineappled today?”

54
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,842
You know it’s a hot trend when 
people start using it as a verb.

55
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:34,080
Don't believe me? 
Just Google it.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,651
And the de facto Canadian 
embassy, the Canadian Trade 
Office in Taipei,

57
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:44,224
Separately shared a photo of 
themselves enjoying 
pineapple pizza.

58
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,360
To which I have to say: 
Pineapple on pizza?!

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,462
Not cool, Canada.

60
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,533
Way to ruin it. Like you 
ruin everything. 

61
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,738
Anyway, the Chinese Communist 
Party’s efforts to punish Taiwan
backfired.

62
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,708
People inside and outside Taiwan
banded together. 

63
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:07,880
And now pineapples have become a
symbol for standing up to the 
Chinese Communist Party.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,849
A sweet ending.

65
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,788
This Taiwan pineapple buying 
spree is a bit like what 
happened last year with 
Australian wine.

66
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:22,428
After the Australian government 
called for an independent 
investigation into the origin of
the coronavirus,

67
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:28,801
The Chinese regime blocked or pu
tariffs on a wide range of 
Australian imports to China.

68
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,705
That included a 200% tariff 
on wine.

69
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:38,511
Chinese state-run media called 
it not a punishment, but simply 
an anti-dumping measure.

70
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:43,883
Also, the Australian government 
had better “grow up or 
face more pain.”

71
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,286
Yeah, totally not political.

72
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,890
In response, there was a global 
call to buy Australian wine.

73
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,128
Politicians encouraged 
people to buy Aussie wine.

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:05:00,600
And even the White House 
featured Australian wine at 
a holiday reception.

75
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,670
Andreas Fulda, an International 
Affairs Expert,

76
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,040
And author of a 
book about democracy in 
China, said.

77
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,144
“The danger of this [to China] i

78
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:16,482
You can’t simultaneously say Chi
a peaceful country that never 
picks fights with people, 

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,251
And then simultaneously say.

80
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:25,024
If Australia doesn’t change its 
political system, legal system, 
foreign policy, education system
and everything else, 

81
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,660
We'll never normalize relations.

82
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,632
I think this wolf warrior 
diplomacy is inherently 
self-defeating."

83
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,669
And yes, he bought some 
Australian wine, too.

84
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:43,276
The Chinese Communist Party’s 
attempts at coercion may work on
people in China who are too 
terrified to respond. 

85
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,181
But outside China, people 
stand up and fight back.

86
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,118
And the rest of the world gets 
to enjoy more delicious 
pineapple.

87
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,755
Can the Communist Party ban 
Taiwanese bubble tea next?

88
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,024
I could really use some 
more bubble tea. 

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,261
And you can even put it on a 
pizza. Canada.

90
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:08,401
And now it’s time for me to 
answer a question from you, a 
viewer who supports China 
Uncensored on Patreon.

91
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,036
John Shultz says: 

92
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,159
Good question, John. 
You’re right. 

93
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,462
Whenever a zoo anywhere in the 
world gets Chinese pandas,

94
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,767
The deal is that the pandas 
still belong to the Chinese 
government.

95
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:46,739
Zoos have to “shell out 
up to $1 million a year 
to rent just one.”

96
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:53,079
And “If any baby cubs are born, 
they pay an additional $400,000 
baby tax.”

97
00:06:53,112 --> 00:07:00,086
And those baby pandas belong to 
the Chinese government, so they 
have to be “returned” to China 
at some point.

98
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,621
Now your suggestion is: 

99
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,291
The US and other countries could
just hold onto the pandas as 

100
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:11,464
Remuneration for intellectual 
property theft, and other things
the Chinese Communist 
Party owes.

101
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,433
That's a great idea in 
principle.

102
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,334
There's just one problem.

103
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,639
If we did that, we’d have to 
KEEP THE STUPID PANDAS!

104
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,541
Thanks for your question, John.
