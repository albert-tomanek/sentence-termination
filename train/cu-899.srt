1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,560
I’ve got SARs!

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,220
You know, Special Administrative Regions.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,219
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:16,810
I’m here in Macau as part of our Pivot to
Asia Tour.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,500
Macau is the often overlooked

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,880
Special Administrative Region, or S.A.R.,
of China.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,320
Like Hong Kong, it’s officially under the

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,460
One Country, Two Systems policy.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,199
That’s where Hong Kong and Macau are officially
part of China’s territory,

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,930
but have their own separate governments,

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,110
and currencies, and border control.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,260
It was the agreement the Chinese Communist
Party made

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,890
with the former colonial powers in charge—

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,730
because, let’s face it, everyone knew

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,230
the system in mainland China left something
to be desired.

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,680
But that’s about where the similarities
between Hong Kong and Macau end.

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,430
And here are 5 major differences.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,320
Number 5: Colonial History

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,240
Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842
after the first Opium War.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,790
The British seriously built up the place

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,730
and made it into an important, and prosperous,
gateway to mainland China.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
But in 1997, the British Empire

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,100
reluctantly gave Hong Kong back to China—

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,680
under the condition that the Communist Party
allow Hong Kong

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,890
to have a high degree of autonomy.

28
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,050
Unsurprisingly, since 1997,

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,970
the Communist Party has been working hard
to renege on that promise.

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,500
Photos from the handover show that 
then-leader Jiang Zemin

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,140
had his fingers crossed behind his back the
whole time.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,290
Macau, on the other hand,

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,780
was under Portuguese influence for more than
400 years.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,740
Portuguese first settled there in the mid-16th
century,

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,520
and it officially became a Portuguese colony
in the 19th century.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,220
It used to be a big trading hub,

37
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,190
but as the Portuguese empire declined,

38
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,510
Macau stopped being as prosperous.

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,980
Macau’s handover to China

40
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,310
happened in 1999 with way less of a fuss than
Hong Kong.

41
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,160
Number 4: Languages

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,180
The two official languages of Macau are Cantonese
and Portuguese,

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,729
even though few people in Macau speak Portuguese
anymore.

44
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,789
Many signs around the city will have Chinese
characters and Portuguese.

45
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,900
But because of the influence of mainland China

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,429
and the influx of mainland tourists,

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,229
more and more people in Macau are speaking
Mandarin.

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,530
Hong Kong, being a former British colony,

49
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,700
has long been dominated by Cantonese and English.

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,720
However, in 2012, Mandarin narrowly overtook
English

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,469
as the second most commonly spoken language
in Hong Kong,

52
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:28,620
thanks to efforts by the Chinese Communist
Party to spread Mandarin,

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,820
especially in the education system.

54
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,500
Number 3: The Economy

55
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,709
The British turned Hong Kong into a world
city.

56
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,849
Today it’s one of the biggest financial
centers in the world,

57
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,019
called one of the Four Tigers of Asia,

58
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,159
along with Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea.

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,319
Macau’s economy is much smaller than Hong
Kong’s.

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,480
It’s also rich, but for

61
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:52,860
different reasons.

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,100
It’s basically Las Vegas on steroids.

63
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,480
In 2013, Macau’s gambling industry

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,150
was seven times bigger than Las Vegas’s,

65
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,609
with a whopping $45 billion in gambling revenue.

66
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,489
Macau is the only place in China where casino
gambling is legal.

67
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,580
So it’s no surprise

68
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,140
that Macau is the 6th biggest tourist destination
in Asia.

69
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,500
But it’s also taken a hit recently.

70
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Because you know how gambling is a great way
to launder money?

71
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,349
I mean, um, I don’t know that.

72
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,509
But corrupt Chinese officials sure do!

73
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,050
But now Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign
has officials running scared.

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,639
Just 12 months after Xi’s visit to Macau
in 2014,

75
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,259
shares of Macau’s six casino operators plunged
by more than half.

76
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,460
Number 2: Macau is the model S.A.R.

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,840
Between Macau and Hong Kong, Macau is clearly
the filial child.

78
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,499
Not like that Hong Kong—

79
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,180
always getting involved in democracy protests,

80
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,349
demanding freedom,

81
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,219
and generally causing trouble for those

82
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,359
hardworking communist officials in
Beijing.

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,200
Fortunately, in Macau, there is almost no
democratic movement,

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,180
let alone an independence movement.

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,280
That’s why Chinese state-run media have
praised Macau.

86
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,650
After Hong Kong’s 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella
Movement,

87
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,390
the People’s Daily published an editorial
saying,

88
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,010
“Macau people are content and grateful.

89
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,780
Hong Kong people are a bit rebellious and
resistant.”

90
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,479
Global Times wrote,

91
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,849
“Political stability is the key to Macao’s
economic development

92
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,009
which ensures social stability.

93
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,209
The One Country Two Systems have maximized
Macao’s development potential.

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,260
And Number 1: Anti-Subversion Law

95
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,360
Imagine police being allowed to burst into
your home,

96
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,190
search your stuff, and arrest you without
a warrant,

97
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,620
just because you’re suspected of “subversion”
of the Chinese Communist Party.

98
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,580
Well, Article 23 is a draconian anti-subversion
law that could do just that.

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,680
In 2003, when Beijing pushed the Hong Kong
government to pass it,

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
half a million Hong Kong citizens took to
the streets in protest,

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,169
and stopped it.

102
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,689
Macau, on the other hand,

103
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,360
passed Article 23 seven years ago—

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,140
with almost no resistance.

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,040
Uhh, wait a minute.

106
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,560
Shelley, am I safe here in Macau?

107
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Ok.

108
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,139
So I’m going to wrap this up.

109
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,110
What do you think are the biggest differences
between Hong Kong and Macau?

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,750
Leave your comments below.

111
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,250
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

112
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,810
and I’ve gotta go back to Hong Kong now.
