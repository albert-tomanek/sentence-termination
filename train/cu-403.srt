1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,920
pack your bags,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,160
we’re going to space!

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,490
I’m your Interplanetary Explorer Extraordinaire,

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,820
Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,590
Space: the final frontier.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,650
And guess which country is going to conquer it?

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,650
After all,

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,680
the legendary Chang’e flew to the moon

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,560
several thousand years ago,

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,080
which definitely makes the moon a part of
China’s sacred territory.

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,119
Wait,

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,700
is that a nine-dash line?

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,890
Take that, Neil Armstrong!

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,020
But as Neil knows,

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,290
getting to space ain’t easy!

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,290
In fact,

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,149
it’s harder than fighting a slew of monsters,

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,050
climbing the sacred Mount Kunlun,

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,560
finding the Queen Mother of the West,

22
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,540
and convincing her to give you the elixir
of immortality

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,640
that will take you to the heavens!

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
First of all,

25
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,020
if you fly an airplane high enough,

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,440
there’s no more air.

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,560
And once you’ve lost the air under the wings
that give the plane lift and control,

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,060
well, flight becomes much, much harder.

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,640
That’s why,

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,970
despite the great technological advances we’ve
made as a species,

31
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,710
the best idea humanity has come up with for
getting into space

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,350
involves strapping yourself to a massive explosion.

33
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,630
And not surprisingly,

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,950
that can go wrong.

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,030
For example,

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,030
SpaceX,

37
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,130
a privately owned aerospace manufacturer

38
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,799
and space transport services company,

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,650
can make a nice video showing how simple interplanetary travel is.

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,780
But when you actually put a rocket on a launch
pad,

41
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,229
things can go bad quickly.

42
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,210
That was an unmanned rocket, FYI.

43
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,119
Space tourism is certainly ambitious.

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,040
But when it comes to making the impossible

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,850
only very improbable

46
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,970
no one beats China.

47
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,740
From the people who said they wanted to build

48
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,810
an underwater train to America

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,790
and a trillion dollar space laser,

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,759
but who still can’t design a good jet engine

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,280
without stealing from other countries—

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,549
comes one of the most ambitious plans in the
space tourism industry:

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,060
A 20-person spaceplane.

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
Yeah,

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,269
that is the most ambitious plan out there.

56
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,450
A reminder that we’re still 200 years away

57
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,029
from building The Enterprise.

58
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:17,269
The state-backed China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology

59
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,519
unveiled this at the International Astronautical Congress

60
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,040
in Guadalajara, Mexico.

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,120
And while 20 passengers may not sound like a lot,

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,180
it is for a spaceplane.

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,379
For context,

64
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,109
Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft,

65
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,400
which is a competitor,

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,269
is being designed for just six passengers.

67
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,299
The Chinese spaceplane design is also big.

68
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,329
The largest design weighs in at nearly 100
tons

69
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,449
with a 40-foot wingspan.

70
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,860
The American space shuttle by comparison

71
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,460
was just 82 tons.

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
The design team claims

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,650
test flights will begin in two years,

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,669
and payload launches in 2020—

75
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,199
the same year Mission to Mars takes place.

76
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,529
So someone’s prediction was off by a few
years.

77
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,199
Spaceflight expert Roger Launius

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,209
at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC

79
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,170
is a bit skeptical of China’s plans.

80
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,639
He told New Scientist,

81
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,029
“It’s not explained how that will be accomplished.

82
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:17,449
And the fact that they think they can test
fly in the next 2 years

83
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,509
is remarkable.”

84
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,639
One of the things that make China’s space
plane concept unique

85
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,099
is that it will all be one piece.

86
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,900
Like footie pajamas.

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,510
It won’t have a separate booster unit

88
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,430
like America’s old-fashioned space shuttle,

89
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,950
nor will with be carried into the air on a
separate craft,

90
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,339
like Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo.

91
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,339
Basically,

92
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,540
it will take off like the rockets of yore,

93
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,150
but land like a space shuttle,

94
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,150
following these comforting circular bright
red lines.

95
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
But anyway,

96
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,760
I’m all for progress in space exploration—

97
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,049
whether the innovation comes from China or
other countries.

98
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,859
But I'm not sure about this whole space plane idea.

99
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,940
You see,

100
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,309
the space plane designers say each ticket

101
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,889
will cost $200,000 dollars or more.

102
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,939
And that could make the airline industry want
to get involved.

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,939
Suddenly,

104
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,109
you’re paying ten grand

105
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,249
for each piece of checked luggage,

106
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,709
you'll have to take your space suit off

107
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,240
to get through the full-body scanner,

108
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,900
and an upgrade to business class

109
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,509
will cost you 100,000 frequent flyer light-years.

110
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,439
That's no way to travel.

111
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,360
But all that is years ahead of us.

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Meanwhile,

113
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,250
China’s space program has lost control of
the Tiangong 1 space station

114
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,099
which is due to crash somewhere on on Earth
next year.

115
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,860
Just something to look forward to.

116
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,419
So what do you think of China’s ambitions
space plane design?

117
