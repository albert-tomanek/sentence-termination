1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,050
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,240
is it war on the open sea?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,380
Lies!

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,180
Betrayal!

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,920
Backstabbing!

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,100
Things are heating up in the South China Sea

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,449
as the Chinese regime has a massive confrontation

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,040
with Australian warships!

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,419
Australia is sending warships through the
South China Sea.

10
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:30,649
The story was first reported by Australia’s
national broadcaster, ABC.

11
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:33,820
An official described the confrontation between
Chinese

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,730
and Australian warships as “polite, but
‘robust.’”

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,010
Yeah, well you know what else is robust?

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,840
Australia’s international engagement!

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,489
Clearly we’re on the brink of World War
III.

16
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,020
And what does Christopher Pyne,

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,239
Australia’s defence minister

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,570
and most annoying man in Australia have to
say about

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,739
the most dangerous confrontation of the 21st
century?

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,079
He said, “I think ‘confrontation’ is
somewhat of a

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,860
tabloid-style description of what goes on

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,310
in the South China Sea very regularly.”

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,780
Did he say, tabloid?

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,390
Uhhh, right, how dare all the media talk about
it

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,950
like it was some big confrontation!

26
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,340
Oh...they’re all calling it a challenge
now.

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
Okay.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,960
Uhh, well...you know,

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
the fine journalists over at the Express in
the UK

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,720
called it a confrontation that might bring
World War III—

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,460
and they’re not a tabloid.

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,060
I mean, look at what other fine reporting
they do.

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,859
NASA SHOCK: Huge ‘alien herd of animals
found

34
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,479
in space probe images of Mars’

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
Or “Monstrous 7ft creature pictured

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
after ‘MURDEROUS RAMPAGE’”

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Oh!

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,109
And “End of the world 2018:

39
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,729
Will the Rapture occur on April 23?

40
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,120
SHOCK prediction says YES.”

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,380
That’s today!

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,600
Very important news!

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,280
I’m glad I have been so well informed...

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,520
Look, it’s hard to make money with news
these days.

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,950
Is it so wrong jazz things up a little bit?

46
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,500
What’s that Shelley?

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,860
Oh, yes it is.

48
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,870
For everyone else.

49
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,740
Not for me, obviously.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,320
This is a comedy show.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,070
Okay, so details of the “confrontation”

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,590
are actually bit sparse.

53
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,560
But what we do know is that three Australian
warships

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,170
sailed through the South China Sea

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,420
on their way to Vietnam.

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,540
The problem is, there’s a wee bit of disagreement

57
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,220
about what’s international waters,

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,850
and what’s part of China.

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,590
See, the Chinese Communist Party says that

60
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,980
everything within this 9 dash line

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,340
is China’s territorial waters...

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,980
...and that it has been since ancient times.

63
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,630
But if that isn’t convincing enough for
you,

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,000
the Chinese regime went ahead

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,200
and built artificial islands in the South
China Sea.

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,570
And put missiles on them.

67
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,420
China’s Defense Ministry confirmed

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,270
that last week’s confrontation,

69
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,370
I mean, challenge, did happen.

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,530
Typically when this happens with American
warships,

71
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,790
the Chinese navy says,

72
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,980
“You’re in Chinese territorial waters,
get out.”

73
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,490
And the American ships respond,

74
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,920
“Uh, no, this is international waters.

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Deal with it.”

76
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,510
In fact, the US regularly engages in these

77
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,870
“freedom of navigation operations”

78
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,569
every couple of months.

79
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,620
That really doesn’t float the Chinese regime’s
boat.

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,950
It’s hard to militarize a region and seize
control

81
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,950
from six other competing claims...

82
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,880
...when the US constantly reminds everyone

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,120
that your navy isn’t all that.

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,090
However, it’s unusual for Australia to do
this.

85
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,850
Especially since China is Australia’s biggest
trading partner.

86
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,120
In the past Australian officials have been
hesitant

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,020
to confront the Chinese regime.

88
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,790
I just hope the Chinese navy made sure to
translate

89
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,060
their message into Australian English.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,700
“Listen up, ya bloody drongos.

91
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,920
This here’s fair dinkum Chinese waters.

92
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,530
No bogans allowed.”

93
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,480
But the relationship between China and Australia

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,060
is not doing so well lately.

95
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,739
Just look at the tension between this kangaroo
and panda

96
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,769
in my favorite Chinese state-run media the
Global Times.

97
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,789
Earlier this month, everyone in Australia

98
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,919
freaked out over news the Chinese Communist
Party

99
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,740
is considering setting up a military base

100
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,449
on the island nation of Vanuatu,

101
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,509
1,200 miles off Australia’s coast.

102
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,870
The Chinese regime denies it, of course.

103
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,039
But several years ago,

104
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,069
they also said they weren’t militarizing
the South China Sea,

105
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,340
and look where we are now.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,780
It’s hard to deny the Chinese regime

107
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,650
has been expanding its military reach.

108
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,569
Not just in the South China Sea,

109
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,830
but also all along the Indian ocean.

110
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,590
That’s the String of Pearls theory—

111
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,800
the Chinese regime is making deals with countries

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
that could eventually mean port access

113
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,300
for the Chinese navy.

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,150
But Australia’s recent freedom of navigation
operation

115
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,300
seems to a way of pushing back.

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,110
Now sure, Chinese state media may have

117
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,930
some harsh words for them.

118
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,319
Like saying that “Australia has a twisted
attitude toward China”

119
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,629
and that Australia really ought to

120
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,639
“work with China and other regional countries

121
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,719
to maintain peace and stability” in the
South China Sea.

122
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,719
But ultimately,

123
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,490
when Australia pushes back on the South China
Sea,

124
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,740
there’s not much the Chinese Communist Party
is going to do.

125
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,260
Yes, they’ve been able to throw their weight
around

126
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,509
with smaller countries in the past.

127
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,590
But times are changing.

128
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,830
Now there’s the threat of a trade war with
the US—

129
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,560
a trade war that Chinese authorities had better
resolve

130
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,600
because China has the most to lose.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,169
So in this political climate,

132
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:51,770
the Chinese regime can’t afford

133
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,520
to play hardball with Australia.

134
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,740
The Chinese economy is already under serious
threat.

135
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,250
And that’s not tabloidy.

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,689
Even top Communist officials are talking about
it.

137
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,249
So if ever there were a time for Australia

138
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,780
to challenge the Chinese Communist Party,

139
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
this is it.

140
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,569
And Australia knows it.

141
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,819
So what do you think about the “confrontation”

142
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,629
between Australia and China?

143
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,389
