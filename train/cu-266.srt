00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,910
the president of the international crime fighting
force Interpol

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,460
has resigned after getting ‘disappeared’
in China.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,320
Hi. Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,060
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,250
The International Criminal Police Organization,
or INTERPOL.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,250
It’s world’s largest international police
organization,

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,680
with 192 member countries.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,820
Sounds impressive,

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,030
but what does Interpol actually do?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,490
It’s like a global FBI, but with one important
difference.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,050
They don’t have the power to make actual
arrests.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,590
As you may have learned from Where in the
World Is Carmen Sandiego,

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,940
Interpol coordinates international law enforcement
activities.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,950
But they don’t actually make arrests.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,820
They get local police to do the hands-on stuff.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,520
For example, the real Interpol coordinates
efforts

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,420
across multiple jurisdictions to fight ivory
poachers in Africa…

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,180
…or help catch murder suspects with some
unfortunate face tattoos

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,619
who may be trying to flee across international
borders.

21
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,460
They issue a number of color-coded notices.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,850
Red is bad.

23
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,549
It’s the closest thing to an international
arrest warrant.

24
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,390
And they do sometimes get their man, like
Triston Jay Amero...

25
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,039
…a mentally deranged terror suspect

26
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,859
in multiple bombings in Bolivia

27
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,780
who described himself as both a vampire

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,889
and “The Superman of Losers.”

29
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:29,999
Sorry Amero, that’s Tommy Wiseau.

30
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,889
So when the president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei,

31
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,100
vanished without a trace a few weeks ago

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,459
while on a visit to China,

33
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,689
speculation ran rampant

34
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,950
that a nefarious crime syndicate with global
reach

35
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,509
had turned the tables on Interpol to get their
man.

36
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,810
But now it turns out that Meng Hongwei,

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,539
who happens to be a Chinese national,

38
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,770
was abducted by none other than...

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,279
the Chinese Communist Party.

40
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:59,709
So a nefarious crime syndicate with global
reach did get their man.

41
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:00,749
Although let’s be honest,

42
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,119
they don’t look as good in a fedora.

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,950
China’s Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection,

44
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,820
the party’s watchdog against graft and political
disloyalty,

45
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,120
said in a statement on Sunday that Meng had
been arrested in China

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,970
and was being investigated on suspicion of
violating the law.

47
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,940
China’s Ministry of Public Security said

48
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,260
“the investigation against Meng Hongwei

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,069
taking bribes and suspected violations of
law is very timely,

50
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,189
absolutely correct and rather wise.”

51
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,739
Interestingly, Meng had a second job:

52
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,500
Vice Minister of Public Security in China.

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,110
I guess not anymore.

54
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,780
Meng was also linked to disgraced former security
czar

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,800
and meat space Thwomp Zhou Yongkang.

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,489
He’s now in prison for embezzling 300 million
dollars.

57
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,730
He got a life sentence.

58
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,730
And worst of all,

59
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,409
they won’t let him keep his black hair dye
in prison.

60
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,230
In fact, the Ministry of Public Security

61
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,340
specifically said that the investigation of
Meng

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,510
was needed to “utterly rectify the poisoned
stream of influence

63
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,739
brought by Zhou Yongkang.”

64
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,790
Viewers of my favorite soap opera,

65
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,890
General Hostilities,

66
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,640
may remember that Zhou Yongkang

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,370
was a big part of the faction

68
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,989
led by former Chinese leader

69
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,340
and mummified toad Jiang Zemin.

70
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,650
His faction is locked in a power struggle

71
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,079
with current leader Xi Jinping.

72
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,240
So it looks like Meng probably had some shady
things going on.

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,099
Not great for the head of an international
crime-fighting task force.

74
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,760
But even more embarrassing is that the Chinese
Communist Party

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,659
arrested one of the few Chinese nationals

76
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,879
who hold important positions in international
organizations.

77
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,790
Back in 2016, Meng became the first ever Chinese
national

78
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,499
chosen as president of Interpol.

79
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,159
His election was viewed as a success for China's
ambitions

80
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,530
to gain influence in international organizations.

81
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,849
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs

82
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,209
said at the time it was a sign that China

83
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,319
was ready to "take on bigger responsibility

84
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,209
and make greater contribution to push for
global law enforcement.”

85
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,969
And then they had to go spoil it all with
a secret arrest.

86
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,239
Reinforcing the view that China may not ready

87
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,999
to lead important international organizations

88
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:15,120
is the fact that for nearly two weeks after
Meng disappeared

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,000
while on a trip to China,

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,630
the Chinese Communist Party refused to admit

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,350
that they had arrested him,

92
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,100
even when Interpol made a formal request for
information

93
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,680
about what happened to their boss.

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,980
It seems what may have prompted Chinese authorities
to fess up

95
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,210
was when Meng’s wife held a tearful press
conference

96
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,320
on Oct. 7 in Lyon, France,

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,930
where Interpol is headquartered.

98
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,650
That’s her in the middle,

99
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,780
with her back to the cameras.

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,560
She said she’s been threatened,

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
and French police have placed her

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,640
and her kids under protective custody.

103
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,220
She told reporters she was speaking out

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,950
on behalf of “all the wives and children,

105
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,210
so that their husbands and fathers will no
longer disappear.”

106
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,810
She showed them the last message she received
from him,

107
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,560
a “wait for my call” text along with a
creepy knife emoji.

108
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,090
At first, I assumed it meant “I’ll be
bringing back

109
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,050
the most amazing set of steak knives!”

110
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,270
But Meng’s wife later said the knife was
their code for danger.

111
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,910
Which is pretty intense.

112
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,770
My code for danger is just a panda emoji.

113
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,150
It’s led to some confusion.

114
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,920
Anyway, after 12 days of silence following
creepy knife emoji,

115
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,670
Interpol tweeted that it had received Meng’s
resignation

116
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,090
“with immediate effect.”

117
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,720
And that Interpol now has a new acting president—

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,880
Kim Jong Yang.

119
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,260
He’s from South Korea.

120
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,340
Actually what I’d like to know is,

121
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,750
how did a senior official from China’s Ministry
of Public Security

122
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,080
get the respectable job of Interpol president
in the first place?

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,250
After all, the Ministry is notorious for

124
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,440
arresting Chinese dissidents without a warrant,

125
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,490
often detaining them for long periods in black
jails.

126
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,460
Which I’m pretty sure is not the way

127
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,050
an international police force is supposed
to operate.

128
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,650
China’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday
that China

129
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,930
would continue to provide support for Interpol’s
work.

130
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,840
But I wonder whether Interpol is really

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,710
all that keen to take them up on the offer.

132
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,900
Because if it turns out the Chinese Communist
Party

133
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,990
feels entitled to detain the president of
Interpol on a whim

134
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,370
and not bother to tell anybody about it for
12 days,

135
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,370
you gotta wonder—

136
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,760
are they really the kind of partner

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,870
you want to have in international law enforcement?

138
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,420
Professor Julian Ku,

139
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,760
a specialist in China’s relationship with
international law,

140
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,030
told the New York Times that while Meng’s
appointment

141
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,660
two years ago was a sign of China’s international
presence

142
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,260
and growing influence,

143
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,150
the fact that Meng was ‘disappeared’ without
any notice to Interpol

144
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,170
will undermine China’s global outreach effort.

145
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,540
He said, “It is hard to imagine another
international organization

146
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,711
feeling comfortable placing a Chinese national

147
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,890
in charge without feeling nervous that this
might happen.”

148
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,470
And if Chinese authorities can do this to
prominent people

149
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,270
like the head of the international police—

150
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,670
or to Chinese superstar actress Fan Bingbing,

151
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,220
who went missing for three months

152
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,080
and reappeared with $130 million in fines
and back taxes,

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,220
along with a deep apology to the Communist
Party—

154
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,760
what it really means is that

155
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,270
when it comes to the Chinese Communist Party,

156
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,950
nobody’s safe.

157
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,430
Especially in a case like Meng Hongwei’s,

158
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,120
where his arrest is likely related to the
power struggle

159
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,110
going on within the Chinese Communist Party.

160
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,970
So what do you think about the president of
Interpol

161
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,170
getting ‘disappeared’ by the CCP

162
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,130
without notice or notification?

163
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,360
Leave your comments below.

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from you,

165
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
a fan who supports China Uncensored

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,290
with a dollar or more per episode

167
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,880
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

168
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,580
Trung Nguyen asks:

169
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,610
“Chris, Is this your official channel

170
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,640
China Uncensored in Vietnamese?

171
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,600
Ah, you’ve found my Vietnamese doppelganger.

172
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,890
He looks like me,

173
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,960
but sounds like a Vietnamese woman.

174
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
It is an official channel.

175
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,340
Many years ago,

176
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,230
they started uploading content about China

177
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,480
from several different YouTube channels.

178
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,960
Now it’s mostly just China Uncensored.

179
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,180
I gave them permission, under one condition:

180
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,240
They make me sound awesome in Vietnamese.

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,950
My most popular episode on that channel

182
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,240
is the one about Mao Zedong's Crystal Mausoleum.

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,980
It got 2 million views,

184
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,480
which is way more than it got in English.

185
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,500
I don’t know how to explain that.

186
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,560
Thanks for your question, Trung.

187
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,840
