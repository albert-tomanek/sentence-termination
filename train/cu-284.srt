1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,010
Famine devastated North Korea

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,330
Ji Seong-ho knew he needed to get out

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,040
But what he found in China, was even worse

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,400
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,180
I bet you don’t usually think a place could
be

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,740
much worse than North Korea.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,750
But for many North Korean refugees,

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,590
life in China is a nightmare.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,640
They have no rights, no voice,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,850
and the women are often sold into sex slavery.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,879
But North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho is trying
to change that.

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,960
And there’s a way you can help.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,680
I sat down with him on the sidelines

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,989
of the 2018 Oslo Freedom Forum in Taiwan.

16
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,380
Thank you very much for joining me today.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,720
So, you were a child when the famine hit North
Korea.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,580
What was the country like during that time?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,940
If I describe it in one sentence,

20
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:03,109
it was like we were hit by a tremendous natural
disaster, or a war.

21
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:10,920
I could see dead corpses who died from starvation
on the street.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,530
Houses were destroyed because people who were
too hungry to go find fuel,

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,890
burned parts of their homes for warmth.

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,710
I also saw many children who were suffering
from malnutrition.

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,850
Getting something to eat was the only thing
on everyone’s mind.

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,250
Can you tell us how you lost your arm and
your leg?

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,399
I couldn't find any food in the mine where
I was living,

28
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,409
so I had to go searching somewhere else for
something to eat.

29
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,060
I mean, I couldn’t survive by eating only
grass and tree bark.

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,869
One way to find food was to steal some coal
from the trains,

31
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,340
and then sell the coal in town.

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,429
I could buy a little bit of dried corn with
that money.

33
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:00,340
Well, one day, I was hanging onto a train
train headed downtown,

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,759
but I lost consciousness because I was so
hungry, and I fell off.

35
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,140
The train ran over my arm and leg.

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:17,129
That’s how I lost my arm and leg and that’s
how I became crippled.

37
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,420
When did you realize you needed to leave North
Korea?

38
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,400
Even after so many years of famine, the situation
wasn’t getting any better.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,349
I learned that the North Korean government
was lying about the situation

40
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,390
when I visited China to find some food.

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,120
I started to think that I have to leave North
Korea to survive.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,660
In 2006, I made up my mind to escape,

43
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,450
even though I knew it would be almost impossible.

44
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,830
China is a critical stop for North Korean
refugees.

45
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,210
How are they treated in China?

46
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,549
China is a horrible country for North Korean
refugees.

47
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,549


48
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,030
If they make one mistake in China,

49
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,220
it can lead to their death by Chinese police.

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,760
It’s ironic since they escape North Korea
in order to survive,

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,069
but end up facing death in China anyway.

52
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,689
Some refugees just want to get some food and
go back to North Korea,

53
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:21,820
and some refugees want to go to South Korea
to seek freedom.

54
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,760
So many people got arrested and sent back
to North Korea.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
So many people got killed and thrown in prison
in North Korea

56
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,930
after they were sent back.

57
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,870
That's why when we think of China,

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:43,489
we think of a country of terrible pain.

59
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,069
What was your experience like getting out
of China?

60
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,260
Is there like some kind of underground railroad

61
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,500
to help North Korean refugees escape?

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,250
There is no underground railroad system for
North Korean refugees

63
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,610
to get out of China.

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,180
Since I couldn't go directly to South Korea
from China,

65
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,360
I tried to get out of China by going through
its neighboring countries.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,140
I used every possible type of transportation.

67
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,440
And sometimes I had to walk for a long time.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,079
I had to get out of China.

69
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,560
If I got arrested in China,

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,989
I knew I would be sent back to North Korea
and would be killed there.

71
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,500
I had to travel in China covertly,

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,110
and it took a long time to arrive in Southeast
Asian countries.

73
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,900
Can you give us some more detail of that?

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Like, especially your experience?

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,440
Because I didn't have any ID in China,

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,610
I couldn't buy any kinds of tickets

77
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,870
for transportation on my own.

78
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,970
There are some people who

79
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,840
will help you to get to South Korea if you
pay them.

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,300
I got help from them here and there.

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,090
They bought me a ticket when I needed one.

82
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,090


83
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,420
They helped me a lot.

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,669
I had to travel to certain places to be safe
sometimes.

85
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:11,259
Sometimes they provided a taxi for me.

86
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,970
I used a lot of different ways to move around
in China.

87
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,150
And when you weren’t riding a train,

88
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,479
you were on crutches for the rest of the time,
correct?

89
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,139
That’s right, I had to use crutches all
the time,

90
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,640
and it was giving me more problems because
of it.

91
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640


92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,130
There is no one in China who uses such run-down,

93
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,270
hand-made crutches like mine.

94
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,039
Chinese people had artificial legs or nice
crutches.

95
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,850
I had no hand and tied some old wooden crutches

96
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,430
from North Korea to my arm.

97
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,430


98
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,610
A lot of people were looking at me funny.

99
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,270
Since I don't speak Chinese,

100
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,250
I was very afraid.

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,250
If any of them were to tell the Chinese police
about me,

102
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,139
I would get questioned.

103
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,099
Since I don't speak Chinese,

104
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,440
they would know I was a North Korean refugee,

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,759
and send me back to North Korea.

106
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,620
The very idea terrified me.

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,100
So, what was your process like?

108
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,570
You went from North Korea, to northeast China.

109
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,630
How did you go through China,

110
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,389
and how did you end up in South Korea?

111
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,500
I crossed the Tumen river from North Korea
and tried to move

112
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,139
to a safe place in China.

113
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:42,270
But, I encountered a lot of Chinese military
at the border,

114
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,900
and I had to hide from them for many days.

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,300
When I arrived in Yanbian,

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,080
I had to worry about the next route to travel,

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,410
and other problems I might face in the future.

118
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,210
After going through few big cities in China,

119
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,050
I finally ended up at the border of Laos.

120
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,830
I traveled through Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,

121
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,270
and finally I was able to get to South Korea.

122
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:20,039
The most dangerous country was China.

123
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,990
If they arrest any North Korean refugees,

124
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:35,940
they send them back to North Korea.

125
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,400
I was so scared, I couldn't even eat food.

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,039
I lost so much weight and became weak.

127
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,430
China was scarier than North Korea?

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,570
Yes.

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,699
Because it was bad enough to

130
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,180
escape from North Korea to begin with,

131
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,050
but If I got caught, and was sent back,

132
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:09,680
I would be in a worse situation than before
I escaped.

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
Every time I heard a sound of police cars,
sirens,

134
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,800
or even the sound of an ambulance,

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,360
my heart started pounding so hard.

136
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,860
I was so scared,

137
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,500
I couldn't hide my fear from showing.

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,180
You created the group Now Action Unity for
Human Rights

139
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,430
to help North Korean defectors.

140
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,840
What have you accomplished?

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,340
A lot of North Korean female refugees are
kidnapped

142
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,460
and sold in the Chinese countryside.

143
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,400
They are denied human rights,

144
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,920
resold over and over again,

145
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,600
and abused by their husbands.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,410
And they suffer through all this pain only
because they are from North Korea.

147
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,470
They are in a vulnerable situation because
everyone in China knows

148
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,700
if they get caught and sent back to North
Korea,

149
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,320
they will be killed.

150
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,420
I am trying to rescue these women and bring
them to South Korea.

151
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,630
A lot of women were able to come to South
Korea and find their freedom.

152
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,450
Sometimes we bring the children who were born
in China

153
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,850
and unite them with their mother.

154
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,320
Even a Chinese husband—

155
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,130
if they had a good relationship—

156
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,760
can be united with the family.

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,790
We also try to let the international society
to know

158
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,510
the terrible human rights violations happening
in North Korea.

159
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,130
We provide information through radio broadcasting

160
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,710
into North Korea to induce the change within
the society.

161
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,150
We try to educate South Koreans about

162
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,980
the terrible human rights violations in North
Korea.

163
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,630
We also try to educate people in South Korea
to prepare for democracy

164
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,940
in North Korea after the reunification of
the two Koreas.

165
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:13,090
How, specifically, do you get a North Korean
woman out of China?

166
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,880
I hope you can understand that I cannot tell
you all the details,

167
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,660
since we still use the same routes to rescue
women from China.

168
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,110
There are so many women who are still waiting
to be rescued and freed.

169
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,750
It is a fact that many North Korean refugee
women

170
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,430
are still in pain and their human rights are
violated in China.

171
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,890
Unfortunately, we can not help every woman
who contacts us for help.

172
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,530
It costs money, approximately 2000 dollars
per woman.

173
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,790
We have to give them food, clothing , transportation,

174
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,160
and sometimes shelter on their way to South
Korea.

175
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,690
We are trying to raise funds so we can rescue
more women.

176
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,710
Although there are too many requests for help
coming from all over China,

177
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,130
we have to focus on women,

178
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:12,210
whose situation is worse than others.

179
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,960
How do you feel about how President Trump
has handled North Korea?

180
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,520
I think he is doing a great job.

181
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,080
I think it’s president Trump

182
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,180
who backed North Korea into the difficult
situation it’s in right now.

183
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,710
His policy of strong sanctions forced

184
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,610
North Korea to come out from their cocoon.

185
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,800
I think time is on president Trump's side.

186
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,730
The situation in North Korea is bad.

187
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,680
It is getting worse for Kim Jong Un.

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,020
Kim Jong Un has to show

189
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,840
some positive results to North Korean people

190
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,290
such as plenty of food.

191
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,710
Instead, because of sanctions,

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,790
they have to suffer economic difficulties,

193
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,760
and they are irritated and upset now.

194
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,300
If this kind of situation lasts longer,

195
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,540
North Korean people will be unhappy with their
government

196
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,090
and be resentful toward Kim Jong Un.

197
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,560
Kim Jong Un needs to get the sanctions removed
as soon as possible,

198
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,070
and president Trump can insist on denuclearization

199
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,850
and improvement of human rights

200
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,790
while maintaining these strong sanctions on
North Korea.

201
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:27,560
I think he is doing a good job.

202
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,110
What can people around the world do to help
the people of North Korea?

203
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,260
Specifically I’m kind of interested in the
Flash Drives for Freedom.

204
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,600
People are changing in North Korea.

205
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600


206
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,770
People became more curious when the government

207
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:49,690
tried to control things and shut down influences
from outside world.

208
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,720
We are sending USB flash drives to North Korea,

209
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,730
because we believe information will change
people.

210
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,520
People in North Korea are starting to realize
that they are on a wrong path.

211
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,770
They are starting to be aware of human rights
violations in North Korea.

212
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,820
North Korean diplomats and high ranking party
officials

213
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,120
already know they are doing something wrong
because

214
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,420
they are more exposed to the outside world.

215
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,510
People inside North Korea get educated on
human rights,

216
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,950
and democracy, and individual rights by the
information

217
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,300
contained in these USB drives that we’re
sending.

218
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,260
That is why it’s very important

219
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,440
to keep sending USB drives to North Korea.

220
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,690
I believe more information will bring about

221
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,140
real change for North Korean people.

222
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,700
I understand you still carry the same crutches

223
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,670
you escaped from North Korea with.

224
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,310
Why do you do that?

225
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,240
Every time I look at my old crutches,

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,810
it reminds me of the terrible time I had to
endure in North Korea,

227
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,470
and it makes me cry.

228
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,870
However, it is a good reminder of the fact
that there are still

229
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,850
some people like me in North Korea who are
oppressed

230
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,640
by the North Korean regime.

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,120
There are so many people in North Korea who
are still suffering,

232
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,990
and the government is the cause of their pain.

233
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,010
I think of my old crutches as a symbol

234
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,390
of freedom for the people in North Korea.

235
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,480
It is a good reminder of why we have to keep

236
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,570
pointing out the human rights violations in
North Korea

237
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,360
and keep pressuring the North Korean regime
to change.

238
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,310
I will keep carrying my old crutches until
the day when North Korea

239
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,160
is changed and the people get their freedom.

240
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,380
Thank you very much for joining me today.

241
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,400
Thank you.
