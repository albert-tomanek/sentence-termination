1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,920
A professor, sentenced to life for so-called
“separatism”

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,040
Now, his daughter tells the real story of
what happened.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,160
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,891
For decades, the Chinese Communist Party

6
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:22,310
has demanded that all ethnic groups in China

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,480
assimilate to Han Chinese culture—

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,289
or more specifically,

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,820
the modern Chinese Communist Party culture

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,220
that rejects religion, tradition, and regional
languages.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,460
That’s what’s happening to the roughly
10 million Uighur people

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,360
from China’s Xinjiang Autonomous Region.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,470
Among them is professor Ilham Tohti.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,710
For years he was an economics professor in
Beijing.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,690
He also ran a website that sought to bridge
the cultural divide

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,580
between the Uighur people and Han Chinese
people.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,710
For that, he was arrested,

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,960
and he’s now serving life in prison on charges
of inciting separatism—

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,400
even though he never advocated for separatism.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,660
If you think that’s crazy,

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,990
wait till you hear what happened to his daughter.

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,940
Shelley Zhang sat down with his daughter,
Jewher Ilham,

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,289
who fled China and now lives in the US.

24
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,659
Thank you for joining us, Jewher.

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,350
It's a pleasure.

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,760
So can you tell me about the last time you
saw your father?

27
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,840
The last time I saw my father in person was
2013,

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,149
February 2nd at the Beijing international
airport.

29
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:37,240
I was accompanying my father to Indiana.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,490
My father was invited by Indiana university
as a visiting scholar

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,399
and I was just a freshman college student
and was my winter break.

32
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,890
My purpose for coming here was to just stay
for a month,

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,130
help my father settle down, maybe cook for
him

34
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,890
and then travel with him.

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,619
You weren't trying to stay here, you just
weren't going to-

36
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:57,800
I wasn't planning to stay here,

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,259
I just packed my suitcase for two weeks clothes

38
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,270
and I was planning to buy rest of the clothes
in the US

39
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,860
but at the airport my father was stopped.

40
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,939
We were actually stopped at the passport scanning
process.

41
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,939
That was the last step.

42
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,879
If my dad's passport was scanned successfully,

43
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,739
he would just get on the airplane

44
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,830
and we could have left the country together,

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,580
but he was stopped and taken away by four
to six policemen,

46
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,560
security men at the airport.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,760
I can't remember exactly because I was really
nervous

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
and shocked and didn't know what was going
on,

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
what I should do.

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,400
We were taken to a small room together

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,329
and we waited for hours and hours waiting
for someone

52
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:53,049
who is higher level to give the staff order
to let us leave.

53
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,269
But there was one staff and came in and said,

54
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,590
your father cannot go.

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,940
You can.

56
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,210
Did they say why?

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,569
They never gave us a good reason.

58
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,890
My father kept asking them, we have legal
status in China,

59
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,120
we have every document ready,

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,709
we have the invitation letter, we have visas.

61
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,659
Why aren't we allowed to leave the country?

62
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,209
I've never done anything illegal.

63
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,180
Why am I not allowed to leave?

64
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,550
But the staff just told him, if you are allowed
to go,

65
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,700
you would have gone by now.

66
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,909
Just wait, be patient.

67
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,700
And they weren't going to detain you from
leaving?

68
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,819
Yes, they...

69
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,819
In the beginning they didn't

70
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,599
even know I was my father's daughter and they
asked,

71
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,709
who are you?

72
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,459
I said, I am his daughter.

73
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,859
Where are you taking my father?

74
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,510
They said, Oh, you're his daughter,

75
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,930
then you follow us.

76
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,959
So I was taken away together.

77
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,170
They asked me if I wanted to go.

78
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,090
At that time, I did not want to leave the
country at all.

79
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,409
My only purpose for coming to US was to accompany
my father.

80
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,170
If my father was not going to make it to the
US

81
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,010
what's the point of me leaving?

82
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,010
So I refused.

83
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,010
I said no.

84
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,950
I actually said no at least five times.

85
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,019
They asked me five times, you want to go or
not?

86
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,280
Your plane is leaving.

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't say that.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,569
We are the ones who didn't allow you to leave.

89
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,480
And I said, of course I'm not leaving.

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,940
Why do you even ask?

91
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,680
For me it was an obvious question,

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,410
obvious answer, but my father looked at me
and said,

93
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,660
I think you should go.

94
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,220
Wow.

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,870
I started tearing up.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,870
Why?

97
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,870
Why and you abandoning me,

98
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,440
why are you trying to let me append you?

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,789
And he said, look around you.

100
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,570
This country is treating you like this way.

101
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,550
Do you still want to stay here?

102
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,530
I was just 18, I was a teenager

103
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,300
and I went to boarding school

104
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,940
and I lived in a bubble for my entire life.

105
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,610
For me, those kinds of things would happen
at the airport

106
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,640
that just basically didn't make sense in my
brain at all.

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,210
You weren't expecting anything like this?

108
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,210
Yes.

109
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,210
My dad kept saying,

110
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,620
Oh, we might be tailed by some Chinese government
officials.

111
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,020
I used to think my dad was just being paranoid,

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,199
suspicious all the time,

113
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,860
suspecting people all the time and when he
says stuff on them,

114
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh yeah, of course.

115
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Of course.

116
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,400
You know, annoying teenage kid, teenager.

117
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,780
At that moment, everything started making
sense

118
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,500
and then I knew my father was never lying
and all his questions,

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,740
his concerns were actually true.

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,250
I felt really ashamed

121
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,680
for at least a few years.

122
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,520
I felt ashamed for not being there for my
father,

123
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,960
not supporting him enough at that time.

124
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,110
But your father, was he trying to shield you

125
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,380
from what was happening to him?

126
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,230
Did you know that he was being surveilled
and all this stuff?

127
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,259
Whenever my father took me to shopping or
let's say going somewhere,

128
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,900
when we drive, my dad always look at the front
mirror and said,

129
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,160
okay, we're being tailed again.

130
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,300
And I used to say, do you think this is an
action movie or what?

131
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,650
Dad, you're not that important.

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,160
Nobody's going to follow you.

133
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,509
I used to say jokes to my dad like this way

134
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,220
and my dad just didn't say a word.

135
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
Sometimes...

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,870
I went to boarding school in high school

137
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,500
and when I got back home I found an empty
apartment,

138
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,639
actually many times.

139
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,400
I never really questioned the reason.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,830
I even for a while actually thought my father
left me alone

141
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,740
and went to travel by himself.

142
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,819
And even though my boarding school was very
close to my home in China,

143
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,720
but my father insisted in sending me to boarding
school.

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,660
He said, Oh, your brothers are too young.

145
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,509
They might bother your studies.

146
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,840
And then-

147
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,960
And high school is a very important time and-

148
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Yes.

149
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes.

150
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,170
So I also, I couldn't wait to leave home for
a few years.

151
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,530
I wanted to stay with my peers, with my friends
at school.

152
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,610
I was so excited for it and I was too excited
that

153
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,419
I forgot there's something wrong behind it,

154
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,840
or I just didn't want to pay attention to
it.

155
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,560
I chose to ignore it.

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,319
I don't think you should blame yourself too
much

157
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,030
because I think your father probably wanted
to keep that from you.

158
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,030
Right.

159
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,930
Yes, but I just thought if I was more supportive

160
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,190
and if I didn't argue with my dad so much,

161
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,080
if I didn't just blame him so much,

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,689
he would have less stuff on his shoulder.

163
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,800
He could have felt more relaxed.

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,509
And then he already had enough on his plate,

165
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,890
but he had to worry about me.

166
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,669
I complain about him always spending time
in front of his computers,

167
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,330
always spending time with strangers,

168
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,909
always spending time with journalists.

169
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,300
And he never spent time with me.

170
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,450
Do you what he chose to do?

171
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,530
So I kept complaining that he only focused
on his computer.

172
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,199
He actually moved his computer to my bedroom,

173
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,419
so he would type and post articles in my room
and he forgets about time.

174
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,610
We still don't talk.

175
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,610
He's in my room.

176
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,199
I'm on my bed doing my homework.

177
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,159
He's typing in front of the camera.

178
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,270
We don't talk for hours and hours and then
it's his way of,

179
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,669
okay, I am spending time with you.

180
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,010
I'm here.

181
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,349
Yes, yes.

182
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,510
He tried to find a solution.

183
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,500
It didn't work quite well,

184
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,539
but he was trying to be a good father.

185
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,310
What was your dad doing on the computer all
the time?

186
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:54,810
He created a website called Uighur biz.

187
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,110
In China, social media platforms

188
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,910
like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram

189
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,519
they're banned and search engines like Google

190
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,200
also it's banned.

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,720
And the Chinese media is obviously

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,779
censored by the Chinese government.

193
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:17,350
So there weren't enough information left

194
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,170
for the Chinese citizens to explore,

195
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,709
and not many people knew the truth

196
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:33,160
or get to have access to all this information.

197
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,890
My father believed all the misunderstanding

198
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,810
is coming from not having enough information,
knowledge.

199
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,760
Misunderstand means you didn't understand
it well,

200
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,180
that means you didn't get the correct information.

201
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,410
And if you don't have enough information,

202
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,600
how are you going to get the correct information?

203
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,920
And my father wanted to provide this platform

204
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,430
for people to create understanding,

205
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,100
gain an understanding between each other.

206
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,110
So is this specifically for Uighurs or...?

207
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,170
Not only Uighurs actually it was written

208
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,769
in many other languages as well.

209
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,770
They had different,

210
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,570
in English, Chinese, I think there was Tibetan
as well.

211
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,510
I'm not quite sure.

212
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,010
It was very long time ago and I know it was
just a teenager.

213
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,149
Anyone could post on it.

214
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,900
Han Chinese could post on it,

215
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,730
Uighurs could post on it.

216
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,450
Anyone as long as they wish to do so.

217
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,519
They could write articles, comment, like,

218
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,540
they even can have their own forum inside
the website

219
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,190
and post pictures-

220
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,370
Like a platform,

221
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,110
like a news hub,

222
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,130
all these things.

223
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,940
Yes and you could share anything.

224
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,270
And Xinjiang is so far away from mainland
China,

225
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,839
people don't get to know what is happening
with her

226
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,779
since Chinese government is not planning

227
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,310
to share information of what is going on with
there.

228
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,839
And people in Xinjiang,

229
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,410
how they are treated was directly caused by
the Chinese government

230
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,089
and they're getting those negative things.

231
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,459
For them, their stereotypes are,

232
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,430
they have made stereotypes for a Han Chinese.

233
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,100
And the Han Chinese in mainland China,

234
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,279
they have these stereotypes off Uighurs

235
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
that were given by Chinese government

236
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,580
so they don't have enough knowledge of each
other.

237
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,880
And if you have not enough knowledge of each
other,

238
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,810
you always think the other side is an evil
other side.

239
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,330
And my father was trying to prevent that from
happening.

240
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,550
My father was trying to create a bridge between
Han Chinese and Uighurs,

241
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,460
and other ethnic minorities.

242
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,940
And you know how bridges, it's connected.

243
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,410
If you're connected, you have less problems.

244
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,060
It's all about communication, right?

245
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,279
So that was your dad's website.

246
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,060
That was what he was working on?

247
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:02,230
Yes, and he spent hours, days, nights just
to post things, manage the articles.

248
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,660
And with the time pass Chinese government
realized

249
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,529
this website had gained so much attention

250
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,070
from not only inside China but also overseas.

251
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,010
My father researches the data he had collected

252
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,380
for the past few years during his researches.

253
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,670
Also those researches are not the information...

254
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,170
The Chinese government would want the overseas
people to just know-

255
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,320
He was an economist right?

256
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Your father?

257
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,290
Yes, he was an economist,

258
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,670
but he had degrees in different,

259
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,490
he studied in different fields.

260
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,120
So your father was posting dangerous information
online

261
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,470
from the perspective of the Chinese government.

262
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,880
Dangerous as the exact population of Uighurs,

263
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,170
or what's their perspective of certain policies,

264
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:59,029
dangerous information as this.

265
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,160
I guess in China's government's perspective,

266
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,990
my father was trying to brainwash everyone
that Uighurs

267
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,110
are a peaceful minority in China.

268
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,149
What a terrible thing.

269
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,149
Yes.

270
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,910
And I guess my father was trying to brainwash
people

271
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,690
that we need to make a good relationship with
each other.

272
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,660
This is the man that the Chinese government

273
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,140
imprisoned for being a separatist.

274
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Yes.

275
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,220
And he's saying we need to get along.

276
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,110
And my father never mentioned a word about

277
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,279
separating the country and he was accused
for being a separatist.

278
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,160
He had never mentioned a word about separating
the country.

279
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,329
I'll have to state that 10 times.

280
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:44,500
He had never mentioned that.

281
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,899
Let me take you back to,

282
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,350
so kind of grew up in this environment.

283
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,459
Your dad was doing this and you kind of knew

284
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,339
but not really knew what he was doing

285
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,760
and then suddenly in the Beijing airport,

286
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,070
there's this wake up call.

287
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,800
And your father is telling you to leave.

288
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,940
Did you understand that he meant leave for
America

289
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,520
and don't come back?

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,730
I think none of us knew,

291
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,990
at that time what is the next step.

292
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,120
I don't know if he was saying it to make me
go at that point

293
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,850
or he was actually thinking that way.

294
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,320
So he said, okay, just go at least and if
you don't like it,

295
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,820
come back after a month.

296
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
That's what he said.

297
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,269
He said, go check it out if you don't like
it, come back then.

298
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:33,269
That's what my dad said.

299
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,580
Then I kind of, okay,

300
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,589
maybe if I go and come back everything will
be fine.

301
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,910
But it wasn't like that.

302
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,200
When I arrived in the US I couldn't even reach
my father

303
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,260
for almost three days.

304
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,580
After three days he was released, so according
to my father,

305
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,089
he was arrested for more than 48 hours at
the airport

306
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:07,230
and he was beaten and questioned.

307
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,720
He said, no matter what I say in the future,

308
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
no matter what I tell you,

309
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,940
if I say come back, I don't mean it.

310
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
Stay there.

311
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh my God, yeah.

312
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,510
I would rather you sweep the street in the
US

313
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,709
then you coming back here.

314
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,870
How did you feel when you heard that?

315
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,180
I just cried.

316
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,180
I couldn't say a word.

317
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,709
I just cried.

318
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,410
For me, I loved my school.

319
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,760
I loved my friends.

320
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,990
I loved my classmates.

321
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,900
I loved everything that I had when...

322
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,560
I just started my freshman year and everything
was fresh,

323
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,850
brand new to me and I got along with my teammates

324
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,079
and my dance clubs and everything was going
so well.

325
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,800
And I just couldn't accept the fact

326
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,250
that I have to throw that entire life away

327
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,670
and I didn't speak English.

328
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,670
What am I going to do in the US?

329
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,880
So you didn't speak English,

330
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,750
you were by yourself in America.

331
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,730
Yeah, and I had no money.

332
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,440
I didn't know anybody.

333
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,370
For me, what am I going to do here?

334
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,040
What do you want me to do here?

335
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,819
Are you kidding me?

336
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,500
It appeared to me as something ridiculous.

337
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,580
And even though now I think back,

338
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,180
I still think it was ridiculous.

339
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,589
But that's probably the best decision

340
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,940
my father had ever made for me.

341
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,320
And I am so glad I listened to him,

342
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,690
I listened to his advice at that time.

343
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,690
So you managed to stay in the US?

344
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,870
You started going to school here?

345
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:48,019
Yeah, so I was very lucky enough, so our flight,

346
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,000
my flight was supposed to bring me and my
father,

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,430
the seat next to me was empty for the entire
14 hours.

348
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,600
I landed in Chicago because there was no direct
flight to Indianapolis.

349
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,300
So I landed in Chicago, I spoke no English.

350
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,380
I only knew a few words.

351
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,200
They asked me why your visa is J2 where's
the J1?

352
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,880
I said, my father cut, cut, gone.

353
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
And that's what I did.

354
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,890
I didn't know how to say shackled.

355
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,460
The staff at the Chicago airport apparently
thought

356
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,360
I was suspicious and said, you follow me.

357
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,330
So I was taken to another room, a small room,

358
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,200
just like the one we were locked up in China.

359
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,520
I was taken to the one in Chicago.

360
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,890
I waited there for hours and hours.

361
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,340
So more than 30 hours, no sleep, no food,
no water.

362
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,680
So I waited there and people started talking
to me.

363
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,550
I had no idea what they were saying

364
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,150
and they didn't have a Chinese translator
for me.

365
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,040
And one person, I guess she lost her patience,

366
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,500
and she said, you go back to China.

367
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,640
That I understood.

368
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,940
And I understood and I didn't know what to
do.

369
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,690
And she did this.

370
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,080
Do you have anyone to call?

371
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,260
And then I realized before I left,

372
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,660
I had a name card in my pocket.

373
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,160
I took it out.

374
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,320
I was so lucky.

375
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,760
It was the person who invited me and my father

376
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
to Indiana university.

377
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,560
It was his name card, [Elliot Burley]

378
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,570
He happened to work in the government before

379
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,820
and he called the government and they accepted
me

380
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,610
and allowed me to get into the country,

381
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,170
so that's how I'm here.

382
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:46,160
Without him I wouldn't be the person who I
am today.

383
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,230
Elliot helped me a lot and he took me under
his wing.

384
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,270
He took care of me, treated me like his own
daughter.

385
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,770
He taught me English, he was my best friend.

386
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,830
Best teacher, like a father, an uncle,

387
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,960
and he only met my father once before this
happened

388
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,930
and he sacrificed so much.

389
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,630
He passed away two years ago.

390
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,290
It was heart broken and I thought my world
was collapsing.

391
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,260
I was like, my own father is locked up in
a prison

392
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,900
and charged for sentence to life

393
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,400
and my father in the US just passed away.

394
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,430
I didn't know what to do.

395
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,570
Yeah, like bad things come one after another.

396
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,820
It was very difficult for a while.

397
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,340
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Yeah.

399
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,370
But I'm pretty sure both of them.

400
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,520
My father who's in prison,

401
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm sure he's praying for me and he's watching
over me

402
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,820
and I'm sure Elliot is also doing that too.

403
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,650
Can you contact your father at all since he
got

404
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,840
a sentence of life in prison in 2014?

405
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,230
After he was sentenced,

406
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,150
I was able to write a letter and I took a
picture of it

407
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,470
and I sent it to his lawyer.

408
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:27,120
He read it for my father and my father said,

409
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,750
tell her, let her study well.

410
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,730
That's the only thing he said.

411
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,240
That's the most parent thing you could say.

412
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,420
Yes, and that's always what he cared the most.

413
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,060
He said let her study well and take care of
her health,

414
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:51,640
and that was the last and only message I have
ever sent to my dad.

415
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,660
That was 2014 and after that I was not able
to come talk with him.

416
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:05,740
And 2017 was the last time my family members
who are in China,

417
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,500
their last time of having contact with my
father.

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,860
According to the Chinese constitutional law,

419
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,560
all political prisoners are supposed to be
allowed

420
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,920
to be visited by their family members every
month.

421
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,180
Before my family, it was every three month.

422
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,340
And since 2017 that right had been [inaudible].

423
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,850
That's around the same time that they started

424
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,030
really ramping up these concentration camps
on these days, right?

425
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,030
Yes.

426
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,770
Is your father in Xinjiang?

427
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,360
Do you know where he is imprisoned?

428
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,550
According to my last knowledge,

429
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,420
he was at Urumqi first prison,

430
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,360
but we don't know if he had been transferred

431
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,500
to another prison room or another prison

432
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,070
or to a concentration camp, I don't know anything.

433
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:05,250
And I really wish the Chinese government could
release a video or image,

434
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,810
or just simply a personal written letter from
my father

435
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,120
so I can prove that he's actually alive.

436
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,630
So tell me a little bit about the advocacy
work

437
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,930
that you're doing now for your father and
for Uighurs?

438
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,210
I understand you spoke at the UN?

439
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,210
Yes.

440
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,880
I was lucky enough to be invited

441
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:34,720
to a UN general assembly this past September.

442
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,930
I have been trying to do anything that could
possibly

443
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,950
help my father and my community.

444
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,430
I don't know if it's helping,

445
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,090
I didn't know if anything would help.

446
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:58,340
I just don't want to regret, and I don't want
to,

447
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,790
one day when I got older and I cannot face
my children

448
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,730
or cannot face my families and say, sorry,

449
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,360
I didn't do anything at that time,

450
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,170
so I'm just trying to do anything I can.

451
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,010
I don't know.

452
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,860
We try and we'll work,

453
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,100
but anything possible I will do it.

454
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,360
What do you think about what the US government
is doing?

455
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,150
They just passed the Uighur act.

456
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,480
It's a big achievement for the Uighurs

457
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,750
compared to two years ago we had nothing.

458
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,100
No attention, no acknowledge, people had no
idea who the Uighurs were.

459
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,510
Now house passed the bill,

460
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,750
we'll still need to go a Senate again

461
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,730
and then send to the president's desk,

462
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,300
but it's already a big achievement

463
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,270
and I do hope other countries can also join
the cause because one...

464
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,310
Of course the US is doing great and they have
been doing a lot of work,

465
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,830
but one country's work is not enough

466
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,840
and we need more people to join the cause

467
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,620
and that's the only way to be able to make
a change.

468
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,060
I understood you met President Trump?

469
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Yes.

470
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,170
“How long has your father been gone?”

471
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,090
“He has been in jail for five years,

472
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,850
and we don’t know how long he will still
be in there.”

473
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,660
“Do you have any communication with him?”

474
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,980
“I haven’t heard about him since 2017,

475
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,550
because that’s when the concentration camps
started.”

476
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,900
And there was also...

477
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,130
Just a few days before the oval office event,

478
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,240
it was the religious freedom ministerial event
also,

479
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
they were a few hundred government leaders

480
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
were invited and involved for their religious
freedom event.

481
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
“The Chinese government targets religion

482
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,890
to ensure that people of faith do not answer

483
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,540
to any greater power than the Chinese Communist
Party.”

484
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,200
So they seem to really be focusing on the
issue

485
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,700
of religious freedom in China and the Uighurs.

486
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:59,820
Yes, but of course it is directly connected
to religious freedom,

487
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,260
but I also want to state that it is not only
about their religion,

488
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,660
what is happening to the Uighurs is not completely
about the religion.

489
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,540
Actually I would say Chinese government

490
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:15,520
is actually using our religion to get away

491
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,960
from what they're doing to us.

492
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,180
The Islamophobia is going on around the world,

493
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,870
around the globe and when China is labeling
us,

494
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,990
when they talk about us,

495
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,470
they always label us with Islamic extremist.

496
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,000
But first of all,

497
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,420
Uighurs are Turkish minority groups

498
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,790
and we share the same language, same religion.

499
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,600
Majority of us, we believe in Islam,

500
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,650
but Uighurs are just as diverse as Americans.

501
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,600
And so I would say this is not about religion.

502
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,590
Chinese government is using religion

503
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,430
to get away from what they're treating us.

504
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,000
So to just kind of hide,

505
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,740
as a justification is what you're saying.

506
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Yes, yes.

507
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,400
And it's more about identity than religion
I would say.

508
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
It's because of we are Uighurs,

509
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,800
it's not because we're Muslims.

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,860
It's because you're a separate ethnic group
and you have your own-

511
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Yes we have different language,

512
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,990
different culture, different writing systems.

513
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,270
Even food is different.

514
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,680
How we look is different I think,

515
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,620
and of course our region is full of geopolitical
value.

516
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,670
So it could all could be the the point.

517
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,050
For an ordinary American who's looking,

518
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,780
watching this and their interest in

519
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,040
helping the situation with the Uighurs.

520
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
What can they do?

521
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,680
There are so many things.

522
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,380
They can be involved.

523
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,500
The Uighurs are still hoping the bill can
pass the Senate.

524
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,570
Well it passed the Senate,

525
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,660
but it's a different bill the house had signed,

526
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,830
there were some adjustments added so they
need to repass it.

527
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,210
And it would be great if everyone can call...

528
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,150
You don't even have to be an American citizen

529
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,780
you can call the city or the States you are
living.

530
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,970
Call your representatives.

531
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,520
Let them sign the bill as soon as possible

532
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,120
so it can be delivered to the president's
desk.

533
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,230
It might sound it's a little step but it could
help,

534
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,330
it could be a major help for Uighurs.

535
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,670
It could probably save someone's life.

536
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:41,720
Also, another thing is scholars could sign
statements

537
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,690
and they could write to red cross the organization

538
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,990
and also they could donate to different projects

539
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,960
that are supporting the Uighur cause.

540
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,760
For example, I've been working on a documentary
film over a year

541
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,800
and I have just today I have just released
a fundraising video.

542
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,350
We are wrapping up the film and we still need
some money

543
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,530
to be able to wrap up the film and it would
be great

544
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:17,230
if we can have more people join the cause
and to be involved.

545
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:23,240
So you're doing a go fund me for the documentary
you're working on?

546
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Yes.

547
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Yes.

548
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,160
The film's name is Static and Noise.

549
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,940
It will be mainly covering China's treatment
to the Uighurs in China

550
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,510
and actually not only about Uighurs.

551
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,260
It will be covering the other Christian Han
Chinese groups,

552
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,290
how they have been oppressed by the Chinese
government.

553
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,340
So it's not only about one small issue it's
about the entire issue

554
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,800
that is happening in China.

555
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,170
And also another thing I would want to state,

556
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,600
I don't hate China.

557
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,510
I don't hate Chinese people.

558
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,390
Actually a few of my best friends are actually
Chinese.

559
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,030
But I do against the Chinese government's
policy towards certain groups,

560
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,150
like the Uighurs,

561
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,470
Like the Christian minorities in China,

562
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,590
the Han Chinese group,

563
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,240
the people who are suppressed by the Chinese
government.

564
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,400
I do against that.

565
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:28,160
A lot of people would, how can I say it?

566
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
When they hear that I'm being an activist

567
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,670
or some Uighur person is being an activist

568
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,300
to help with the Uighur cause.

569
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:41,330
They think, Oh, this person is trying to do
things against China.

570
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,490
But we should separate politics.

571
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,120
This is about humanity.

572
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,460
It is a humanitarian issue and it is not about
politics.

573
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,630
It's not about religion.

574
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,450
It is about humanity and everyone should be
involved.

575
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,610
It doesn't matter if I'm Uighur,

576
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,270
if I'm Chinese, if I'm American,

577
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,220
if I'm from any other country,

578
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,340
from any other ethnicity or any other religion
group.

579
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,620
This is not about one person anymore.

580
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,750
This is about the entire...

581
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,780
Us.

582
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,810
Yeah.

583
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,420
Well, thank you so much for joining us today.

584
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,660
Thank you so much.
