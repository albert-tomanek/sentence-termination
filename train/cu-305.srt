00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,689
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:04,209
5 hotspots for war with China.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,660
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,200
War.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,660
It’s like punching your boss at work.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,710
Fun to think about,

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,039
but inadvisable to actually do.

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,579
That’s why China has always been a “defender
of peace.”

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,219
I mean, China even started the China World
Peace Foundation.

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,940
...sponsored in part by North Korea.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,899
Wow. Look at this art exhibition in Peace
Garden.

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,219
Guarded by a totally peaceful armed soldier.

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,429
But not all of China’s neighbors are peaceful
and friendly allies.

14
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:54,629
In fact, a number of countries are not content

15
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,030
with doing whatever the Chinese Communist
Party wants.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,940
Could war be on the horizon?

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,949
Here are 5 places where it’s most likely
to start.

18
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,520
Number 5 Arunachal Pradesh

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,110
You might not have ever heard of this place.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,719
Just like you might never have heard about

21
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,299
the four-week war India and China fought in
1962.

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,640
But it has to do with this area,

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
near the border between India and Tibet.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,140
It’s controlled by India.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,950
But the Chinese regime claims the territory
as its own.

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,219
This will be a frequent theme in this episode.

27
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,799
In the 1962 war,

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,590
China seized part of Arunachal Pradesh.

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,700
But after a ceasefire was declared,

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,420
Chinese troops retreated back to the old border
lines.

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,329
These days it’s kind of like the American
Civil War

32
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,109
in that people love to reenact it for some
reason I’m not entirely clear on.

33
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,429
But in this case, they don’t have a picnic
afterwards.

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,360
According to the Times of India,

35
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,659
Chinese troops advance into Arunachal Pradesh

36
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,170
before ultimately retreating about “twice
a year.”

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,899
Their last scheduled temporary invasion was
just a few weeks ago.

38
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,420
But ultimately, it’s not really a territory
worth fighting over.

39
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,280
Very few Chinese people live there,

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,390
and it’s so high up in the Himalayan mountains

41
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,380
that it’s not the most ideal environment
for long-term occupation.

42
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,360
Maybe that’s why China prefers to send nuclear
submarines into the Indian Ocean

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,790
and buddy up with India’s nuclear-armed
rival, Pakistan.

44
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,820
Number 4 The South China Sea

45
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,730
This lovely spot of ocean is home to rich
reserves of natural gas, oil, fishing

46
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,780
and about 5 trillion dollars worth of annual
trade and shipping.

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,910
And like the One Ring, everyone wants it.

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,270
And their claims overlap.

49
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,900
But of all the countries involved,

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,480
China has been the most aggressive in asserting
its claims.

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,080
China’s built artificial islands in disputed
waters and put military bases on them.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
"So that Island we talked about,

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
it was a reef, Fiery Cross, in 2006.

54
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Look at it a couple of years later.

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,940
You get a sense of the scale of the construction here."

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,720
They’ve also built oil platforms.

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,320
And Chinese ships have rammed other countries’
boats.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,540
And while most of these conflicts could be
resolved by simple international arbitration,

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,020
using, you know, international law,

60
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,410
the Chinese regime has resisted that at every
opportunity.

61
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,830
Now, add to that US presence in the region

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,450
and you have a dangerous, tense situation
that could spiral out of anyone’s control.

63
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,000
just like a game of Twister.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,970
Only with nukes.

65
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,260
Number 3 The East China Sea

66
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,340
You know what this has in common with the
South China Sea?

67
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,310
They both have China in the name,

68
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,660
so clearly they belong to China!

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,710
That logic does not apply to say, the Indian
Ocean, mind you.

70
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,990
The East China Sea separates China and Japan

71
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,400
two countries that have historically not gotten
along at all.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,590
And the current trouble centers around these
islands,

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,640
known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,670
According to a post World War II treaty,

75
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,210
they belong to Japan.

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,230
But the Chinese regime considers that Sen-kaka.

77
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,250
They say it’s Chinese territory, and they
call it the Diaoyu Islands.

78
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,790
Mind you, they’re uninhabited rocks.

79
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,530
But they sit on oil reserves.

80
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,040
Tensions have heated up since 2012

81
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,930
when Japan nationalized the archipelago.

82
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,240
Since then China has sent many ships sailing
in or around

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,940
the waters surrounding the islands.

84
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,080
Chinese activists have even landed on some
of the islands carrying flags.

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,470
Yeah, Taiwan also has a claim.

86
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,690
Which is cool with China

87
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,400
because China also claims Taiwan.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,010
In response, a few days later,

89
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,010
Japanese activists did the same thing.

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,630
Then in 2013,

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,150
China established an Air Defense Zone over
the islands.

92
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,370
It required that every aircraft entering

93
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,730
must identify itself to Chinese patrols, or
else.

94
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,500
The US and Japan have pretty much decided
to ignore it.

95
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,180
So the Chinese regime keeps pushing the envelope

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,110
like a passive-aggressive postal worker.

97
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,150
For example, sending navy ships really close
to,

98
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,880
but not technically within,

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,090
Japan’s territorial waters.

100
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,670
The tensions between China and Japan have
gotten so bad,

101
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,880
the conflict has been called,

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,410
“the most dangerous standoff since the Cuban
Missile Crisis.”

103
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,440
Number 2 Taiwan

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,170
Taiwan has been an independent,

105
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,540
umm…

106
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,550
not country, since 1949.

107
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,100
The island is governed independently,

108
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,920
but the mainland Chinese government has said

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,310
it will use force to take Taiwan back

110
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,970
if it ever formally declares independence.

111
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,840
And just to be prepared,

112
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,620
China has about 1,600 missiles aimed at it.

113
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,750
The relationship between both sides has its
ups and down.

114
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,150
For instance, the last President of Taiwan,
Ma Ying-jeou,

115
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,460
did a lot to smooth out relations.

116
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,740
He opened up Taiwan to mainland business and
tourism.

117
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,080
He was even the first leader of Taiwan to
meet with the leader of China.

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,610
And yet still, you see this

119
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,650
that’s footage of China’s army doing a
drill

120
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,860
where they take over Taiwan’s presidential
palace.

121
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,780
And now, Taiwan has a new president, Tsai
Ing-wen.

122
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,340
She wants Taiwan to cut economic reliance
on mainland China.

123
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,960
And in her inaugural speech,

124
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
even didn’t mention that China and Taiwan
were the same country.

125
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,830
Awkward…

126
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,930
And Number 1 North Korea

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,380
Don’t worry, North Korea and China are still
friends.

128
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,870
But North Korea itself could still become
a flashpoint for war involving China.

129
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,669
As long as North Korea stays peaceful in its
Peace Garden,

130
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,560
everything will be fine

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,980
for the people who don’t live there anyway.

132
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,080
But North Korean leader Kim Jung-un might
not want peace.

133
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,340
Recently, state media there aired this video,

134
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,000
promising to turn South Korea’s capital
into a “sea of flames.”

135
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,020
Wow, nice CGI.

136
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,310
And if North Korea really re-starts its war
with South Korea,

137
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,199
well, South Korea will fight back.

138
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,639
And its buddy the USA will come to its aid.

139
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,160
And that would put China in a tough spot.

140
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,490
Will they fight alongside North Korea,

141
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,610
like they did during the 1950s?

142
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,970
Or will they stand by and watch the US and
South Korea beat North Korea to a pulp?

143
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,680
But that would mean US and South Korean troops

144
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,729
would soon be stationed right along the Chinese
border.

145
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,639
So the Chinese regime is stuck trying to maintain
a dangerous, unstable status quo.

146
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,660
So what do you think about the 5 hotspots
for war?
