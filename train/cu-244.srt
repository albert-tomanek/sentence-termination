1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,060
This is The People’s Tribunal.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,089
These are the plaintiffs.

3
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,280
David Kilgour, a Canadian lawyer and politician.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,200
And Ethan Gutmann, an investigative journalist

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,530
who’s been researching China for two decades.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,409
They accuse the Chinese Communist Party

7
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,740
of orchestrating a massive underground

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,589
organ transplant network

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,930
using the bodies of innocent people.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,949
And these are the defendants.

11
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:26,310
Ahem.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,199
These are the defendants.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,780
Um...are they not gonna show?

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,480
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,760
According to Chinese state-run media,

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,449
the World Health Organization is asking China

18
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:44,780
to advise health authorities worldwide

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,090
on best practices in organ transplants.

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,760
That’s great news.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,629
Because China has so much experience!

22
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,920
They carry out more organ transplants

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,390
than any other country, after the US.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,510
At least, according their official numbers.

25
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,339
Which are pretty amazing for a country

26
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,550
that didn’t even have an organ donation
system

27
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,980
until a few years ago.

28
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,270
I guess that’s why “The National Health
Commission

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,740
said [China’s] practices and experiences

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,070
are now recognized by the world’s

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,690
mainstream medical community.”

32
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,240
But weirdly, there seem to be mixed messages

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,260
from the world community.

34
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,840
Because on one hand,

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,820
Chinese doctors are working with the WHO

36
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,350
to advise the global medical community.

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,530
But on the other hand,

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,440
China is also allegedly leading the world

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,700
in forced organ harvesting.

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,300
By allegedly carrying out over

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,520
60,000 illegal organ transplants every year.

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,200
That’s more than triple the official transplant
numbers.

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,450
And they allegedly take those extra organs

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,090
from Chinese prisoners of conscience.

45
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,240
These are not people who are on death row

46
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,000
for committing actual crimes.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,670
These are innocent people who happen to belong
to

48
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,110
groups that the Chinese Communist Party persecutes.

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,490
Groups like Falun Gong,

50
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,460
Uighurs, Tibetans, and Christians.

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,030
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party

52
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,429
denies it completely.

53
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,489
According to the Chinese embassy,

54
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,900
“The so-called organ harvesting...

55
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,859
is totally a lie fabricated by Falun Gong.”

56
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:21,340
You know how those persecuted spiritual groups
can get!

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,500
So the Chinese Communist Party

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,060
sends them to labor camps

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,890
and tortures them a little,

60
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,739
and maybe a few..hundred thousand...die.

61
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,379
Accidentally, of course.

62
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,000
And suddenly people are accusing

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,629
the Party of taking their organs.

64
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,549
I mean, who would believe them?

65
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,019
Other than independent researchers

66
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,780
and medical experts from around the world.

67
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,660
So how we determine who’s telling the truth?

68
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,019
What are people going to do,

69
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,879
look at the actual evidence and prove it in
court?

70
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,799
Yes, yes, that’s exactly what people are
doing.

71
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,099
This is the “Independent Tribunal into Forced
Organ Harvesting

72
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,310
from Prisoners of Conscience in China.”

73
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,010
It’s an “An independent people’s tribunal...

74
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,920
established to inquire into forced organ harvesting
from,

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,230
amongst others,

76
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,360
prisoners of conscience in China.”

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,030
That sounds pretty serious.

78
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,330
Now, the tribunal didn’t get a lot of attention

79
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,379
from the mainstream media,

80
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,310
but in this era of infotainment news,

81
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,719
I think it’s just a branding issue.

82
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,939
I would have called it

83
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,030
the “Independent Tribunal into One Weird
Trick

84
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,109
Chinese Hospitals Use to Make Money

85
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,939
and Help You Lose Weight.

86
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,650
The Results Will Shock You.”

87
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,889
But that’s just me.

88
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,769
Anyway, this tribunal means business.

89
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,260
Leading the Tribunal is Sir Geoffrey Nice.

90
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,180
He led the prosecution of Serbian dictator
Slobodan Milošević

91
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,550
for war crimes at the UN’s International
Criminal Tribunal

92
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,560
for the Former Yugoslavia.

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,340
And now, Sir Nice is looking into allegations

94
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,170
of state-sponsored slaughter in China.

95
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,739
“This tribunal, it will be recalled,

96
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,590
is investigating if criminal offenses

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,549
have been committed by state or state approved
bodies

98
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,389
or organizations or individuals in China,

99
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,609
that or who may have

100
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,680
engaged in forced organ harvesting.”

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,450
That’s from the first part of the Tribunal
last December.

102
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,129
And this past April 6 and 7,

103
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,700
he held part 2.

104
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I would have called it

105
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,760
“Independent Tribunal Part 2: Electric Boogaloo.”

106
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,260
I don’t know why they don’t consult with
me on branding.

107
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,200
Anyway, the thing lasted two entire days,

108
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,220
so I’ll just give you the highlights in
5 minutes.

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,950
Organ transplant researcher Ethan Gutmann

110
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,100
is the author of “The Slaughter:

111
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,860
Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting,

112
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,070
and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident
Problem”.

113
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,980
He concluded that the Chinese regime

114
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,270
is murdering dissidents on a massive scale,

115
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,640
and forcibly extracting their organs for profit.

116
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Spoiler alert.

117
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,560
That’s the secret solution to China’s
dissident problem.

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,790
For about 20 years,

119
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,280
the main source of these organs

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,160
have been people who practice Falun Gong.

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
You see, Chinese authorities claimed

122
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,330
doing these kinds of exercises is dangerous
and illegal,

123
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,630
so people who do them need to be “re-educated”.

124
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,340
In labor camps.

125
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,910
Without trial.

126
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,220
Then rich people who want new organs

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,280
can visit state-run Chinese hospitals

128
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,150
and schedule an organ transplant,

129
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,420
and these Falun Gong practitioners would be...

130
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,440
what’s a nice euphemism?...

131
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,700
required to donate their organs right away.

132
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,880
And now that the Chinese regime

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,100
has launched a new wave of persecution

134
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,730
against the Uighur people who live in Xinjiang,

135
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,680
Gutmann says they’re also being

136
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
targeted for “organ donation.”

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,150
“Because of the Uighur situation—

138
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,110
it is as if we’re seeing a speeded up version

139
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,070
of the Falun Gong persecution.

140
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,820
It’s just sort of happening at five times
the speed.”

141
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,020
Which is to say,

142
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,000
experience really is the best teacher.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,120
You start with small scale human experiments

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,260
on a group no one really cares about,

145
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,870
and then when you see results,

146
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,160
you ramp it up on another group

147
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,870
no one really cares about.

148
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,110
You already built the system,

149
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,290
so now it’s faster and more efficient.

150
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,150
And joining the Tribunal by phone

151
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,620
was former Canadian MP David Kilgour.

152
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,170
He co-authored a book called Bloody Harvest.

153
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,170
And, look,

154
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,480
I know you’re not going to read the book.

155
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,070
So I’ll just tell you,

156
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,080
it lays out like 30 points of evidence

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,240
that Chinese authorities are killing people
for their organs.

158
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,060
It’s pretty solid.

159
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,400
Kilgour joined last weekend’s Tribunal by
phone

160
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,390
to give his testimony.

161
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,480
And he was asked why—

162
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,830
if it’s all true—

163
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,320
is there so little action

164
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,540
by other governments around the world?

165
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,420
“It’s a sad thing to say

166
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,270
but I’m absolutely convinced it’s wilful
ignorance.

167
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,200
It’s choosing not to say anything.”

168
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Witnesses at the tribunal, though,

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,850
said a lot about the atrocities they experienced.

170
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,991
Like this woman who was persecuted in China

171
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,350
because she practices Falun Gong.

172
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,250
She said after she was arrested,

173
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,430
doctors collected samples of her blood.

174
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,850
“I looked and saw how much blood was extracted.

175
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,850
And it was the first time

176
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,210
that I had seen this [so much blood].

177
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,410
It was very distressing.”

178
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,970
Experts on forced organ harvesting say

179
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,150
taking blood from political prisoners is common,

180
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,550
and a great way to screen potential donors.

181
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,200
She was probably lucky to escape.

182
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,650
And then there’s this woman on the screen,

183
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,370
Mihrigul Tursun.

184
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,140
She was imprisoned in China for being a Uighur.

185
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
She joined by video,

186
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,660
through a translator.

187
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,410
“They separated me from my babies,

188
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,050
and after three hours interrogation

189
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,051
they sealed my mouth

190
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,800
and put a black hood over my head,

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,300
handcuffed me and took me to a detention center.”

192
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,920
She said her three children

193
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,550
were also taken into custody.

194
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,720
One of them died,

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,030
and the other two came back

196
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,360
with scars from being operated on.

197
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,430
Now these are pretty serious allegations.

198
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,270
So you’d think it’s only fair that the
tribunal

199
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,930
would give Chinese officials

200
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,180
the chance to present their case.

201
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,770
Well, they did.

202
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,860
Representatives of the Chinese Embassy

203
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,890
were invited to counter the allegations.

204
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,740
“Good morning everyone,

205
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,840
is anybody representing the People’s Republic
of China

206
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
present in this room?”

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
“No Sir.”

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,170
Huh.

209
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,340
I wonder why the Chinese officials didn’t
show.

210
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,890
Maybe they were just too busy

211
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,490
advising the World Health Organization.

212
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,340
But in the interest of being impartial and
objective,

213
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,250
the tribunal invited anyone to provide evidence

214
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,229
that disproves the allegation that the Chinese
regime

215
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,829
is slaughtering innocent people for their
organs.

216
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:40,669
“Our determination as a tribunal is to remain

217
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,269
completely open to evidence of whatever inclination,

218
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,449
persuasion, whatever you like,

219
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,560
right until the last moment.

220
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,100
And we hope that anyone who has

221
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,439
or can point to evidence that will help the
tribunal

222
00:08:55,439 --> 00:09:00,110
will come forth and make that evidence available.”

223
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,620
But so far, the evidence has been overwhelmingly

224
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,430
the kind that Chinese officials fear.

225
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,519
So much so that although the Tribunal

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,550
won’t end until June,

227
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,350
they issued a rare interim judgement back
in December.

228
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,009
“We the tribunal members are all certain,

229
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,269
unanimously and sure beyond reasonable doubt—

230
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,350
that in China forced organ harvesting

231
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,610
from prisoners of conscience

232
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,870
has been practiced for a substantial period
of time

233
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,220
involving a very substantial number of victims.”

234
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,430
So the interim judgement is that organ harvesting

235
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,600
is definitely happening.

236
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,829
The tribunal will eventually issue a final
judgement

237
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,759
that includes whether Chinese authorities

238
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,290
have broken international law.

239
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,290
But it’s still unclear

240
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,960
whether governments around the world

241
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,180
will listen to what the tribunal has to say.

242
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,209
So what do you think of the “Independent
Tribunal

243
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,560
into Forced Organ Harvesting

244
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,670
from Prisoners of Conscience in China?

245
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,560
Did the results shock you?

246
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,420
Leave your comments below.

247
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,490
And now it’s time for me to answer

248
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,790
a question from one of you—

249
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,899
a fan who supports China Uncensored

250
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,630
with a dollar or more per episode,

251
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,449
by contributing through our Patreon website.

252
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,939
Daniel Ortman asks:

253
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:18,680
“I'm curious about the PRC's relationship

254
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,899
with its former USSR neighbors.

255
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,899
Kazakhstan I know has ethnic

256
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,980
and cultural ties to the Uyghurs,

257
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,160
so I would imagine that they have

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,180
had arguments over the issue.

259
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,639
Or does China just push them around?”

260
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,120
Good question, Daniel.

261
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,290
So as you know,

262
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,470
Kazakhstan is a country that borders

263
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,080
both China and Russia.

264
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,920
“This is my country of Kazakhstan.”

265
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Unfortunately,

266
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,269
Kazakhstan will ALWAYS be known for Borat—

267
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,790
a caricature played by a comedian from London.

268
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,370
What was your question?

269
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,769
Oh right.

270
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:49,769
Kazakhstan and the Uighurs.

271
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,439
Yeah, so Kazakhstan does have

272
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:52,920
a cultural connection to the Uighurs

273
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,779
who live in Western China.

274
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,899
But more importantly,

275
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,620
Kazakhstan is a big part of China’s

276
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,959
Belt and Road Initiative.

277
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,230
Kazakhstan has become the main hub

278
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,569
between China and Europe for all the goods

279
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,580
that are transported by train.

280
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,029
And Kazakhstan is not exactly a rich country.

281
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,009
So it’s understandable that Kazak leaders

282
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,260
want Chinese investment—

283
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,370
because the alternative is no investment.

284
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,399
But the catch is,

285
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,809
they have to keep their mouths shut

286
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,519
about the Uighurs being tortured

287
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,460
or even killed for their organs in China.

288
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,930
And there’s now growing evidence

289
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,149
that ethnic Kazakhs are also being arrested
in China.

290
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,149
On the plus side,

291
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,540
for the Chinese regime,

292
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,819
this relationship is a win-win.

293
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,480
Like when Kazakhstan authorities arrested

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,100
a human rights activist who helped expose

295
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,589
the reeducation camps in Xinjiang.

296
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,949
Uh, totally not because the Chinese Communist
Party

297
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,930
asked them to.

298
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,560
Thanks for your question, Daniel.

299
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,970
And thanks to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

300
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,350
who support China Uncensored.

301
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,259
It’s only because of your support

302
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,850
that we’ve been able to cover topics like
this,

303
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,830
that most other media don’t want to.

304
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,610
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

305
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,620
See you next time.
