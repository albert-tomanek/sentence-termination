00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,400
This is the Technical Difficulties, we’re
playing ‘Citation Needed.’

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,270
Joining me today, he reads books y’know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,130
“Hello, I’m Chris Joel,
Christ College Oxford,

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,660
reading references to surfing in the early
King James Bible.”

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,940
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,170
So, the vicar, with a sickly smile,
shook hands with the monkey

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,840
and could never look a banana
in the face again.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,400
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,119
Hello, live studio audience!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
In front of me I’ve got an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can’t see it.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,960
Every fact they get right is
a point and a ding,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,400
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is:

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,949
And today we are talking about Jack Churchill.

14
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,269
Is this the method by which one would raise
a wartime prime minister?

15
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,020
I’m glad that’s the version of the verb
you went with there, Gary,

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,891
that could’ve been a lot worse.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,360
I'll be honest, it was the flip of a coin
and I went with the clean one.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,920
The thought of Churchill being raised
ever so slightly.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,789
“Yes, you may check my undercarriage for
wear and tear.”

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,280
No, it’s for when he needs to seem more
authoritative.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,890
“Oh s***, he’s a lot shorter than Stalin!”

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,980
“We shall fight them on the beaches.”

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,100
“In the fields.
And in the street.”

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,440
- “Enough!”
- “And in the treetops.”

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,520
I just like the idea that
Churchill is now just sat

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,490
about 6ft above everyone else in a chair that
he can’t possibly get down from.

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,570
At which point there’s a beeping noise and
Stalin comes in on a cherry picker.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,780
It explicitly says, at the end of this article,

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,220
“Of no relation to Winston Churchill.”

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,590
Well, there you go, that’s our first five
minutes completely redundant.

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,120
Is it that nutter who tried to fight
World War 2 with a claymore?

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,220
Episode over.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,540
Sorry guys.

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,220
Goodnight, thank you very much for coming...

35
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:50,340
You say episode over, but there is a heck
of a lot more to this story going on here.

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,689
A claymore is a proximity triggered-

37
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:55,979
No, it’s a hand-and-a-half Scottish sword.

38
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:56,979
Oh, a sword?

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
- Yes.
- Oh.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,160
I mean, a claymore is a mine as well, but
this is-

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,590
Okay, a different type of claymore.

42
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,369
Yes, as in “Scottish Clans-man!”

43
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:08,119
“I will see off the entire continent”
and that was basically his remit.

44
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,720
That was what he went into the war to do.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Wow.

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,020
Where do you think he was born?

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Not Scotland.

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,400
Not Scotland, you’re absolutely right, he
was born in Ceylon.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
Okay, Sri Lanka.

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,060
Actually, you say drafted, he joined of his
own accord in the 1920s.

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,670
Mainly because there weren’t enough things
to cut up in Ceylon!

52
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,550
Well, yes, he left the army in 1936.

53
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,760
Because there was not enough fighting.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,830
He then worked as a few other things.

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,080
What might that be?

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,300
One is a phrase I wouldn’t associate with
the 1930s,

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,210
of a job for a... a strapping young lad.

58
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,210
- Chef.

59
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,210
- IT technician.

60
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,210
I was going to say…

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,380
Operative of a mildly successful nail bar.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,840
“A little bit off the top? Right!”
"Whoa!"

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Male model.

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,980
- Really?
- I can see that.

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,020
He also used his archery and bagpipe talents

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,510
to play a role in a film called
‘The Thief of Baghdad.’

67
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,080
- Eh?
- With bagpipes?

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,580
With bagpipes.

69
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,020
‘The Bagpipes of Baghdad’?

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,140
Was it really ‘The Thief of Bagpipes’?

71
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,900
He won second place in the military piping
competition at Aldershot Tattoo.

72
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
- But that was cake-making...
- Was that like cakes?

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Jinx!

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,080
Are you going to ice a cake with bagpipes?

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Yes, you can do five bits at a time if you
blow hard enough.

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,590
He also represented Britain at the
World Archery Championships.

77
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,590
With the sword?

78
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,570
Where he also used the bagpipes.

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,680
No, this was a longbow.

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,370
Of course, it would be.

81
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,230
The Second World War breaks out…

82
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,380
And he decides not to bring the longbow because
it’s impractical.

83
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Wrong.

84
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Really?

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,520
He brought the longbow?

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,760
“Hi, can I help?

87
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,540
I’ve got one of these!”

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,800
He really was going to party like it was 1399
wasn’t he?

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,420
He was with the Manchester Regiment in France
and ambushed a German patrol.

90
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,860
How did he give the signal to attack?

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,410
Did he just scream and run?

92
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,710
Not this time.

93
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,930
I’m going to give you the point
because, yes,

94
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,900
he did that plenty of other times but not
this specific time.

95
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,990
He was in command of the troops,

96
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,640
how did he give the signal to attack?

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,740
Did he have his bagpipes with him?

98
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,220
A quick parp on the high notes, yeah.

99
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,780
With the drone beneath.

100
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,389
That’s not the skill he used here.

101
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,389
Flaming arrows!

102
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:21,709
I’m going to give you the point,

103
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,159
he killed an enemy sergeant with the longbow.

104
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,979
Oh boy!

105
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,470
Not with the arrow, with the bow.

106
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,030
Yeah, with the stringy bit first.

107
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,680
Like cheese wire.

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,990
To use the technical term,
"the stringy bit of the bow".

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,940
The last recorded person ever killed during
wartime with a longbow and arrow

110
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,229
was that German sergeant.

111
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,759
Now, I’ve just noticed something,

112
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,490
this man seemed to have a penchant...
is that the word?

113
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,710
For running into battle and screaming.

114
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,259
He managed to go into several battles…

115
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,650
Many battles.

116
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,650
Without dying?

117
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,650
Yes.

118
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,980
Yeah, but with the longbow you are quite a
way back.

119
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,520
Norway, 1941, landing craft on a raid on a
German garrison.

120
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,289
I mean, paint me a picture.

121
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,289
What…?

122
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,960
I’m thinking night-time, I imagine.

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,330
Now, you see,

124
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,060
it’s the point of when he starts playing
the bagpipes.

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,530
“Franz, vat is zat coming from over ze ocean?”

126
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,349
Sorry, worst accent in the world there.

127
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,740
And the wheel spins and lands on Norway!

128
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,530
Would that be the Boulogne part of Norway
you’re doing there?

129
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,770
Yes, it’s the German garrison out of France...

130
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,850
Fair play.

131
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,850
Would you do it over the ocean

132
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,169
or would you wait until the landing craft
had silently approached the beach

133
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,979
with the whistle of the wind through the trees

134
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,320
as the clank of the metal as it hits the beach,
suddenly…

135
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,999
You’re nearly right.

136
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:44,620
Yes, he leapt forward from his position, 
playing on his bagpipes,

137
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,729
before throwing a grenade
and running into battle.

138
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,439
This man is a hero!

139
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,419
Oh, if you’re going to do anything.

140
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,970
Just the thought, just to be inside his head

141
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,629
as he approached the beach with the bagpipe
ready to go

142
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,560
and the grenade pin in his hand thinking,

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,330
“Yeah, we’re going to do this.”

144
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,330
Again!

145
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,379
“This is my time”, for the fifteenth time.

146
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,520
If that was me I’d pull the pin,
drop the bagpipe,

147
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,159
and then there'd just be a parpy explosion.

148
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,479
You say he threw a grenade, did it hit anything
or did he throw it by mistake?

149
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,569
It’s not recorded here, I don’t know.

150
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,120
What a hero.

151
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,040
So we’ve had France, 1940, Norway, 1941,
where was he in 1943?

152
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,860
Italy.

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,880
Correct.

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
He’s got some good airmiles hasn’t he?

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Did they drop him in?

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,499
Not sure you get airmiles
on the army’s flights.

157
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,199
I’ve seen a video of a bagpiper in a parachute.

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,199
It was…

159
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
That was so close.

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
I’m going to drink that later, go on…

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,139
It was in the ’70s.

162
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,900
Basically the ‘One Show’ of the ’70s,
‘Nationwide’, did a segment,

163
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,080
and I don’t know why because I’ve only
seen the clip itself.

164
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,210
There’s a bagpiper, a low altitude plane,

165
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,060
he’s got the parachute on one of those cords
that triggers it-

166
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Static lines.

167
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,770
Jumps out, starts playing ‘Scotland the
Brave’ on the way down.

168
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,889
It’s great because he gets in, he gets the
drone on...

169
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:56,889
♪ Na na na-na na na na ♪

170
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:57,889
But then it hits the ground.

171
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,309
And he cannot do a landing and hold onto the
bagpipes at the same time.

172
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:04,809
No he can't, you’ve got to flare, you’ve
got to pull down both straps and…

173
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,909
If that’s the technical term, so be it.

174
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,610
But all I heard was
♪ na na-na urrrk urrrrrrk ♪

175
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,539
as he got dragged along
by the wind on the floor,

176
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,759
the mournful parp of an emptying bagpipe.

177
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,449
A mournful parp of a bagpipe!

178
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,159
This, sadly, was not a parachute.

179
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,639
This was a landing site.

180
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,900
Was this, again, the same as Norway,
yet slightly sunnier?

181
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,460
This was the same as Norway,
yet slightly more.

182
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
Ohh…

183
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,909
What hasn’t he used?

184
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,180
Whoa, he has his bow as well?

185
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,580
Yes, he had the broadsword, the longbow and
the bagpipes.

186
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,960
And the grenade?

187
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,599
It doesn’t say.

188
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,330
He’s like the people
you get in computer games.

189
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,640
“It’s funny because you could never carry
all of these!

190
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,320
“How is he carrying all of these?

191
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,780
“Where did he get that from?

192
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,420
“He was holding a sword a minute ago!”

193
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,480
And playing the bagpipes which, again,

194
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,580
is a two-handed instrument, let’s not forget.

195
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,420
How fantastic would it be if he just had a
batman though?

196
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,749
Going back another 50 years where you’d
just have a gentleman’s gentleman with you

197
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,880
and just take him on the battlefield,

198
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,979
“Broadsword if you would, Jeeves.”

199
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:08,979
“Yes, Sir.”

200
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,480
“He’s a little way off. Longbow. Thank you.

201
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,039
“No, nothing’s happening.

202
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,210
“Bagpipes, we’ll sound some more.”

203
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,380
“Number three wood for the grenade.”

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
“Might I suggest the pitching wedge, Sir,
they’re awfully dug in.”

205
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,260
Oh, I was thinking more cricket bat.

206
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,860
Pitch her up. Thock!

207
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,889
Going full zombie into battle!

208
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,080
I seem to recall someone saying that the effective
range of a grenade

209
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,820
is further than you can throw it.

210
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,370
Right, so you do need something like a bat
behind it then?

211
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,780
Or you need to chuck it into somewhere and
move out.

212
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,080
- You’re chucking it, I’m running away.
- I’ve got the bagpipes.

213
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,380
Do you want to bat a grenade?

214
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,200
Yes, I reckon I would.

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,530
“Oh... wait, no!”

216
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,820
Extra second on the detonator just for the
pitch up.

217
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,720
If you miss it you’re in trouble.

218
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,650
Look, I didn’t say this wasn’t one for
the courageous soldier did I?

219
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,430
He infiltrated the town…

220
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,430
Playing the bagpipes.

221
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,690
Not they, he.

222
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,940
Hang on, infiltration and this man don’t
sound like words that go together.

223
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,970
He was ordered to capture a
German observation post.

224
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,410
How did that go?

225
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,690
Er, surprisingly well?

226
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes, I’ll give you the point, he captured
42 prisoners.

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
F***!

228
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,620
No one tried to shoot the bagpipes?

229
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,390
I’d be honest, it’s not the first thing
you’d- well, I don’t know.

230
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,330
It depends how anti-bagpipe you are.

231
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,300
If I was there that would be
the first thing I’d go for.

232
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,631
You’ve got three bullets, what do you shoot?

233
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,580
The bagpipes three times.

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
I can just see the bullet going through and,

235
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,820
“Ye shot my pipes.
Now I’m angry!”

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
He wasn’t Scottish!

237
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,290
I’m going to point this out.

238
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,300
He wasn’t Scottish.

239
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,320
Yeah, but they wouldn’t know that.

240
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,500
He was captured-

241
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,940
Yes.

242
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Was he?

243
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Do you know the story there?

244
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,840
I can only presume that he was captured, 
went along willingly,

245
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,570
beat all the guards at chess and poker,

246
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,690
drank the camp commandant's rum,

247
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,820
then dug his way out with his teeth while
the commandant was passed out,

248
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,040
chewing on broken glass
and spitting it at guards

249
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,370
before having relations with the entire
female population of the nearest town,

250
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,070
lighting a cigarette on the ground,
not even using a match,

251
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,230
flipping the V and then walking into camp
and saying,

252
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,520
“What have you f***ers been doing?”

253
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Tom…

254
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,970
Just as a guess(!)

255
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,240
Tom, please ding,
for the love of God please ding.

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,420
It’s not even close but I’m going to give
him a point for it.

257
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,760
Crawled under the wire,
through an abandoned drain

258
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,130
and tried to walk to the Baltic coast.

259
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,620
Ended up being recaptured, escaped again,

260
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,150
walked 93 miles to Verona in Italy and met
the Americans there.

261
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,240
I bet they were delighted to see him(!)

262
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,480
Then continued and went to Burma.

263
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
Arriving in 1957.

264
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,960
By the time he’d got there what had happened?

265
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Was the war over?

266
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Yes, absolutely right.

267
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Oh.

268
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,620
That must’ve been very
disappointing for him.

269
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,460
I’m going to quote here, “If it wasn’t
for those damn Yanks,

270
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,220
“we could’ve kept the war going
another 10 years.”

271
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,510
See what you did!

272
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,280
You ruined that man’s 1940s.

273
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,780
Wow, that is an insight
into his mind isn’t it?

274
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Yes.

275
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,580
Hang on a minute,
I want to ask you a genuine question,

276
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,510
what the frig did he do after the war?

277
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,490
Because he is tooled up and angry.

278
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,940
Him on the checkout in Sainsbury’s!

279
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,320
No, he walked back from Burma to Korea.

280
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,690
When that was over he walked to Vietnam.

281
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,850
The answer is, and I’m giving you
a retroactive point here Gary…

282
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,850
Oh, respective pointage!

283
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,480
Because you’ve already said the word,

284
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,050
what did he qualify as in the army?

285
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Supermarket...?

286
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,220
I can’t remember what I said!

287
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,020
“You are now a
professional supermarket, sir.

288
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
“Well done.”

289
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,090
Where did that come from?

290
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,550
Because I think he said, “Imagine him in
the supermarket”

291
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,940
and that’s all that was there,

292
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,560
for that brief second, the word ‘supermarket’.

293
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,080
Supermarket.
He became a Londis, that’s what happened.

294
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,360
Pick a word, any word!

295
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,300
He was pulling bottles of wine out from under
the kilt that he’s not wearing.

296
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,900
Nail bar?!

297
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,240
Parachutist.

298
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Oh.

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,540
There are stories of him
assisting a medical convoy,

300
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,970
coordinating evacuations,
all sorts of things like that,

301
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,620
and then, coming back to England,

302
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,370
went back and made
another appearance in a film.

303
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,490
Was he in a Bond film?

304
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,360
No, he was in ‘Ivanhoe’.

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,010
What did he appear as?

306
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,140
A bagpipe.

307
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
Close.

308
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,140
A longbowman.

309
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,900
Yes, absolutely right.

310
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,980
What skill did he pick up in late 1950s Australia?

311
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,080
Boomerang wanging?

312
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,200
No, no, no, because...

313
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,300
Wanging being a very specific word there.

314
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,090
I think that 'that action'
could conceivably be called a wang.

315
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,720
Technically it’s 'boomerwanging'.

316
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,760
No, a wang is underarm isn’t it?

317
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
As in 'welly wanging'.

318
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Ah…

319
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,350
Definition of the wang there everyone.

320
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,970
The phrase 'welly wanging' was just lost on
half the audience.

321
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,210
Gumboot throwing if you are
from the home counties.

322
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,660
Don’t they have the word welly?

323
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,020
I don’t know.

324
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,120
It’s a wellington isn’t it?

325
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
As in, after Wellington,

326
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,540
but it also brings me back to the excellently-named

327
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,640
1980s computer company from Oxfordshire, Wang.

328
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,600
Oxford United, in the 1980s, were sponsored
by Wang.

329
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,230
So, on the front of their shirts, for years
and years,

330
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,130
was the word Wang, repeatedly.

331
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,970
Late 1950s Australia,
what was being developed there?

332
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,970
Surfing.

333
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,670
Yes, absolutely right.

334
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,590
He became passionate and, I’m quoting here,

335
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,980
“Passionate devotee of the surfboard,

336
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,460
“one of the first people in Britain to surf.”

337
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,030
And, specifically, one of the first people
in Britain to surf what?

338
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,030
Severn Bore.

339
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,520
Point, you’re absolutely right.

340
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,220
That’s the tidal river thing isn’t it?

341
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,232
Yes, the tidal surge.

342
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:50,470
Yes, there is a single tidal wave

343
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,690
that on particularly strong tides rolls up
the River Severn.

344
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,730
And nowadays it’s filled with surfers and
boats and drones flying overhead.

345
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,010
It was just this guy on a surfboard.

346
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,200
One pissed off guy from Ceylon,
playing the bagpipes,

347
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,810
swinging a claymore round his head,

348
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,840
having finally conquered another element.

349
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,000
Imagine opening your curtains and…

350
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,160
“Can you hear bagpipes?”
“I can’t hear bagpipes.”

351
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,260
“That’s completely impossible by this
placid River Severn

352
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,760
“with the occasional... oh, sweet Georgia.”

353
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,700
“Daaaaagh!

354
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,780
“Bristol, you’re mine!”

355
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,540
Did he end up declaring war on himself?

356
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,080
In retirement, it says, his-

357
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,180
Retirement!

358
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,500
As if he’s going to retire!

359
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,230
How is this man going to retire?

360
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,900
“…his eccentricity continued.”

361
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
No way!

362
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,410
You’d have thought he’d have settled down.

363
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,330
People, when they hit their retirement, they’re
usually so placid.

364
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,080
I’ve seen ‘Last of the Summer-’

365
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Was he doing ‘Last of the Summer Wine’
only with claymores?

366
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
Bathtub.

367
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,140
“Aaaagh!”

368
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,760
He startled train conductors and passengers-

369
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,000
How?

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,530
By throwing his briefcase out of the train
window each day on the ride home.

371
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,530
Why?

372
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,970
Did he try and get it in
one of the Post Office nets

373
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,290
for the Travelling Post Offices?

374
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,380
The what?

375
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,780
The way they used to pick up mail
in ye olden days,

376
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,050
not the olden days but the days of Travelling
Post Offices,

377
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,300
you would have a hook
by the side of the railway line.

378
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,930
They would dangle a bag full of mail,

379
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,380
at which point the carriage
would come towards it,

380
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,930
it had a bit of sticky out net that would
be dropped out at exactly the right moment,

381
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,770
would hit the hook, the mail bag would drop
into the net

382
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,300
and be sprung into the carriage,

383
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,160
at which time another hook would be slung
out from the train

384
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,380
with another bag of mail that would be dropped
in the same location, like that.

385
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Wow.

386
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,330
Precise timing and speed and location.

387
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,120
In such a way that they don’t have to stop
to pick up the mail and drop the mail.

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
- Exactly, it just goes.
- The train goes…

389
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,540
And then the post has happened!

390
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,860
And then the letters be(!)

391
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,280
This is the night mail, crossing the border...!

392
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,520
Well, that’s the noise of it isn’t it?

393
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,200
And suddenly, bag.

394
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,690
And in this case, briefcase and claymore,

395
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,020
and angry man from Ceylon.

396
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,740
He wasn’t trying to get it on the mail pole.

397
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,060
He was aiming for a specific target.

398
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
His garden?

399
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,040
Oh, that is amazing.

400
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,380
I want to do that on the way home.

401
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,720
It doesn’t quite work in the tube but…

402
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,040
I was going to say.

403
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,280
I was going to say, which really sucked when
he moved to London.

404
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,820
He lived to the age of 90.

405
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,240
I’m not surprised, who could kill him?

406
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,740
Death just walked away.

407
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,590
He died in 1996

408
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,400
and was later named one of the finest explorers
and adventurers of all time.

409
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,570
By himself.

410
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,100
By the Royal Norwegian Explorers Club.

411
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,300
At the end of the show, congratulations Chris,

412
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,190
you obviously win this one, for the...

413
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,760
Yes, you won this one 30 seconds in.

414
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,890
“Is that the madman with the claymore?”

415
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,020
Yes, yes it is, that’s absolutely right.

416
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,380
I’m going to say that’s up there as a
record, it really is.

417
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,970
Congratulations, you win two words mixed together

418
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,860
by the actor who played Padme
in the ‘Star Wars’ prequels.

419
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
No!

420
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,340
It’s a 'Natalie Portmanteau'.

421
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,460
I like that.

422
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,290
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel.

423
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,220
Thank you.

424
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,460
To Gary Brannan.

425
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,660
To Matt Gray.

426
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,720
I’ve been Tom Scott and we’ll see you
next time.
