1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,370
Who is driving the violence in Hong Kong?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,750
Police or Protesters?

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,760
Is Hong Kong on the verge of collapse?

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,920
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,930
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,560
Joining me today is Kevin Carrico,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,169
a lecturer at Monash University.

8
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:23,340
His research focuses on China-Hong Kong relations.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,119
Thanks for joining me today, Kevin.

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,210
Thanks for having me.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,140
These protests have been going on for over
a hundred days.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,430
How have they changed and evolved over that
time?

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,510
I think that we've seen a cycle of rising
tension

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:49,010
and mutual escalation between both protesters
and police.

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,929
When I was here June 12th,

16
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:58,129
the day that really started the current wave
of protests-

17
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,539
When the police fired all the tear gas.

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,539
Yeah.

19
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,819
It was the day that the extradition bill

20
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,880
was supposed to be passed,

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,110
and people were very eager to surround the
legislative council

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,420
to prevent that bill from being passed.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:22,270
What I noticed at the time I think was on
the one hand,

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,619
there was still a very real emphasis

25
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:31,979
on being very I think peaceful,

26
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:40,649
very non-provocative in relations with the
police.

27
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:50,579
I think there was also a genuine fear of being
arrested.

28
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,770
What I think I have observed over the summer,

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:03,869
over the past three months is certainly I
think

30
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,760
a cycle of escalation wherein peaceful protest

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,140
has been met by the police with really disproportionate
force.

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:22,720
This has led protesters to, in varying ways,

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,800
fight back, setting up barricades.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,160
In some cases, even throwing Molotov cocktails
or bricks

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,660
again in limited cases.

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,580
This has then led to the police just being
evermore aggressive

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,860
and evermore unreasonable and evermore violent.

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,340
This of course led to the ultimate escalation
on National Day

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,190
when police, after a warning that they may
have

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,040
to do to this at some point to,

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,430
actually used live rounds on protesters

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,330
in a situation in which that was,

43
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,480
in my opinion, completely unnecessary and
a criminal act.

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,660
Besides this obvious mutual escalation,

45
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,470
the point that really stands out to me is
that, sure,

46
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:37,350
regular citizens are scared of the police
when they show up.

47
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,350
I certainly am.

48
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,350
Yeah.

49
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,830
People are not scared of the protesters

50
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,990
despite the police portraying the protesters

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,640
as unlawful hooligans and things like that.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,780
When people really get scared is when the
police show up.

53
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,560
I feel that I have noticed from June 12th
until October 1st,

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,740
I do feel like protesters are considerably

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,480
less scared of being arrested.

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,100
Being arrested in a protest used to be such
an exceptional,

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,219
such a rare event in Hong Kong,

58
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,689
but over the past three months,

59
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,490
we've literally seen thousands of people taken
in.

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,560
On the morning of October 2nd,

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,539
a total of 96 people appeared in court

62
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,330
related to charges of rioting.

63
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,629
This kind of massive,

64
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,229
expansive police violence and really indiscriminate
use

65
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,060
of politicized charges against protesters,

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,419
it's having the opposite effect of what's
intended

67
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,870
insofar as just making people first of all

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,520
less scared of repercussions,

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,270
and second of all,

70
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,300
more determined to fight back against this.

71
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,469
I know you mentioned that at the beginning,

72
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,620
these protests were focused on the extradition
bill.

73
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,800
That doesn't really seem to be the focus anymore.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,310
I think the focus right now is really on

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,270
demanding some kind of police accountability.

76
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,919
This has been sadly completely lacking.

77
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,250
Carrie Lam keeps backing the police officers.

78
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,319
Yeah.

79
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,910
I don't know if Carrie Lam actually

80
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:51,530
has the power right to oversee or to I suppose
require

81
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,480
an independent investigation into police behavior.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,900
Well, I don't understand.

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,050
Hong Kong is under one country, two systems.

84
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,840
Shouldn't the Hong Kong government have the
authority?

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,060
Is there perhaps some other power?

86
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,699
Yeah, there is another power.

87
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,729
We're not talking about Jesus, are we?

88
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,029
No, no we're not.

89
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:20,810
I think of course there's the power to the
north, Beijing.

90
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,779
I think there's also the power just a few
blocks over

91
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:31,949
from where we're filming, at the Wan Chai
police station.

92
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:38,229
I don't actually know if Carrie Lam

93
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:44,879
has control over the Hong Kong police force
any more at this point.

94
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,990
I don't know exactly what her intentions are.

95
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,809
If she actually for some reason wanted to
have

96
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:58,009
a real independent investigation into police
conduct,

97
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,009
of course, there's the issue of Beijing, but
at a deeper level,

98
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,770
I think there's the issue of police here

99
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:11,650
and whether police are any longer accountable

100
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,379
and under the control of the government.

101
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:20,900
I think we very much saw that on October 1st.

102
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,430
Speaking of October 1st, National Day,

103
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,280
we were both in Hong Kong on National Day.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,719
That's the day that celebrates the communist
takeover of China.

105
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,660
Tell us about what you saw that day.

106
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,490
There are always I think far too many police
at these gatherings.

107
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,099
It's actually when the police arrive, of course,

108
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:49,779
that one begins to see violence unfortunately.

109
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,270
I participated in the illegal gathering,

110
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,509
walking from Causeway Bay all the way over
to Central

111
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,740
and a little bit beyond.

112
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,830
The protests, despite supposedly being illegal,

113
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:16,289
despite being unauthorized, was very orderly,
very peaceful.

114
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,449
People walked along the street,

115
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,999
voicing of course the five demands as well
as

116
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:28,770
their discontent with the Hong Kong government
and police.

117
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,759
That's a polite way to put it.

118
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:38,400
Of course, the central government.

119
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,840
I was in Central as people seem to be dispersing.

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:54,890
When I was walking at an intersection where
there's Cartier

121
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,770
and Louis Vuitton and things like that

122
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,850
and I was just doing a little window shopping,

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,140
going to get a new LV bag.

124
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,600
Somebody says to me,

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,770
"Oh sir, you better walk a little faster."

126
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,900
I didn't know quite what that meant.

127
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,930
That person seemed to be a protester.

128
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:28,630
Within a minute, the police had begun firing
teargas

129
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,320
I believe from inside an MTR station.

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,970
While the police escalated their use of force
in Central,

131
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,060
I made my way over to the legislative council
building

132
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,870
where at the time,

133
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,030
a fairly large crowd had gathered.

134
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,620
Perhaps around 500, 600 people on the street,

135
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,630
outside the legislative council and outside
of the PLA barracks.

136
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,370
I made my way out there just as of course

137
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,320
the police escalated their use of force there,

138
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,260
I saw at the legislative council,

139
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,270
the police firing teargas

140
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,340
from the top of the legislative council building

141
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,060
down on to the street,

142
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,080
which of course I think anybody can understand

143
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,450
is not a particularly safe way to fire.

144
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,530
No, I think that's actually not ...

145
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,920
You're not supposed to do it like that.

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Yeah.

147
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,680
If I stood on top of the legislative council
building

148
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,220
and threw a can of Coke or a bottle,

149
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,950
that would be considered dangerous.

150
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,240
For some reason, when the police fire tear
gas rounds

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,970
indiscriminately from the legislative council
building,

152
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,390
this is considered okay.

153
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,900
I was happy to see that at least one teargas
round that I saw

154
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,970
seemed to have been picked up by protesters

155
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,940
and thrown into what appeared to be the PLA
barracks

156
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,380
next to the legislative council building

157
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,510
to great rounds of applause.

158
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,810
That was I think a really important

159
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,200
and wonderful gift for the PRC.

160
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,450
For the birthday.

161
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,450
Yeah, its 70th birthday.

162
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,450
Wow.

163
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,680
As we dispersed from the road

164
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,380
outside of the legislative council building,

165
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,490
people moved north to Pacific Place,

166
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,820
which is near where I am staying.

167
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,781
I saw literally thousands of young people

168
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:56,920
just set up on Queensway just outside of Pacific
Place.

169
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,350
That was actually the street

170
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,230
where I first really experienced teargas

171
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,860
on June 12th.

172
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,300
Special place for you.

173
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,980
Yeah, it has a lot of sentimental value for
me.

174
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,700
I watched actually from above,

175
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,030
from the lower block of the high court,

176
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:24,730
which is just maybe one level up from the
street.

177
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,350
As police proceeded down the street with the
big,

178
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,230
goofy water cannon providing them support

179
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:42,180
and basically just acted like rabid dogs

180
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,830
or some kind of angry, pissed off animals,

181
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,030
and just charging forward, yelling,

182
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,010
pointing their teargas guns indiscriminately
at people.

183
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,480
They pointed the teargas gun up at me as I
was watching.

184
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,220
You probably seemed like a threat.

185
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,570
Yeah, indeed.

186
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:18,850
That's me, very threatening as I watched from
above.

187
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,550
If that had happened three months ago, I would've
thought,

188
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,010
oh, well, they're just pointing it up.

189
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,560
They're not going to fire it.

190
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,260
At this point in the unfolding of this entire
protest movement

191
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,490
and the police response to it,

192
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,860
I was no longer confident that the police

193
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,100
weren't just going to randomly

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,830
just shoot a teargas canister at my head.

195
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,530
I of course backed away,

196
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:59,050
ducking down to watch as the police charged
forward,

197
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,330
randomly grabbing and beating people

198
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:08,240
and generally just acting in a way t

199
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:17,440
hat I suppose was a great gift to Beijing
on its 70th anniversary

200
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,680
to see that really the Hong Kong police have,

201
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,200
just like the PRC police,

202
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,690
essentially become just a political tool

203
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,430
for the oppression of the people living here.

204
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,890
Did this change how you view

205
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,500
the protests or the protesters?

206
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,570
I've always been, to put it lightly,

207
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,220
supportive of the protests.

208
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:59,750
I tend to disagree with a number of know-it-alls

209
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:06,120
and other analysts who have claimed that the
protest movement

210
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,940
needs to be more moderate,

211
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,940
needs to make some kind of compromise.

212
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,340
Really, what I saw on October 1st really

213
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:33,080
was just pretty straightforward suppression

214
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,910
of people's legally guaranteed rights under
the basic law,

215
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,760
using the most extreme forms of violence,

216
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:54,860
even including firing live rounds into teenagers'
chests.

217
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,840
For that reason,

218
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:07,000
I certainly feel that I not only support the
protests,

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,220
but I also support really any measure I think

220
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,570
that protesters use at this point

221
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,170
to push back against a violent and a repressive
regime.

222
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,440
I stepped away from October 1st,

223
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,860
moving from a pretty much no judgment zone
of protesters

224
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,570
to officially no judgment,

225
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,660
feeling that whatever happens,

226
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:54,130
it's important for people to continue to fight
back against

227
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,380
what I consider a repressive colonial regime

228
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,060
by really any means necessary.

229
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,380
You mentioned the protester

230
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,539
who was shot point blank in the chest by a
police officer.

231
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,689
How do you think that's going to affect the
situation?

232
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,589
Well, to put it lightly,

233
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,519
I don't think that's going to bring an end
to the protest.

234
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,519
No?

235
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,519
No.

236
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,169
I know that the police are stupid

237
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:27,480
and so they think that basically by using
live rounds,

238
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,710
perhaps they can scare people away,

239
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,740
and perhaps people won't come out.

240
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:46,409
Now, the decision to shoot a high school student

241
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:52,140
at point blank range in the chest,

242
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,759
it's a show of strong force,

243
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,890
a show of essentially willingness

244
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,919
to do anything to stay in power,

245
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
but it's also a demonstration

246
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,309
of a complete lack of understanding

247
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:17,760
for or rather complete disregard

248
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,340
of Hong Kong public opinion

249
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,970
insofar as everyone that I have spoken to

250
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,029
is outraged by and disgusted by this decision

251
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,320
to use that kind of live force.

252
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,870
Particularly when the policeman involved

253
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,820
had a rubber bullet gun in his other hand,

254
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,730
which I don't know about other people,

255
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,789
but if I was in that situation,

256
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,179
if I did fear for my life,

257
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,990
I would feel more comfortable,

258
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,570
if I had to, firing a rubber bullet

259
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,749
than firing a real bullet into a kid's chest.

260
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,370
It seems like the Hong Kong government,

261
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,279
their strategy or their hope has been that
eventually

262
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,909
the mainstream Hong Kong society

263
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,270
will turn against the protesters,

264
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,690
but that has not happened.

265
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,490
Why is that?

266
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:27,490
Because the government makes it so easy

267
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,279
to be opposed to the government.

268
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,330
They constantly miscalculate and mismanage.

269
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,370
As I said before,

270
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,100
if they had withdrawn this bill on June 12th,

271
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,990
none of this would have ever happened.

272
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,309
If they had shown some basic accountability

273
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,350
and done an investigation in the police violence

274
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,120
after June 12th,

275
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,510
this wouldn't have escalated further.

276
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,840
Really, basically, their response

277
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,100
to this entire protest movement,

278
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,669
if we use the metaphor of a fire building
up,

279
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,059
the Hong Kong government and the central government's
response

280
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,799
seems to think that, oh,

281
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,840
if we just pour another canister of gasoline
on this,

282
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,389
the fire will eventually burn out.

283
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:34,059
That's unfortunately not how things work.

284
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,690
While the government does seem to hope

285
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,240
that public opinion will turn against the
protesters,

286
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,039
every step of the way,

287
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:51,490
every stupid moment of bungling mismanagement

288
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,860
just pushes general public opinion

289
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,299
ever further away from the Hong Kong government

290
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:02,039
and of course the central government that
they represent

291
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:08,240
and leads to new concerns and new demands.

292
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,879
With the Chinese Communist Party

293
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:12,659
as the ultimate authority in Hong Kong,

294
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,760
how do you think these protests will end?

295
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,140
That's the thing.

296
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,380
I don't know how this will end.

297
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,460
I don't see any way that this will quiet down
or slow down.

298
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:40,529
These orthodoxies have faded away in the anger
and resentment

299
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,039
and disgust of this summer,

300
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,769
so that even if things do eventually quiet
down,

301
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,750
which is not something I actually see happening
anytime soon

302
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,549
but certainly could happen at some point,

303
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:08,690
I think the effects of this will be long lasting
and inerasable.

304
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,080
I don't really think Chinese rule over Hong
Kong

305
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,059
will ever be the same again.

306
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,360
Thank you so much for joining me today.

307
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Be safe out there.

308
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,040
Oh yeah.

309
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,860
Thank you.

310
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,480
You too.

311
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
Thanks.
