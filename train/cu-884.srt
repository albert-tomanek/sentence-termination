1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,420
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,710
if the South China Sea is dominated by China,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,980
then the Indian Ocean should be dominated
by...

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,240
China! Obviously.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,789
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,769
Well folks, I have good news and bad news.

8
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,769
The good news is that India and China probably
aren’t

9
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,679
entering a Cold War era nuclear submarine
race.

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,630
The bad news is it could actually be worse.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,230
And it turns out the US might be right in
the middle of it.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,660
China and India are the two most populous
countries on earth.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,010
They’re also economic rivals,

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,320
share the world’s longest contested land
border,

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,600
and are importing more weapons than any other
countries out there.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,560
What could go wrong?

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,860
You see, just because the South China Sea
clearly belongs to China,

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,400
doesn’t mean the Indian Ocean belongs to
India.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,080
A senior captain from China’s National Defense
University made that clear.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,000
Now that wasn’t some kind of threat, obviously.

21
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,270
But just for the sake of argument,

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,670
if you were wondering how many submarines
China would need

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,549
to blockade India,

24
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,969
the answer is 10.

25
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,389
Not like they've thought about it before,

26
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:21,649
but it would be 10.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,120
And the 18 naval bases the Chinese regime
is building

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,439
along key trade chokepoints surrounding the
Indian Ocean

29
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,969
would have no part in such a purely hypothetical
blockade.

30
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh, and that nuclear submarine that was patrolling

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,710
around the Gulf of Aden last year? Don’t
worry.

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,799
That was just to hunt pirates.

33
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,009
Because submarines are the best choice for
that.

34
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,859
You also shouldn’t worry about the two Chinese
submarines

35
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,359
that docked in Pakistan last year.

36
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,369
You know, Pakistan: India’s nuclear-armed rival.

37
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,009
The Chinese were probably just showing off
the goods

38
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,039
to help secure that 8-sub construction deal
they

39
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,979
finalized toward the end of last year.

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,139
And yet for some reason,

41
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,150
India seems nervous about the frequent visits
Chinese submarines

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,400
are making to the Indian Ocean.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,230
As if China’s rapid buildup of artificial
islands was just

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,250
"an effort to break out of the South China
Sea,

45
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,220
and then project into the Indian Ocean,"

46
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,480
you know, as "one of the opening moves in
China’s quest

47
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,980
for global military and economic dominance."

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
Ridiculous!

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,300
But just in case, India and the US

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,960
started off the month with talks about anti-submarine
warfare.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,240
For decades, India has maintained its distance
from the US.

52
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,350
But China’s recent submarine activities
have changed that.

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,430
India and the US have conducted joint military
exercises before,

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,570
but now they’re stepping it up.

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,340
Last month, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter
and his Indian counterpart

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,700
issued a joint statement saying they would
strengthen military ties.

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,320
Part of that meant India would finally allow
the US military

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,100
access to Indian military bases.

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,830
The US, for its part,

60
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,110
has agreed to give India access to weapons
technology,

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,940
like the P-8, its most advanced submarine
hunter.

62
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,900
Apparently it can track a sub from the sky.

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,980
This is all to help India narrow its military
gap with China.

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,900
And believe me, the gap is pretty darn big.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,480
China has the biggest navy in Asia, with 300
vessels.

66
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,830
62 of them are submarines, 4 of which can
fire nuclear ballistic missiles,

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,040
according to a report by the Pentagon last
year.

68
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,340
India has less than half as many ships,

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,120
including only one nuclear sub,

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,080
which is on lease from Russia.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,280
And both countries have a lot at stake.

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,940
China and India get more than 40 percent

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,080
of their GDP from international trade.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,200
So it makes sense that they would both want
to secure

75
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,560
the tremendously profitable ocean trade routes.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,480
But the US is the world leader in anti-submarine
warfare.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,180
It got a lot of experience from going through
a very similar situation

78
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,010
with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

79
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,890
Though with one very key difference.

80
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,640
According to this report by the Lowy Institute,

81
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,349
the threat of nuclear annihilation
kept tensions

82
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:19,569
between the US and the Soviets from escalating.

83
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,139
But as for India and China,

84
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,389
their submarines are both too few in number

85
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,960
and not technologically advanced enough

86
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,270
to be an effective nuclear deterrent.

87
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,389
In other words, back in the day,

88
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,479
both the US and the Soviets knew that if they
launched a nuclear attack first,

89
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,830
they wouldn’t be able to stop the other
side from launching one of theirs.

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,379
But with China and India,

91
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,460
each might feel that they could launch a nuke,

92
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,650
and still successfully stop the other side
from detonating one of their own.

93
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,259
This might then be a problem that both India
and China

94
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,039
want to pump up their sub presence.

95
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,590
Then when you add to that Pakistan and North
Korea

96
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,509
are both trying to get nuclear subs,

97
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,879
on top of US presence in the region,

98
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,660
well, it’s getting a little crowded over
there.

99
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,340
But not to be outdone with that whole

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,180
being-able-to-blockade-you thing,

101
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,020
later this year, India, the US, and Japan,

102
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,860
will be holding joint military drills near
the Philippines.

103
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,800
That’ll be sure to ease tensions.

104
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,290
But you know what kind of sub the Chinese
Communist Party fears the most?

105
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,240
