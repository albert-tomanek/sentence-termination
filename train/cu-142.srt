China Uncensored host, Chris Chappell

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,300
came to Taiwan on November 19,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,720
and held a fan meet-up.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,540
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,880
Chris Chappell!

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,840
So two years ago,

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,020
I was in Hong Kong for the Umbrella Revolution.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,660
Did I ever say I narrowly escaped death?

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,420
Let the record show that we narrowly escaped death.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,220
Every country that I'm traveling to,

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,340
I will have narrowly escaped death.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,500
One thing I want to make very clear is, on the show,

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,980
I never want to have anyone think,

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,340
"China is bad. We should get rid of China."

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,140
The problem is the Chinese Communist Party,

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,920
which has trashed China,

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,600
which has brought a lot of damage to the Chinese people,

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,240
the Communist Party is the problem.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,900
Alright, any more questions? Yes?

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,140
With the new Trump presidency...

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,720
- I knew this would happen!

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,540
Thank you for coming, I'll see you all later!

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,440
I just want to give a big thank you to Arthere CafÃ©

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,620
for hosting the China Uncensored Taiwan fan meet-up.

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,020
If you're ever in Taiwan, be sure to check it out.

26
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,880
They've got great food and great drinks.
