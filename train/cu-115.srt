1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,130
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,450
we look back at the year

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,340
that made China great again.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:13,519
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,860
Congratulations!

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,060
We’ve made it through 2017

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,619
without a single nuclear war.

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,800
You can breathe a sigh of relief.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,869
Although, there’s still a couple days left...

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,310
Hope I didn’t just jinx it for everyone.

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,430
Anyway, so many things happened in 2017,

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,290
that we constantly forgot what happened last
week,

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,500
let alone last January.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
But don’t worry,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,490
I’m here to help.

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,150
Together, we shall relive

18
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,310
the ten biggest China stories of the year

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,000
in all of their glory.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,460
Starting with...

21
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Number 10

22
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,240
The China-India border conflict

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,620
Back in June, India and China came close to
war

24
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,640
over a border dispute...

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
again.

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,900
The Chinese regime loves

27
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,050
a good old-fashioned border conflict.

28
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,080
After all,

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,360
so much of the world has been a part of China

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,890
since ancient times,

31
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,789
that border disputes just

32
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,040
come with the territory.

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,560
This conflict was over this piece of land
in Bhutan,

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,850
the Doklam Plateau.

35
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,880
China was building a road through it,

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,170
roads that India is afraid could be used

37
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,640
to move Chinese troops into India someday.

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,159
So India was only too happy to send troops
in,

39
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,400
you know, to help their friends in Bhutan.

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,369
That led to a military standoff with China
that lasted 74 days.

41
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,539
Ultimately the status quo prevailed.

42
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,600
But there was plenty of time for Indian media

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,370
to make some pretty cool animations.

44
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,370
Number 9

45
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,430
Guo Wengui

46
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,399
The mysterious Chinese billionaire

47
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,479
stormed onto the scene earlier this year,

48
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,790
with an 82 million dollar Manhattan condo,

49
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,409
his own YouTube channel

50
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,200
and an endless stream of thirsty workout videos
on Twitter.

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,520
Guo began revealing all the secrets of China’s
elite—

52
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,369
using confusing conspiracy-

53
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,140
type diagrams on Twitter.

54
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,740
Wow, that is...convincing.

55
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,329
And so helpful.

56
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,049
The Chinese regime even tried to extradite
Guo,

57
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,160
and got Interpol to post a red notice for
him.

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,310
Now far be it for me to criticize someone

59
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,560
for using the internet to criticize CCP members.

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,900
But, surprise!

61
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,330
It’s more complicated than that.

62
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,500
Guo has been exposing officials linked to
Xi Jinping.

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,880
But there are indications that Guo is actually

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,990
closely linked to China’s spy network,

65
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,460
and that he’s mainly interested in destabilizing

66
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,700
cronies of Xi, like Wang Qishan.

67
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,170
Guo may be connected to a political faction

68
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,310
within the CCP that’s tied to former Chinese
leader

69
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,330
and mass murderer Jiang Zemin.

70
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,020
As Guo said once:

71
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,400
“Over the past 20-30 years,

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
without Jiang Zemin,

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,250
China couldn’t achieve today’s accomplishments...

74
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,250
In China today,

75
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,240
Jiang Zemin holds 80% of the power.”

76
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,420
So it’s unclear whether Guo Wengui is a
dissident

77
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,760
trying to expose real problems inside China,

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,140
or whether he’s mainly interested in

79
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,400
taking down political rivals.

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,820
But one thing’s for sure:

81
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,010
We’re going to be seeing a lot more of Guo
in 2018.

82
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,640
And probably still in vertical video.

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Number 8

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,850
Hong Kong goes Wrong

85
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,140
2017 marked the 20th anniversary

86
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,000
of the British handover of Hong Kong

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
to the Chinese Communist Party.

88
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,100
Part of that agreement was that Hong Kong

89
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,060
gets to keep the freedoms it enjoyed

90
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,520
under British rule,

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,810
freedoms denied in Mainland China

92
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,250
for at least 50 years.

93
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,280
Well 20 years is almost 50 years, right?

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,650
Because those freedoms are on the way out!

95
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,830
A British citizen was denied entry.

96
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,560
Democratically elected lawmakers

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,300
critical of the Chinese Communist Party

98
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,070
were purged.

99
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,830
And student activists were jailed.

100
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,040
And let’s not forget that in mainland China,

101
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,010
you can now be sent to prison for three years

102
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,180
for disrespecting the national anthem.

103
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,720
That law is coming soon to a Hong Kong near
you.

104
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,540
Wow that was depressing.

105
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,790
Moving on to...

106
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,990
Number 7

107
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,280
A bad year for dissidents

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,530
To be fair,

109
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,470
every year is a bad year for dissidents in
China.

110
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,189
But this year there were a lot of cases

111
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,409
that got media attention.

112
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,400
Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che

113
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,120
was abducted by Chinese police

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,770
while visiting mainland China

115
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,060
earlier in the year

116
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,879
and was just sentenced to five years in jail.

117
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,370
Also hit for subversion,

118
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,300
Chinese rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong.

119
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Another Chinese lawyer,

120
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,280
Gao Zhisheng, disappeared...

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,770
Only to finally reappear again…

122
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,870
in police custody.

123
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,509
And international headlines were made

124
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,599
when Chinese dissident

125
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,169
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate

126
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,249
Liu Xiaobo was released from prison—

127
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,699
and then almost immediately died.

128
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,060
It was from cancer.

129
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,250
Totally unrelated to all the years of abuse
in prison.

130
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,469
You see, “Rights groups say

131
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,779
a pattern has emerged in recent years

132
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,650
where China releases activists from prison

133
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,780
in poor health,

134
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,030
or only weeks before they pass away.”

135
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,229
When really,

136
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,889
we should be thanking the CCP

137
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,669
for allowing dissidents to be tortured in
prison

138
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:13,900
instead of just getting shot,

139
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,840
like in the old days.

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040
See?

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,430
That’s...more cheerful.

142
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,680
Number 6

143
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,260
Forced evictions

144
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,759
The poor migrant workers

145
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,949
who flocked to Beijing over the last decade

146
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,349
helped fuel China’s economic growth.

147
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,620
And the Communist Party is looking out for
them.

148
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,009
After a fire broke out in a shoddy building

149
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,979
in a migrant neighborhood on the outskirts
of Beijing,

150
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,539
Chinese police were quickly on the scene...

151
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,129
throwing everyone out into the sub zero weather

152
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,370
with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,370
You know,

154
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,529
In the name of fire safety.

155
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,509
It absolutely had nothing to do with

156
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,440
Beijing’s population control plan

157
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,800
that was announced just a few months before.

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
Or that the land is worth big bucks

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,050
to real estate developers.

160
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,159
The forced evictions caused a huge outcry
within China,

161
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,240
despite the Chinese regime’s desperate attempts

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,689
to censor all news about it.

163
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,749
And for some reason,

164
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,469
Chinese authorities also felt it was necessary

165
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,289
to shut down donations and charity people

166
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,210
were trying to give to the evicted migrants.

167
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,969
And this was just the tip of the iceberg.

168
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,370
Which brings us to…

169
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,069
Number 5

170
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,069
Kindergarten Abuse

171
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,620
RYB kindergarten has been accused of

172
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,150
stabbing kids as young as three with needles,

173
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,080
feeding them mysterious pills,

174
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,389
even sexual abuse.

175
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,879
Now some of those accusations may be false.

176
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,560
At least according to Chinese police

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,419
and state-run media.

178
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,969
But the Chinese regime also decided

179
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,520
this was another scandal

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,770
worthy of massive censorship.

181
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,240
This, combined with the migrant evictions

182
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,850
happening at the same time,

183
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,080
made this the most censored couple of weeks

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,110
in the whole year.

185
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,229
The kindergarten abuse scandal was different

186
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,259
in that it affected China’s upper middle
class.

187
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,999
The ones who are supposed to be safe

188
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,449
from all the corruption under the Chinese
regime

189
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,240
because they keep their heads down,

190
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,860
don’t talk about politics,

191
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,169
and stick to making money.

192
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,319
Cleaning up this mess won’t be as easy

193
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,229
as bulldozing a bunch of migrant homes.

194
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,160
Ok, how about something happy...ish.

195
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,100
Number 4

196
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,199
US-China Bromance

197
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,199
It’s hard to believe,

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,020
but Donald Trump has only been president

199
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,919
for less than a year.

200
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:27,919
And in that time,

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,279
he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

202
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,159
have created a great relationship.

203
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,339
It all began with a meeting

204
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:37,270
at Trump’s pleasure palace in Xanadu back
in April.

205
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,639
And yes, the cake was amazing.

206
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,339
“I was at the table, we had finished dinner,

207
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,840
we were now having dessert,

208
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,229
and we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate
cake

209
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,589
that you have ever seen.”

210
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,529
Since then the relationship has only blossomed.

211
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,999
“A relationship with you and China

212
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,830
is a very important one to me.”

213
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,490
Especially when Trump visited China in November.

214
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,409
He got the star treatment.

215
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,449
They watched home movies together,

216
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,520
perused ancient artifacts,

217
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,440
and politely sat through a Peking opera.

218
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,639
President Trump even became the first foreign
leader

219
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,620
to dine in the Forbidden City.

220
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,770
But are they really the best of friends,

221
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,110
or is there maybe something more to relationship?

222
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,749
That brings us to…

223
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,319
Number 3

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
Nuking it out with North Korea

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,300
The Chinese regime is none too happy with

226
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,050
its nuclear neighbor to the northeast.

227
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,310
For years, China acted as the go-between

228
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,039
for the Kim Dynasty and the rest of the world.

229
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,269
It worked great!

230
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,269
Until

231
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,490
North Korea decided it didn’t want to play

232
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,220
by Beijing’s rules.

233
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,459
Not only North Korea do its

234
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,190
largest-ever nuclear test in September,

235
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,300
along with 16 ballistic missile tests this
year alone,

236
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,750
Kim Jong-un also sent assassins to kill

237
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,459
his half brother Kim Jong-Nam.

238
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,089
He was the guy the Chinese regime

239
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,160
ultimately wanted in charge of North Korea.

240
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,060
And each Communist regime used their state-run
media

241
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,459
to slam the other.

242
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,690
Of course the Chinese Communist Party

243
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,620
isn’t the only one upset at Kim Jong-un.

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,380
“Rocket man is on a suicide mission

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,060
for himself and his regime.”

246
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,040
Which is exactly what the Chinese regime is
afraid of:

247
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,230
US military action on the Korean peninsula.

248
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,920
Not only would that mean US troops

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,500
get a little too close for comfort;

250
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,019
that would also mean a collapse of the Kim
dynasty

251
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,840
and a flood of North Korean refugees into
China.

252
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,820
So President Trump has been pressuring China

253
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,480
in the best way he knows how...

254
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,760
with Twitter!

255
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,850
And maybe if China helps

256
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,160
by putting more sanctions on North Korea,

257
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,750
Trump will look the other way with that whole

258
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,589
“labeling China a currency manipulator”
thing.

259
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,350
And it seems Trump’s plan to use

260
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,980
his bromance with Xi Jinping

261
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
has worked to an extent.

262
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
The Chinese regime,

263
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,279
North Korea’s largest trading ally,

264
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,540
has placed tougher sanctions on North Korea.

265
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
But the Chinese regime

266
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,300
doesn’t want to push too hard.

267
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,010
Or else it could lead to the collapse of North
Korea,

268
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,040
and the very same refugee problem.

269
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,740
But at least we’ve averted nuclear war!

270
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
So far!

271
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Number 2

272
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,250
The Land Down Under

273
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,959
The Chinese regime has been buying influence

274
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,110
in political and social circles around the
world,

275
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,410
and this year,

276
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,170
Australia became the Foster’s-drinking

277
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,380
canary in the coal mine.

278
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,440
This is from June.

279
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,170
“A joint investigation by a team of journalists

280
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,370
from Four Corners and Fairfax Media

281
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,350
has exposed a concerted campaign

282
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,000
by the Chinese government and its proxies,

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,620
to infiltrate the Australian political process

284
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,600
to promote its own interests.”

285
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,839
The Chinese regime sent people

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,560
to infiltrate universities,

287
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,959
local community groups,

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,959
media,

289
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,050
and political leaders.

290
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,770
Yeah, how dare a country

291
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,370
send criminals to Australia!

292
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,910
In response,

293
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,829
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull

294
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,829
announced an overhaul to espionage

295
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,240
and intelligence laws.

296
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,540
And finally, Number 1

297
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,050
The Era of Xi Jinping Thought

298
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,399
The United States Constitution is all about

299
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,470
basic human rights

300
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,260
and checks and balances on government power.

301
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,561
The Chinese Communist Party’s constitution

302
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,120
is pretty much the same.

303
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,500
Only instead of basic human rights,

304
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,940
it guarantees the right of the Communist Party

305
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,620
to rule over all.

306
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,180
And instead of checks and balances,

307
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,870
it’s more about which leader

308
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,490
has checked their opponent

309
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,100
and knocked them off balance.

310
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,040
At this year’s 19th Party Congress,

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Xi Jinping got himself written into

312
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,020
the Communist Party’s Constitution.

313
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,380
It’s this bit:

314
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,589
the “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism

315
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,670
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

316
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,990
Notice Xi’s political opponent Jiang Zemin

317
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,800
doesn’t have his name in there.

318
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,399
Yes, it’s been a year of Xi Jinping

319
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,759
rising to even greater heights of power,

320
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,190
while dominating his political opponents.

321
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,149
And in the real world that translates

322
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,949
to state-run media making sure Xi Jinping

323
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:06,440
blocks out Jiang Zemin.

324
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
At this point,

325
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,810
challenging Xi is tantamount

326
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,930
to challenging the Communist Party itself.

327
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,480
But while that means Xi’s got the power,

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,230
it also means he’ll be the fall guy

329
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,320
if anything goes wrong.

330
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
And there’s a lot of things that could go
wrong.

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,370
An unbalanced economy,

332
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,370
bad debt,

333
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,970
apocalyptic pollution,

334
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,779
and a public that’s starting to wise up

335
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,279
to the fact that there might not be

336
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,759
much of a new China

337
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,610
with the Communist Party.

338
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,880
But all that can wait for 2018.

339
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,800
Thanks for spending an incredible year

340
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,279
with us here at China Uncensored.

See you in 2018!

343
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,360
Should old acquaintance be forgot

344
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,350
and never brought to mind?

345
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,920
Of course not!

346
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,709

347
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,020
