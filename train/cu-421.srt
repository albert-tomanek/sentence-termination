1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,570
gosh, with all those sanctions on Iran and
North Korea,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,160
how do they keep developing their nuclear
programs?!

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,620
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,810
You know international law is a funny thing.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,430
Why, I can hardly stop laughing.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,689
There is no world government, officially,

9
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,311
so how do you get countries of the world

10
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:28,830
to work together when there’s really

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,989
no way to enforce anything?

12
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,110
Take for instance American trade sanctions

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,370
on Iran and North Korea.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,920
The European Union and a number of democratic
countries

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,690
have also had similar sanctions.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,690
The idea is,

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,550
if you restrict trading with these rogue regimes,

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,150
it’ll hopefully stop them from developing
nuclear weapons,

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,530
and generally being horrible to their own
citizens.

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,540
Think of it like some sort of

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,850
“no school lunch for bullies” policy.

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,440
But the Chinese regime doesn’t mind

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,319
swapping sandwiches with Iran and North Korea.

24
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:04,339
In fact, China is the biggest trading partner

25
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,729
for both of those countries.

26
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,729
This makes the rest of the world’s sanctions

27
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,220
way less effective.

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,270
Both the Obama and Trump administrations

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,510
have been repeatedly frustrated by

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,240
their inability to force China’s hand in

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
cracking down on these countries.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,329
So what can the US do?

33
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:27,149
Well, the Chinese company ZTE found out.

34
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,090
Never heard of ZTE?

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,660
This is one of their recent TV ads.

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,450
As you could tell from that commercial,

37
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,620
ZTE sells skateboards.

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,090
No, they actually sell cheap smartphones,

39
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,510
like the Blade V7 Lite.

40
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,159
Apparently, ZTE is the number 4 smartphone
vendor

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,180
in the US.

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,200
But smartphones are only a small part of their
business.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,009
ZTE is also one of the world's biggest makers

44
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,990
of telecommunications equipment.

45
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,210
But while these kids were doing sick tricks
on skateboards,

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,579
ZTE was doing some extremely illegal tricks

47
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,179
behind the US government’s back.

48
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,510
And eventually, they got caught.

49
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,590
An unprecedented US fine for sanctions busting.

50
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,280
The Chinese telecoms equipment giant ZTE

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,590
agreeing to pay more than a billion dollars
in penalties

52
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,150
and plead guilty to illegally shipping U.S.-made
technology

53
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,860
to Iran and North Korea.

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,340
ZTE is a Chinese company,

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,100
so you might think it wouldn’t be bound
by the US’s sanctions.

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,390
But 25 to 30% of ZTE’s components

57
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,060
come from US suppliers.

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,360
So when ZTE is shipping US-manufactured components

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,970
to Iran and North Korea,

60
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,700
that's illegal according to US law.

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,150
And since ZTE has a subsidiary company in
the US,

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,650
that gives the US government a legal hook

63
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,400
to go after them.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,870
With this action,

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,660
we are putting the world on notice:

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,510
Improper trade games are over with.

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,090
Those who flout our economic sanctions,

68
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,790
export control laws and any other trade regimes

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,780
will not go unpunished.

70
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,160
They will suffer the harshest of consequences.

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah, you lousy skateboarding teenagers!

72
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,340
The US began investigating ZTE five years
ago,

73
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,900
after this 2012 report from Reuters.

74
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,260
ZTE sold Iran,

75
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,150
“a powerful surveillance system capable
of monitoring landline,

76
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,040
mobile and internet communications”.

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,370
It was worth millions of dollars.

78
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,930
Their selling point?

79
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,379
It wasn’t Made in China,

80
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,770
but in the good old US of A.

81
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,990
Through the course of the investigation,

82
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,440
ZTE directly or indirectly shipped about

83
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,830
32 million dollars of US-made routers,

84
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,980
microprocessors and servers to Iran.

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,750
Plus it made 283 shipments to North Korea.

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,200
But that’s not the worst part.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,350
The worst part is,

88
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,590
they lied about it.

89
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,820
This top secret document written by ZTE’s
legal department

90
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,390
basically says, “Hey upper management,

91
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,450
you know all those illegal things we’re
doing,

92
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,580
like exporting US products to rogue nations?

93
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,010
Well, here’s some suggestions on

94
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,329
how to not get caught.”

95
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,870
Obviously they weren’t very good suggestions.

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,580
This unprecedented penalty reflects ZTE's
premeditated,

97
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,490
egregious scheme to evade U.S. law.

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,349
ZTE's most senior managers lied to,

99
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:44,120
obstructed and misled investigators for years,

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,370
only acknowledging the truth starting in March
2016

101
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,940
when we caught them red-handed.

102
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,300
Well yes, they are acknowledging it now!

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,949
That’s because, after getting caught red-handed,

104
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,330
ZTE installed a new chairman and chief executive.

105
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,360
And this one issued a formal corporate-style
apology.

106
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,900
So we’re cool, right?

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,880
Right?

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,040
At the beginning of this month,

109
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,900
ZTE plead guilty to the charges of illegal
shipping,

110
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,120
as well as a charge of obstructing justice

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,949
and lying to federal investigators.

112
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,919
The judge fined ZTE nearly 1.2 billion dollars—

113
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,969
although they can save 300 million

114
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:30,600
if they start complying with US restrictions.

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,680
And ZTE might not be the only Chinese company

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,770
with its US operations in trouble.

117
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,440
Remember that top secret ZTE document?

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,499
Well, on page 3,

119
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,090
it suggests looking at the example

120
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,729
of another Chinese telecom company

121
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,539
doing the same kind of illegal stuff.

122
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,840
They refer to it by the codename “F7”,

123
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,610
so there’s no way to know...

124
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,610
Just kidding.

125
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,610
It’s Huawei.

126
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,610
I mean, what other company

127
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,080
was trying to buy 3leaf in 2010?

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,149
Company “F7” was no mystery to US investigators
either.

129
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,539
Last year, Huawei was subpoenaed for similar
violations,

130
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,099
though no official charges have been levied
against it yet.

131
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,940
So what do ZTE and Huawei have in common?

132
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,449
I mean, besides selling US-made components

133
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,639
to Iran and North Korea?

134
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,539
They both have strong ties

135
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,020
to the Chinese Communist Party.

136
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,660
ZTE is a publicly traded company,

137
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,669
but it’s also a partially state-owned enterprise

138
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,590
through a complex holding company structure.

139
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,409
Huawei is privately owned,

140
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:38,030
but gets generous support from the Chinese
Communist Party,

141
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,349
including major funding from Chinese state-owned
banks.

142
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,810
The Party connections could explain

143
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,949
why both ZTE and Huawei are trading with countries

144
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,340
that have relatively small markets,

145
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,999
even when it means putting their US business
at risk.

146
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,629
As this article puts it,

147
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,870
“It is not surprising the companies

148
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,129
would tailor their export endeavors

149
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,669
to further Chinese foreign policy goals.”

150
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:03,669
Policy goals that include

151
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,860
supporting the Chinese regime’s allies:

152
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,909
Iran and North Korea.

153
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,090
Back in 2012,

154
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,279
the House of Representatives’ intelligence
committee

155
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,979
issued this report,

156
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,069
saying ZTE and Huawei specifically

157
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,849
were a “threat to US national security interests.”

158
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,879
One concern was that both companies had

159
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,720
refused to provide details about their operations
in Iran.

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,380
There were other concerns as well.

161
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,889
After that report was issued,

162
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,580
the US government restricted Huawei and ZTE

163
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,469
from selling their telecommunications equipment

164
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,860
in the US.

165
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
For example,

166
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,639
they couldn't sell infrastructure equipment

167
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,039
to US companies like Sprint and Verizon.

168
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,460
And they couldn’t sell anything to government
agencies

169
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,039
without FBI approval.

170
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,110
But they both can still sell smartphones.

171
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,500
In fact, one in every 13 smartphones sold
in the US today

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,259
are either ZTE or Huawei.

173
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,969
So what will be the impact of the recent guilty
plea

174
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,499
by ZTE about selling US components

175
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,880
to Iran and North Korea?

176
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,300
Well, if ZTE pays its fine,

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,509
and stops selling things to Iran and North
Korea,

178
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,160
it’ll get to continue operating here,

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,729
competing with other smartphone makers

180
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,240
like Apple and Samsung.

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,770
It's unclear though if the US government

182
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,289
will end restrictions on ZTE selling

183
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,419
telecommunications equipment in the US.

184
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,370
So should you go ahead and swap out

185
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,800
your exploding Samsung Galaxy

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
for a ZTE Blade V7 Lite?

187
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,880
Well, these skateboarders seem to think so.

188
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,310
But while you may be safe from explosions,

189
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,230
it doesn’t mean you’re safe from everything.

190
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,400
For the record,

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,890
a ZTE USA spokesperson said,

192
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,260
“no ZTE devices in the U.S.

193
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,040
have ever had the AdUps software”

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,390
which allowed the Chinese government

195
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,460
that secret backdoor to monitor your cell
phone data.

196
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,870
And I totally believe them.

197
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,790
I mean, why wouldn’t I trust ZTE?

198
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,010
So what do you think?

199
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,440
Leave your comments below.

200
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,690
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

201
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,350
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

202
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,620
See you next time.
