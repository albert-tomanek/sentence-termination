00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,071
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,650
North Korea is being a jerk again.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,769
So c'mon, China,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,780
What are you going to do about it?

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,369
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,070
Well, it's happened!

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,610
Despite sanctions and international condemnation,

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,350
North Korea detonated a nuclear bomb!

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,570
Again...

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
Last week, on January 6,

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,500
the world literally shook at this announcement
from the official Korean Central News Agency!

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,680
That's North Korea by the way.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,829
The hermit kingdom is now

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,530
"equipped with the most powerful nuclear deterrent."

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,760
No, not Kim Jong Un's hair.

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,970
A hydrogen bomb!

18
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,040
That's right,

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,800
North Korean state media says they successfully
detonated a thermonuclear warhead,

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,190
and it caused a 4.8 magnitude earthquake.

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,780
Which, in North Korea, is apparently cause
for celebration!

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,320
"I would like to express my deepest gratitude
to our party for guaranteeing the 10 million

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,220
year-future of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim
Jong Il's Korea."

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,080
Whoa.

25
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:11,920
Now North Korea has a history of making some
rather bold claims.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,220
Like, former leader Kim Jong-Il invented the
hamburger,

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,100
didn't need to go to the bathroom,

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,600
and upon his birth, a new star was born in
the sky,

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,389
a double rainbow appeared,

30
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:25,849
and the season instantaneously went from winter
to spring.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,480
That’s ridiculous!

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,940
Everyone knows that In-N-Out invented the
hamburger.

33
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:31,479
So obviously,

34
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,340
lies like these are why there's been some
doubt whether North Korea actually detonated

35
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,600
a hydrogen bomb.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,100
You see, a hydrogen bomb,

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,140
also called a thermonuclear bomb,

38
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,380
would be a major leap forward for them.

39
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,820
They're far more powerful than bombs North
Korea seems to have tested in previous years.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,800
But is it true?

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,860
When US tested a hydrogen bomb in 1971,

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,060
it caused a 6.8 earthquake. Last week's North
Korean detonation was only 4.8

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,639
slightly weaker than the 4.9 earthquake caused
by their 2013 nuclear test,

44
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,170
which was a regular atomic bomb.

45
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,229
So what do we actually know?!

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,010
"Well, we know it was a nuclear test."

47
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,360
Okay. But what else do we know?

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,860
"That you may want to derive more information
so that you can improve your analysis of an

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,880
event doesn't mean that you were taken aback
by an event or surprised by the event.

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,310
It's part of the analysis process and I am
not confirming in any way by the statement…"

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,950
It's like watching a deer caught in the headlights…

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,720
Come on!

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,640
This is the 4th nuclear test by North Korea
since 2006.

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Doesn't anyone have a clear plan on how to
deal with the very real threat of an nuclear-armed

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,920
North Korea?!

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,830
Ah, it appears South Korea does...

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,620
Ok. Their plan is to blast K-Pop across the
border.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,760
Anyone else have a plan?

59
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,700
"You do have a problem and you have a big
problem with North Korea and we're going to

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,170
talk to China and we're going to get a long
way with China and I love China because they

61
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,140
buy my apartments, they spend, you know, fortunes…"

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,490
Yeah it just goes on like that for a while
but

63
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,870
I think Donald Trump is on to something!

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,830
Don't quote me on that.

65
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,390
But yes, China can sort this out!

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,000
China is North Korea's only ally

67
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,210
and really, the only thing propping that country
up.

68
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,170
North Korea's GDP is a third of Ethiopia's.

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,820
And a lot of that is coming from trade with
China.

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,880
So China's in a good position to pressure
North Korea.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,940
"To resolve such kind of complex issue needs
more efforts from all sides.

72
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,430
The relevant party you just mentioned should
ask themselves honestly,

73
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,390
what constructive efforts have they made?"

74
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,380
Um...other countries put economic sanctions
on North Korea.

75
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,380
You could do the same.

76
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,450
You could even ban North Korean planes from
entering Chinese airspace.

77
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,759
I mean, China can't be happy about this.

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,260
The last four nuclear tests were all carried
out really close to the North Korea-China

79
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,380
border.

80
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,080
The earthquakes were felt in China.

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,100
This CCTV report says the Environmental Ministry
had to test

82
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,990
if the air, soil and snow were clear of radiation.

83
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,729
Though I'm not sure how they could tell,

84
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,430
with pollution that's already having the same
effect as a nuclear winter.

85
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,300
But the thing is, China loves North Korea
like a brother.

86
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,580
A mischievous little brother that makes you
look good in comparison.

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,100
Think China treats its citizens badly,

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
putting millions of innocent people in labor
camps that are like dark dens of hell?

89
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,240
Sure, but c'mon!

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,180
Look at North Korea!

91
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,500
See? China's not so bad!

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,700
And this relationship also gives China political
power.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,040
Because if you want to pressure North Korea,

94
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,420
you need China's buy-in.

95
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,260
And more importantly,

96
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,600
China wants to prevent North Korea from collapsing.

97
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,100
If North Korea falls,

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,260
China could have to deal with 25 million refugees
streaming across the border.

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,620
The world is barely been able to handle 4
million Syrian refugees.

100
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,559
On top of that,

101
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,309
North Korea serves as a barrier between China
and the US military bases in South Korea.

102
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:33,319
So it makes sense that China is not actually
that upset by its little brother setting off

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,120
the world's most dangerous firecrackers.

104
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,260
And that's why North Korea knows that it can
do pretty much whatever it wants.

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
China isn't going to do anything to rock the
boat.

106
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,200
Unfortunately for the rest of the planet,

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,880
there's not much we can do unless China is
willing to tighten the screws on North Korea.

108
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,159
North Korea is already the most heavily sanctioned
country on earth.

109
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,759
The only support they're really getting is
from China.

110
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,249
And since there are a million North Korean
troops, loads of artillery, and a promise

111
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:08,749
to turn South Korea's capital Seoul into "a
sea of flames" should an invasion happen,

112
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:11,569
a Western military strike might be hard to
carry out.

113
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,020
So what is the solution?

114
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,580
Yeah we're all doomed.

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,740
Well, what do you think can be done?

116
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,580

Once again I'm Chris Chappell.

119
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:27,349
See you next time.

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,220
Hopefully.
