1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:04,230
US Taxpayers are the biggest funder

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,789
of the World Health Organization

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,490
But it’s rife with corruption

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,400
And it’s done some sketchy things

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,600
When it comes to China’s coronavirus outbreak

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,880
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,240
When the world is threatened by an outbreak

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,110
of a deadly coronavirus from China,

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,710
who you gonna call....

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,750
No, WHO. The World Health Organization.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,120
I can see how that could be confusing.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,250
Let’s just stick with “W.H.O.”

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,129
And I can see how the W.H.O.’s response
to the coronavirus

15
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,670
could also be confusing,

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,430
because it’s hard to understand how

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,370
the main global organization charged with
handling it

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,410
could have screwed up so badly.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,270
The World Health Organization is a United
Nations body

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,469
concerned with world health.

21
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,000
At least supposedly.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,150
But it turns out,

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,620
corruption in the agency is putting lives
at risk.

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,440
By now it’s a recognized fact the Chinese
Commuinst Party

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,050
has used a two step solution to deal with
the coronavirus.

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,480
Step One—cover it up.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,580
They arrested whistleblowing doctors and journalists.

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,580
And state-run media

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,070
either kept numbers of infections impossibly
low,

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,650
or didn’t report on it at all.

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,420
But after weeks of coverup

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,900
allowed the virus to spread across China

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,920
and around the world,

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,160
it became too big to cover up.

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,460
So then, step two: authoritarian crackdown!

36
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,040
The Chinese regime has quarantined much of
Hubei province,

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,480
where the outbreak began.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,580
It’s the largest quarantine in human history,

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,230
with tens of millions of people affected.

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,750
And now much of the rest of the country is
under lockdown as well.

41
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,090
Now you might be thinking,

42
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,660
a quarantine makes sense right?

43
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,710
Except on this ginormous scale,

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,430
it doesn’t actually work well.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,380
It’s been authoritarian,

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,380
heavy handed,

47
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,250
and often arbitrary—

48
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,350
varying from one village or city to another.

49
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,750
And this has made Chinese people lose trust
in their government.

50
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,910
Some people look for ways to escape the quarantine
zones.

51
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,350
And many don’t report to authorities when
they get sick,

52
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,400
because the consequences could include

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,610
being put in a quarantine center

54
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,190
next to hundreds of other sick people.

55
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,120
In some cases people have said that the quarantine
centers

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,770
don’t have enough medical staff or even
food.

57
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,100
According to an expert at the University of
Edinburgh,

58
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,190
“The way Chinese authorities have gone about
it is quite dangerous

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,780
because you actually start to erode that trust
in the government.

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,170
You want citizens coming forward and saying:

61
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,010
I feel unwell.”

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,170
The Chinese Communist Party is getting slammed

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,960
with international criticism

64
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,880
for how they handled the coronavirus.

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,730
But guess who hasn’t been criticizing them?

66
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,190
The World Health Organization.

67
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,970
In fact, the W.H.O. has been praising

68
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,140
how the Communist Party has handled it.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,640
This is the director general of the W.H.O.,
Tedros Adhanom,

70
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,370
meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping three
weeks ago.

71
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,720
At the time, Tedros said,

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,010
“We appreciate the seriousness

73
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,260
with which China is taking this outbreak,

74
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,680
especially the commitment from top leadership,

75
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,780
and the transparency they have demonstrated.”

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,790
He also said,

77
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,770
“China is actually setting a new standard
for outbreak response.”

78
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,620
Hmmm... Detaining activists who criticize
Xi Jinping?

79
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,459
Technically, that is a new standard for outbreak
response.

80
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,640
Anyway, Tedros lavished praise on China,

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,400
despite the fact that “it took nearly two
weeks for the agency t

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,340
o get a go-ahead from China to send even an
advance team,

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,670
which arrived in Beijing on February 10,

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,360
to discuss a joint mission.”

85
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,790
Tedros’s praise of China has been so lavish,

86
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,670
he’s been featured repeatedly in Chinese
state-run media,

87
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,020
like this video from the People’s Daily.

88
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,330
China took actions massively at the epicenter,

89
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,430
at the source of the outbreak.

90
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,320
This is heroic.

91
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,260
The actions of China are making us safer.

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,500
Maybe it’s just me,

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,800
but I don’t feel a whole lot safer.

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,410
And, keep in mind,

95
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,730
Tedros was praising China’s authoritarian
response to the virus

96
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,820
at the same time he was criticizing other
countries,

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,950
especially the US,

98
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,720
for travel bans to and from China.

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,650
"There is no reason for measures

100
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,940
that unnecessarily interfere with international
travel and trade.

101
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,470
We call on all countries to implement decisions

102
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,350
that are evidence-based and consistent."

103
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,430
Good thing no one listened to him.

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,120
Major world airports set up screening procedures

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,500
for travelers who had recently been to China.

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,730
Many airlines simply stopped flights to and
from China.

107
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,370
You know, it’s not a great thing

108
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,040
when people ignore the main global organization

109
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,460
that’s meant to advise everyone on health
crises.

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,500
Tedros also said in an interview

111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,940
that the quarantine of tens of millions of
people in China

112
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,730
is consistent with the WHO’s regulations

113
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,490
that call for “the least intrusive measures
possible

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,260
and strong protection for freedom of movement

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,340
and other human rights.”

116
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,889
Least intrusive?

117
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,610
I would hate to see what the W.H.O. actually
considers intrusive.

118
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,800
Incidentally, Tedros was a leader

119
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,180
in Ethiopia’s Tigray People’s Liberation
Front.

120
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,460
That’s “a wing of the ruling Marxist-rooted

121
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,300
Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic
Front.

122
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,610
He served the violently repressive regime

123
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,040
as minister of foreign affairs

124
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,760
from 2012 to 2016,

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,040
after a stint as health minister.”

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,410
So I would really hate to see what Tedros
considers intrusive.

127
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,410
Though he did say,

128
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,610
“I think that human rights and so on should
be respected.”

129
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,620
Yeah, human rights and so on, yada yada yada.

130
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,270
But Tedros isn’t the only one in the W.H.O.

131
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,370
who’s praising the Chinese Communist Party’s

132
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,310
response to the coronavirus.

133
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,390
Another W.H.O. representative recently told
a panel,

134
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,930
“The people of China feel protected...

135
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,190
We all need to take a step back and admire
what’s happened.”

136
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,440
Remember Peter Humphrey,

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,040
the British private investigator

138
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,610
who was jailed in China in 2013?

139
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,880
“He had been drugged,

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,949
chained to a chair,

141
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,150
locked in a cage

142
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,449
and then made to read out a statement written
by the police

143
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,150
in front of the cameras.

144
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,000
The anchor who presented the footage, James
Chau,

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is now a goodwill ambassador with the World
Health Organization.”

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,680
This kind of praise for China has been going
on for years.

147
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,190
This statement from former W.H.O. Director
General Margaret Chan

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,820
says “In the eyes of the world,

149
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,970
China is increasingly seen as a model

150
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,380
for development at many levels.”

151
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,440
China has lifted, “millions of its people
out of poverty.”

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,440
And “China is extremely fortunate to have
a President

153
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,590
who has made health the centre of all government
policies.”

154
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,190
And if the people don’t want to be healthy,

155
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,380
sometimes you just have to force them.

156
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,580
Incidentally, “Beijing backed the appointment
of Margaret Chan,

157
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,210
a former director of health in Hong Kong,

158
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,210
as WHO director-general from 2006 to 2017.”

159
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,520
But beyond just praise,

160
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,970
the Chinese regime seems incredibly successful
at

161
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,070
getting the W.H.O. to bow down to its claims
over Taiwan.

162
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,880
In case you don’t know,

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,169
Taiwan is a sovereign country

164
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,970
with its own government, military, and currency.

165
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,289
But the Chinese regime considers it part of
China.

166
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,370
And China has used its influence in the W.H.O.
to keep Taiwan out.

167
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,250
Here’s a speech given at a W.H.O. meeting
last year.

168
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,710
“There is simply no principled basis why
Taiwan should not be here …

169
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,340
The only reason that it is not here now

170
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,320
is because the government in Beijing

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,900
does not like the current government in Taiwan.”

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,080
And yet Taiwan is not allowed to join

173
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,570
the World Health Organization as a member
state.

174
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,000
Or even as an observer.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,050
And that puts Taiwan’s population of 23
million people at risk.

176
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,099
“Taiwan’s exclusion from the W.H.O.

177
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,350
leaves its population vulnerable during this
crisis—

178
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,230
a lack of direct and timely channels to the
W.H.O.

179
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,350
have already resulted in inaccurate reporting
of cases in Taiwan.”

180
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,650
Taiwan has repeatedly complained that China
and the W.H.O.

181
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,119
aren’t sharing information about the coronavirus
outbreak with them.

182
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:04,399
That’s also what happened back in 2003

183
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,889
when the deadly SARS epidemic broke out in
China.

184
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,459
Besides putting 23 million Taiwanese lives
at risk,

185
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,679
that also affects the 50 million foreign travelers

186
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,949
who pass through Taiwan’s airports every
year.

187
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,129
They might assume the W.H.O. is taking care
of things.

188
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,179
They would be wrong.

189
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:30,679
In fact, the W.H.O. can’t even figure out
what to call Taiwan.

190
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,180
Last month a W.H.O. spokesman called it China,
Taiwan.

191
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,679
And then “a February 4 report flipped it
and listed ‘Taiwan, China,’

192
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,490
but got the number of cases wrong,

193
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,769
relying on data from Beijing not Taipei.”

194
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,279
Now the W.H.O. don’t even mention Taiwan.

195
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,920
They recently called it “Taipei and environs”

196
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,619
in a list of affected cities in China.

197
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:59,069
Why does China have this kind of influence

198
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:02,070
over the World Health Organization?

199
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,790
It turns out, the W.H.O. is horribly corrupt.

200
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,329
An audit revealed

201
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,179
“There has been a surge in internal corruption
allegations

202
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,019
across the whole of the organisation,

203
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,300
with the detection of multiple schemes

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,790
aimed at defrauding large sums of money

205
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,740
from the international body.”

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,640
That included, an “upsurge of internal complaints
of corruption,

207
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,350
fraud and even sexual harassment

208
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,939
from across the 7,000-strong organisation,

209
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,629
overwhelming an internal team

210
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:37,899
of four full-time investigators and two consultants.”

211
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,649
And yet, the division of the W.H.O.

212
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,529
responsible for handling the coronavirus outbreak,

213
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:48,679
“is so chronically underfunded it has repeatedly
been found to pose

214
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,189
a "severe" and "unacceptable" level of hazard.”

215
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,180
Great! So some people in the W.H.O.

216
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,130
are scamming loads of money and getting rich,

217
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,209
while the coronavirus team is way underfunded.

218
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,679
Maybe that’s why the W.H.O. delayed issuing

219
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,149
a global emergency over the coronavirus—

220
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,980
even though human to human transmission

221
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,480
had already been confirmed.

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,199
Or maybe it’s because of China’s role
as a donor to the W.H.O.

223
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,059
After this 2017 meeting between Tedros

224
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,139
and high-level Chinese leaders,

225
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,600
the W.H.O got a big\h new financial contribution
from China.

226
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,139
China also wants to build an 80 million dollar
headquarters

227
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,199
for the Africa Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.

228
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,470
Guess where they want to build it?

229
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,339
In Ethiopia!

230
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:45,769
Wow, what a coincidence that that’s Tedros’
home country!

231
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,420
The US is pretty sure it will be used for
spying.

232
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,410
But “China’s importance to the WHO

233
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,040
derives not so much as a current donor

234
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,059
but as a future source of funds and a partner

235
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,160
with which to tackle the biggest global health
problems.”

236
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,749
Well, China’s got the money.

237
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:04,379
And 20% of the world’s population.

238
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,209
But is the ruling Communist Party really a
good

239
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,319
“partner with which to tackle the biggest
global health problems?”

240
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:14,679
A lot of health experts are furious at the
W.H.O.

241
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,930
for their praise of China’s response to
the coronavirus,

242
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,740
and their delay in issuing a global emergency.

243
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,920
According to Lawrence Gostin,

244
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,269
a professor of global health law at Georgetown
University

245
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,850
who also provides technical assistance to
the WHO,

246
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,869
“We were deceived...

247
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,110
Myself and other public health experts,

248
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,600
based on what the World Health Organization
and China were saying,

249
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,369
reassured the public that this was not serious,

250
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:43,869
that we could bring this under control.”

251
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:47,230
Allegations of corruption in the W.H.O. are
nothing new.

252
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,089
In 2017, this exposé from the Associated
Press

253
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,040
found that nearly half of the W.H.O.’s 2
billion dollar budget

254
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,320
went to first-class airfare and five-star
hotels.

255
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,300
The United States is the largest contributor:

256
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,550
US taxpayers fund about quarter of the W.H.O.’s
budget.

257
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,009
And get this—

258
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,629
that “doesn’t include costs often covered

259
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,629
by host countries seeking to curry favor,

260
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,709
which are off W.H.O.’s books.”

261
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,309
And if you know anything about the Chinese
Communist Party

262
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,160
and how they buy influence,

263
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
it’s often by spending on lavish trips.

264
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,410
Now there’s no evidence that’s what happened
with the W.H.O.

265
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,319
I’m just a bit concerned,

266
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:35,489
you know, what with all the corruption and
boot licking.

267
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,779
Especially because the W.H.O. relies on

268
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,449
the “funding and the cooperation of members
to function,

269
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,050
giving wealthy member states like China considerable
influence.”

270
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,559
So I know right now you’re probably

271
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,239
pretty worried about getting accurate information

272
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,910
about the coronavirus outbreak.

273
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,089
Fear not!

274
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,519
“[The] WHO is also battling misinformation,

275
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,519
working with Google to ensure that people
get facts

276
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,049
from the U.N. health agency first

277
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,829
when they search for information about the
virus.”

278
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,459
And that’s why below this video on YouTube—

279
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,709
a platform owned by Google—

280
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,319
you’ll see a link to the W.H.O.,

281
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,779
the most trustworthy source of coronavirus
information.

282
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,130
They put it there automatically.

283
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,540
I can’t remove it.

284
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,809
Of course, if that’s not enough

285
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,089
to point your opinion in the “correct”
direction,

286
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,989
YouTube has also demonetized almost every
video

287
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,079
I and everyone else on YouTube

288
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,209
has published about the coronavirus.

289
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,939
You know, to discourage us all

290
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:43,649
from even talking about it outside the official
channels.

291
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,689
But what Google, YouTube, the WHO, and China

292
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,049
didn’t count on was the amazing support

293
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,709
of what I call the China Uncensored 50-cent
army.

294
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,579
They’re fans of the show who contribute

295
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,610
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

296
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,249
Because of their financial support,

297
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,970
I can make an episode about how China,

298
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,550
the W.H.O., and Google

299
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,459
don’t have your best interests at heart

300
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,089
when it comes to the coronavirus outbreak.

301
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,079
They can demonetize China Uncensored all they
want,

302
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,929
and I’ll just keep making episodes anyway.

303
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,179
So as a thank you to members

304
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,220
of the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army,

305
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,720
I answer questions from them at the end of
some of my episodes.

306
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,339
Today’s question comes from Tony Chopkoski.

307
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,610
He asks, “Tedros...Tedros?

308
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,819
Really on the ball?

309
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,759
China has huge investments in Ethiopia,

310
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,189
where he hails from.

311
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,059
And their airline is still flying to China.

312
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,019
It makes Kenya, next door, very afraid.”

313
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,899
You know, I never even thought about that.

314
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,649
But it turns out that yes,

315
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,459
China is investing heavily in Ethiopia.

316
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:55,839
And since Chinese investment is called debt
trap diplomacy,

317
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,549
it should come as no surprise that about half
of all Ethiopia’s debt

318
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,000
belongs to China.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,459
“The largest part of the debt was for

320
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,839
the construction of the $4bn Ethiopia-Djibouti
railway.

321
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,560
The Export-Import Bank of China

322
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,790
backed the project with $3.3bn in loans.

323
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,269
The railway has so far been crippled by light
loads,

324
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,989
electricity shortages and disruptions due
to protests.”

325
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,199
But hey, it connects Ethiopia

326
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,929
to China’s first overseas military base
in Djibouti,

327
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,339
so that’s worth it, right?

328
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,509
Chinese investment in Africa

329
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,339
has been called a new colonialism.

330
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,529
Could Chinese investment in Ethiopia

331
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,829
affect Tedros’ decision making

332
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,100
as Director in Chief of the WHO?

333
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,180
Obviously I can’t say for sure.

334
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,109
But let’s just say I feel extra comforted
by the W.H.O. link

335
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,059
YouTube is putting below this video.

336
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,669
Take it away, Tedros.

337
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,769
The actions of China are making us safer.

338
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,839
Thanks for your question, Tony.

339
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,319
And thank you for watching.

340
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,619
Please be sure to subscribe to China Uncensored,

341
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,040
I’ve been hearing from a lot of subscribers

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,360
YouTube has unsubscribed them,

343
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,060
so yeah, make sure you’re subscribed,

344
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,300
turn that notification bell icon on

345
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,440
so you get notified when we have new episodes,

346
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,710
and please, help share these videos.

347
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,050
I’m sure the WHO and the Chinese Communist
Party

348
