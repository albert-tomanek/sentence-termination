1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,760
That’s no moon...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,560
It’s a Chinese-Russian Moon base

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,680
And it could determine the future of space

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,240
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,120
There’s a new space force in orbit. And\h
this one is being led by China and Russia.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,880
But first, Youtube frequently\h
demonetizes the show. If you can,\h\h

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,360
help support our work for as little as a dollar\h
an episode on Patreon.com/chinauncensored.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,920
And be sure to hit those\h
like and subscribe buttons,\h\h

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
so the almighty YouTube\h
algorithm may smile upon us.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
So as I said, Russia and China are teaming\h
up. This time—to build a moon base.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,000
That’s one small step for man, one\h
giant leap—into a dystopian future.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,880
I’m kidding of course. The Russia-China\h
moon base is for “peaceful purposes\h\h

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,480
in the interests of all mankind”.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
That’s according to this joint\h
statement from China and Russia.\h

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,360
And just when the world needed\h
him most, Elon Musk vanished.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,960
“The two countries have also signed\h
agreements to jointly create a data center\h\h

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,760
for the exploration of the moon and deep space.”

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
The base will be built on the lunar south pole.\h\h

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,840
That’s because scientists believe there might\h
be a lot of ice there. And ice could serve as\h\h

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
a water supply. There also might be an\h
orbital part of the moon base as well.\h

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,480
The base will be called the\h
“International Lunar Science Station.”\h\h

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,760
International, because China and Russia\h
want to lure the rest of the world in,\h\h

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
so they can replace the US\h
as the dominant space force.\h

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,160
It’s a real possibility too. “The\h
European Space Agency has also expressed\h\h

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,320
interest in partnering with China\h
on future missions to the Moon.”

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,920
As early as last year, China\h
was talking about a Moon base.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,400
And in 2019, China was the first country to\h
land a probe on the dark side of the moon.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,160
Unfortunately, the probe was\h
quickly refracted into a rainbow.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
NASA has excluded China from\h
all US space operations.\h\h

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,680
That’s because China’s space program is run\h
by the Chinese Communist Party’s military.\h\h

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,160
Although now Biden’s space advisers are\h
saying we should cooperate with China.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
They are officially space cadets.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
US dominance of space has\h
been slipping for decades.\h\h

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
And Russia and China are eager to replace the US.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
Not only would that have a huge\h
impact on future space explorations,\h\h

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,080
but also on security here on Earth.\h

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,880
China is already trying to replace the\h
GPS navigation system, which is run\h\h

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,560
by the US. And they’ve launched\h
their own satellites to do it.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
So whoever controls space\h
will be the next superpower.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
The Biden Administration has said it will\h\h

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,080
continue the Trump era Artemis\h
Program to return to the moon.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,600
Former Vice President Mike Pence had said\h
the US would return to the Moon by 2024.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,280
To get there, NASA created the Artemis\h
Program in 2017, and it laid the\h\h

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,200
groundwork for international cooperation in\h
space—international cooperation with the US.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,920
NASA also created the Artemis Accords in\h
2020, and they’ve been signed by 10 countries.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,280
The Accords say that “Partner nations...need\h
to agree to 10 basic norms as part of\h\h

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,040
their space activities, such as operating\h
transparently and releasing scientific data.”

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
Those are things that China and\h
Russia maybe aren’t too keen on,\h\h

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,440
being authoritarian regimes and all.\h
And, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but\h\h

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
I really agree with state-run Global\h
Times on this one, when they say Russia\h\h

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,000
opting for moon base cooperation with\h
China over the US is ‘not surprising’

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,040
And now, as a thank you to everyone who\h
supports China Uncensored on Patreon,\h\h

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,880
I’ll answer a question from what I call\h
the China Uncensored 50 cent army.\h

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,880
P Dwag asks, “Doesn't the CCP already\h
control the value of the RMB within\h\h

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,040
China? They are just re-inventing\h
bank accounts and debit cards.”

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
This was in response to our recent episode\h
about China declaring war on Bitcoin.\h\h

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Essentially, the Chinese Comunist Party is trying\h
to create its own national digital currency.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
P Dwag, you’re right that China\h
already controls the value of the RMB.\h\h

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
But that’s not enough for the Communist\h
Party. Over the past several years,\h\h

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
China has been transitioning\h
to becoming a cashless society.

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,840
That gives the government way more power\h
to monitor and track every transaction\h\h

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
Chinese people make. It also let’s\h
them freeze the accounts of dissidents.

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Sure, there are tools to do most of\h
that already, but it involves piecing\h\h

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,680
together a lot of different systems, including\h
coordinating with different Chinese companies.\h\h

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
But with a digital currency, it’s so much easier.

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,400
Globally, however, the US dollar still dominates.\h
In fact, a lot of China’s Belt and Road agreements\h\h

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,760
operate using the dollar. China wants to have\h
the dominant global currency. The RMB is unlikely\h\h

68
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,280
to do that. But countries around the world are\h
experimenting with a national digital currency.\h\h

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,280
“Yet no major power is as far along as China. Its\h
early moves could signal where the rest of the\h\h

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
world goes with digital currencies.”
\h\h

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,920
So China’s ambition is much greater\h
than just controlling the RMB.\h\h

72
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,480
And if that terrifies you, now’s a\h
good time to remind you that China\h\h

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,000
Uncensored also accepts bitcoin.\h

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Thanks for your question P Dwag.

75
