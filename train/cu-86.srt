00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,340
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,120
China’s next financial crisis is lurking
in the shadows...

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,580
of shadow banking.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,840
It’s like China stacked up 9 trillion dollars...

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,120
on the edge of a cliff.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,050
I’m Matt Gnaizda.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,740
I’m in today for Chris Chappell,

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,970
who’s on vacation,

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,690
possibly in the South China Sea.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,710
Today, we’re going to talk about shadow
banking.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,310
It’s like the evil twin of regular banking.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,630
Shadow banking involves lots of money,

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,979
and lots of risk.

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,860
And it’s tied to China’s crazy investment
boom.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,420
China’s economic boom

17
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,440
and its reliance on shadow banking

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,589
is similar in some ways

19
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,659
to the US economic boom in 2007.

20
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,659
Remember:

21
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,139
A lot of great things happened in 2007.

22
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:50,789
Apple released the iPhone 1.

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,909
The last Harry Potter book was published...

24
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,840
which Chris still has not read.

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,300
And the US economy had its last...good...year.

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,199
Because then this happened.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,239
“Stocks all around the world are
tanking

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,040
because of the crisis on Wall Street.”

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,460
“The stock market is now down 21%”

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,760
“We have armageddon.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,330
In the fixed income markets we have armageddon.”

32
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:13,820
“No, but...”

33
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,240
“We have armageddon.”

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,420
“Armageddon”—thanks Jim Cramer—

35
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,640
happened after the failure

36
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,290
of a single investment bank had a domino effect

37
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,500
on the entire global financial system.

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,890
Trillions of dollars were lost,

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,310
and so were millions of jobs.

40
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,230
Well, it’s been ten years since then.

41
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,480
These guys have recovered,

42
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,730
but these guys...not so much.

43
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,000
But now, this same kind of

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,980
boom and crash could happen in China—

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,000
and for the same reason.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,640
As Bloomberg puts it,

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,800
China is playing a 9 trillion dollar game
of chicken

48
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,110
called Shadow Banking.

49
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,650
And like a game of chicken,

50
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,720
some investors will get out in time.

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,620
But others will plunge off the cliff,

52
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,750
bursting into a ball of flames on the rocks
below.

53
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,320
So what is this totally legit

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,120
and trustworthy sounding “shadow banking”?

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,300
To put it simply,

56
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,820
shadow banking is when banks—

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,470
or companies that are not banks—

58
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,109
lend money outside of the normal structure

59
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:11,750
of bank deposits and loans.

60
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,790
Here’s a simplified explanation.

61
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,319
In the traditional banking system,

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,430
if a business owner wants to grow his business,

63
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,719
he goes to a bank,
and that bank loans him money.

64
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,719
Over time,

65
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,829
he repays that money to the bank,

66
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,849
plus interest.

67
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,780
Let’s say a single bank makes 100 loans.

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,599
It’s pretty careful about who it loans to.

69
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,599
But even so,

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,239
some of the businesses will fail,

71
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,029
so Chinese regulations require

72
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,790
that the bank set aside money

73
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,459
to cover potential losses.

74
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,790
But shadow banking operates

75
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,739
outside that traditional system.

76
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,120
Let’s say 100 businesses want loans.

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,230
A shadow bank packages those 100 potential
loans

78
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,250
into what’s called a Wealth Management Product.

79
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,129
Then it goes to investors and is like,

80
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,209
“Hey, buy our Wealth Management Product.

81
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,939
It has a high interest rate.”

82
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,760
When the businesses repay,

83
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,669
the investors will get their investment back

84
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,400
plus a lot of interest.

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,209
This is shadow banking.

86
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,370
It can also get more complicated.

87
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,560
Because sometimes the bank isn’t a bank,

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,769
but just a regular company

89
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,959
that packages investments.

90
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,249
And sometimes the businesses

91
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,249
that want to borrow money

92
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,750
aren’t regular businesses.

93
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,769
They might even be a local government

94
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,599
that wants money to build a bridge or whatever.

95
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,109
All these things can be packaged

96
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,849
into Wealth Management Products,

97
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,980
or other types of financial products,

98
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,980
and then sold to investors—

99
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,659
or sold to investment companies,

100
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,099
which then re-package them

101
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,489
before selling to individual investors.

102
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,569
A lot of times,

103
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,419
shadow bank loans get so complicated

104
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,480
that no one understands

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,639
exactly what the risk is.

106
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,110
According to this article,

107
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,840
“The repackaging of credit is so complex

108
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,579
that bankers often have to resort to

109
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,860
line drawings that look like schematic plans

110
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,739
for a Rube Goldberg device

111
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,559
to explain to clients what's going on.”

112
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,120
A Rube Goldberg device.

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,189
Like when you pull a lever,

114
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,919
that sets a wheel in motion,

115
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,309
that knocks down some dominoes,

116
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,700
that ends up destroying the economy.

117
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,939
But all this shadow banking

118
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,629
and Wealth Management whatevers

119
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,109
are so complicated!

120
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,700
Investors don’t want to know details!

121
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,719
That’s why companies involved in shadow
banking

122
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,180
put out feel-good ads like this:

123
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,840
“Everyone holds sunshine at their hearts

124
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,900
Everbright your life

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,060
China Everbright Bank”

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,500
See?

127
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,690
Give us your money,

128
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,440
and you’ll have sunshine in your heart!

129
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
That bank, Everbright,

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,730
is actually a legit commercial bank.

131
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,590
It makes regular loans, too.

132
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,190
But recently it’s also been selling

133
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,170
a lot of shadow banking products to investors,

134
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,380
because that allows Everbright

135
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,260
to maximize profit without putting

136
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,690
so much of its own money on the line.

137
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,670
Basically, it sells the risk to investors.

138
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,080
But a lot of Chinese investors

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,370
don’t think risk matters that much,

140
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,820
because the Chinese government will probably

141
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,810
bail everyone out if things go badly.

142
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,630
Like this investor in this Bloomberg article,

143
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,350
who explains that the Chinese government

144
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,460
would never let a big wealth management product
fail,

145
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,810
because it’s just not Chinese culture.

146
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,650
Sounds like wishful thinking, right?

147
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,990
But the Chinese government has

148
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,120
bailed out banks in the past.

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,170
Like the $45 billion dollar bailout in 2004.

150
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,980
So assuming they’ll do it again seems reasonable.

151
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,440
Although if you’ve ever read the terms and
conditions

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,470
on any investment product ever,

153
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,150
you’ve seen that “past performance

154
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,430
is no guarantee of future results.”

155
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,800
Sure, the Chinese government may have done

156
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,640
a small 45 billion dollar bailout in the past.

157
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,390
But it doesn’t want to do a 9 trillion dollar
bailout now.

158
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,640
Besides, back then,

159
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,420
there was almost no shadow banking in China.

160
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,560
It only started happening on a large scale

161
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,160
after the global financial crisis ten years
ago.

162
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,970
Authorities tried to stimulate China’s economy

163
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,780
by having banks lend more money.

164
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,250
But soon, demand for borrowing got so high

165
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,190
that banks didn’t have enough money to lend
people.

166
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,990
So banks started packaging loans

167
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,390
and selling them to investors to get the cash.

168
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,410
And it became such a big market,

169
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,870
other companies that aren’t even banks

170
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,270
got into the game.

171
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,970
According to a 2016 report,

172
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,120
shadow bank loans now make up

173
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,160
57 percent all loans in China.

174
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
In other words,

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,360
more than half of all lending in China now

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,090
is actually done through shadow banking!

177
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,340
And this is a big problem

178
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,250
because shadow bank loans are usually

179
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,890
a lot riskier than traditional loans.

180
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,940
Once companies start packaging and repackaging,

181
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,150
it’s easy to lose track of what the risk
actually is.

182
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,250
It even starts to seem like a good idea,

183
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,210
like jumping out of a plane without a parachute.

184
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,210
The problem is,

185
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,560
it only works if you’re you’re Keanu Reeves,
dude.

186
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,250
Oh, and there’s another problem.

187
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Shadow banking loans don’t get recorded

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,990
on banks’ balance sheets.

189
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,990
That makes banks look

190
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,930
healthier than they actually are—

191
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,270
and that also increases the risk.

192
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
And guess what?

193
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,800
That’s exactly what happened in the US

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,740
leading up to the 2007 crisis.

195
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Banks had been packaging

196
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,800
and repackaging home loans,

197
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,310
then selling and reselling the packages,

198
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,060
and eventually even the nerds at Lehman Brothers

199
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,170
had no idea how to calculate the risk anymore.

200
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,740
Shadow banking in the US was the lever

201
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,390
that set the global financial crisis in motion,

202
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,870
and ironically, its domino effect

203
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,110
is what led to the rise of

204
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,710
shadow banking in China.

205
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,820
And now Chinese authorities are getting worried

206
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,930
about what’s coming next.

207
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,930
In fact,

208
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,460
“Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China’s central
bank

209
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,050
has openly warned that authorities

210
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,970
need to curb financial risks

211
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,390
that might lead to a ‘Minsky Moment’—

212
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,650
a sudden collapse of asset prices,

213
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,400
sparked by debt or currency pressures,

214
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
after a long period of growth.”

215
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Basically, bad debt in shadow banking

216
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,800
could end up wrecking the Chinese economy.

217
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,570
And if the Chinese economy gets wrecked,

218
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,500
it could lead to serious consequences

219
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,960
for the Chinese Communist Party.

220
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,130
You know, because no one

221
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,750
believes in that communism stuff anymore,

222
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,440
so they tell people to go make money

223
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,610
and don’t talk about politics.

224
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,950
But if people start losing their money

225
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,460
on a massive scale,

226
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,600
people might start talking about politics
again—

227
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,980
like who’s to blame.

228
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,010
That’s why, at a top level conference in
July,

229
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,430
Xi Jinping declared that financial security

230
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,870
was vital to national security.

231
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,920
“National security” is of course code
for the CCP

232
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,670
securing its power over the nation.

233
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,900
But it’s not 2007 anymore.

234
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,520
It’s 2018.

235
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,150
We have iPhone 10s,

236
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,630
Johnny Depp is a Harry Potter villain,

237
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,419
and Chinese shadow banking has swelled

238
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,590
to more than $9 trillion.

239
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,380
The Chinese government can’t afford

240
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,510
to bail everyone out

241
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,920
when things go south.

242
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,500
They’re trying to rein in shadow banking.

243
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,620
But once you let the tiger out of the cage,

244
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
well, it...

245
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,620
I guess it runs around and eats people.

246
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,930
So what do you think of China’s shadow banking?

247
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,430
Leave your comments below.

248
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,140
Once again I’m Matt Gnaizda.

249
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,520
Now it’s time for that thing we do at the
end.

250
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,780
You’re still here?

251
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,500
Good.

252
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,120
Don’t worry,

253
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,500
I haven’t taken over China Uncensored.

254
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,020
Chris will be back soon.

255
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,080

256
