1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
He's got the beard, I've got the bulk...

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,720
Wow! That's... that's a slogan there.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's make lots of money!

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,300
That's a poster with you two and:

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,460
'He's got the beard. He's got the bulk.
Together, they are...'

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,740
Bulkbeard!

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,660
There we go.
[Laughter]

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,140
That sounds like the next Marvel one.
Bulkbeard!

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,980
I just think it's a really fat pirate.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,400
[Laughter]

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,780
Discount men's grooming warehouse.

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,340
[Pirate voice]
'No, you go board it. I... I can't move.'

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,500
He's just flopped in a big chaise longue on the poop deck.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,340
'Arr. Bring back any snacks they may have.'

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,920
Sorry, it's getting close to a Wogan pirate.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,240
Little bit. Little bit.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,000
[Wogan impression] 'Bring back any snacks they may have.'

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,820
Must Wogan all impressions!

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,540
No, no, no, it's not like anyone will mistake that. I've been doing a lot of Woganing.

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,280
'Bring back any biscuits!.'

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,200
'Or sausages. Or any cream horns.'

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,240
— This is just Wogan.
— It's not!
