00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,810
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,100
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,690
Well, it's that time of year again.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,020
When June 3 transitions peacefully to June
5

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,240
with absolutely nothing happening in between.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,110
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,170
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you…

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,480
What’s that Shelley?

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,330
Oh my...no! No!

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,000
You’re joking right?!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,160
I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,700
but it turns out there is a June 4,

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,960
and it marks the day the Chinese Communist
Party went too far!

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,080
They blocked Tumblr.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,960
I know right?!

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,010
Somehow Tumblr managed to be one of the only
foreign social media platforms

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,309
not blocked in China—until now.

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,070
How will Chinese people know how high Xi Jinping's
pants are now?

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,580
The social media revolution now depends on
you, Friendster.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,851
Shoot.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,500
This was of course in the lead-up to the 27
year anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre,

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,900
or as many young Mainland Chinese refer to
it,

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,400
“who cares?”

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
It’s a time when you can be arrested for
dangerous and subversive acts,

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,780
like remembering.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,960
Of course, outside Mainland China,

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,010
there is no state-mandated amnesia.

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,299
From New York to Hong Kong,

29
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,590
tens of thousands of people marked the anniversary.

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,530
And in a move that will surely only improve
Cross-Straits Relations,

31
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,909
Taiwan’s new president had a message for
China’s leadership on Facebook.

32
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,530
“There’s nothing scary about democracy.
Democracy is a good and fine thing.”

33
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,630
And while you might expect that to result
in more accusations from Chinese officials

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,299
that Tsai is just a crazy unbalanced woman,

35
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,820
it probably won’t.

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,750
After all, she wrote this on Facebook,

37
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,880
so how will they ever read it in China?

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,460
Unless, Chinese state-run media with Facebook
accounts tell them.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,340
But now that June 4 has passed,

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,780
we can all breathe a sigh of relief and get
on with our lives,

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,640
happily avoiding getting political.

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,580
At least, for 6 weeks

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,450
when the next sensitive anniversary comes
up.

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,910
July 20 1999, when the Chinese regime began
doing this to people

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,910
for doing this.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,400
So what’s your favorite way to forget June
4?

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,650

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,100
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
