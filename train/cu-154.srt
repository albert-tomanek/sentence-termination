1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,800
A Chinese police reality TV show is a hit

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,830
And now posing as an arrested criminal

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:16,299
Is the latest viral trend 
in China

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,529
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:18,529
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,670
China is spending more on policing its own
people than on its defense budget.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,199
Now, you might think: Oh my gosh, that sounds
like an Orwellian nightmare.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,420
Well, allow me to re-educate you.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,649
Let’s say you’re caught not wearing a
mask during Covid.

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:40,789
China’s police are there to assist you...for
the greater good.

11
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:43,809
What if you’re riding an unlicensed scooter?

12
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:50,559
The police are there to teach you and your
child that violating the rules is dangerous.

13
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,559
Here, China’s police are helping a poor
delivery guy who can’t walk.

14
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,440
He needs help getting to his next delivery
because the police took his scooter.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,189
This video appears to show city management
officers--the notorious chengguan--stealing

16
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,090
cooking oil from a small business.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,890
But really, they’re just doing it to grease
the wheels of the people’s government.

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,939
Sure, it looks like these city management
officers are stealing farmers’ vegetables

19
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:21,939
at the market.

20
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,530
But you’ve got to keep the officers healthy!

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,509
And this city management officer may look
like he’s just randomly smashing people’s

22
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,190
stuff with a sledgehammer...but, what, are
you going to waste a good sledgehammer by

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,010
not using it?

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,619
All this is to say, there’s some conflict
in China—where a lot of people don’t realize

25
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,630
how heroic their law enforcement officers
are.

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,219
And it's important everybody knows this.

27
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,439
Simply writing negative comments about the
police on social media, like "these police

28
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,890
are not a good thing...Lol", can get you in
trouble.

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,540
The guy was detained for 7 days.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,080
See, “When information goes up online of
state agents behaving poorly, it makes the

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,470
state a little more vulnerable.

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,400
This violates public expectations about how
the police or other state agents should act.”

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,830
The problem is, there are just way too many
videos of violent Chinese police making their

34
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,760
way around the internet and social media—more
than China’s massive censorship apparatus

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,100
can deal with.

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,569
“Listen to me.

37
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,950
The police are the nation’s weapon of violence!”

38
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,200
So what’s the Chinese Communist Party to
do to counter these negative perceptions?

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,230
Well “Many police stations have a social
media account on WeChat or Weibo and aim to

40
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,830
present a more positive, friendly image of
the police.”

41
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,900
And when that’s not enough, “The ministry
[of Public Security] also teamed up with CCTV

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,310
to produce television content.”

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,790
Which brings me to “Guardians of Jiefangxi.”

44
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:15,250
It’sa hit reality TV show about the daily
life of police who operate on Jiefangxi Road,

45
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,870
in a district of Changsha.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,209
Changsha is a mid-size city in Southern China,
roughly the size of New York City, but way

47
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,989
less interesting.

48
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,319
Guardians of Jiefangxi is like the show COPS.

49
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,269
But instead of showing the heated rush of
a police crackdown in Florida,

50
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,810
it follows the daily life of China’s heroic
police officers.

51
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,769
“Special police forces, fighting terrorism
and preventing violence.

52
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:48,260
Dealing with unexpected circumstances, and
capturing criminals.”

53
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,420
Now there’s actually not that much street
crime in China.

54
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,069
Unless you count this...or this—which you
should not.

55
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,281
But ordinary people can’t really get away
with street crime anymore—thanks to the

56
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:09,760
massive surveillance system that the show
constantly reminds people of.

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,140
So this show just isn’t as exciting as COPS.

58
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,780
Most of what happens in Guardians of Jiefangxi
is police officers dealing with Chinese youth

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,570
who get drunk, fight, and cheat each other.

60
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,720
And a lot of it is about dating mixups.

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,330
All the juicy drama caught on camera.

62
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,660
Girl: Me and him have been dating for five
years, but when I’m with him it’s just…

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,990
Cause we’ve been dating for so long, I just
didn’t feel secure you know?

64
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,000
And I kept trying you know?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Cop: Well let me ask.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So now you’re dating two guys at once?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Girl Sighs)

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
It’s like Jerry Springer is a confused Chinese
police officer.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,250
Young viewers all across China can find a
role model and parental figure in the police.

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,900
Cop: I think this girl feels that men are
like a commodity.

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Pick and choose.

72
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,880
At the time I felt she won’t be able to
find true happiness this way.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,870
See, the police are strong, but gentle.

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,210
The police are there to listen to you.

75
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,110
And make sure you stop hitting yourself.

76
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,110
All of Changsha…

77
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,110
I’M THE BOSS
-fighting-

78
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,110
Cop: Stop hitting yourself!

79
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,360
That scene went viral.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,420
And you know what else went viral—completely
on its own with no help from Chinese internet

81
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,820
censors?

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,850
The hashtag that reads “Check in at the
famous Changsha Pozi Street”.

83
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,460
That’s the police station where the show
is filmed.

84
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,430
And now, it’s a thing.

85
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,300
Chinese teenagers are taking photos of each
other in front of the police station, crouching

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,680
as if they’re about to be arrested.

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Haha, everybody is having fun posing as criminals.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,940
The Pozi Street Police Station absolutely
loved the positive attention.

89
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,160
The police station posted on Weibo, “Click
here!

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,350
Unlock the famous pose of the Pozi Police
Station!

91
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,080
Reminder: The ‘Cover Your Head’ pose is
mostly used when catching criminal suspects

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,300
on the spot.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,430
Pay attention that you’re doing it right!”

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,950
Yes, just in case the police someday come
after *you*.

95
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,780
But wait, there’s more!

96
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,000
The police station has now begun using their
celebrity status as a tourist site to bring

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,780
in lucky fans of the show, where they can
walk around and celebrate the police.

98
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,930
Here’s the front desk.

99
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,280
Here’s a poster for the show.

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,780
And here’s the room where we track everything
you do when you’re in public.

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,070
Guardians of Jiefangxi has been a major propaganda
victory for the Chinese Communist Party.

102
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,590
Hopefully, in the future, Chinese citizens
won’t try to run away when the police go

103
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,150
after them.

104
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,880
Instead, they’ll crouch down and submit
to authority.

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Just like on TV!

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,910
You should try it!

107
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,760
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from you, a fan who supports the show through

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,330
the crowdfunding website, Patreon.

109
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,450
Knowgoat asks: “Companies must deliver growth
to their shareholders, so as stupid as it

110
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,610
is, I understand why they look to high growth
markets.

111
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,400
But why don't Western governments step in
and regulate investments into China, effectively

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,110
making Companies look elsewhere to expand?”

113
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,360
Good question Knowgoat.

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes, a lot of publicly traded companies claim
they have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize

115
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
profits for their shareholders.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,340
Now, that’s... not actually true.

117
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,780
But it’s a great excuse to engage in practices
that are deeply unethical, but still technically

118
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,300
legal—like pouring money into Xinjiang,
an emerging investment hotspot!

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,190
Now, sure, it makes you complicit in the CCP’s
terror on Uyghurs.

120
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,130
Oh, wait, that’s not a news article.

121
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,270
It’s just like, one guy’s opinion.

122
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,220
And it’s not, as it turns out, the opinion
of the US government.

123
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,280
The Trump White House had briefly considered
blocking all US investments in China.

124
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,990
The idea—as presented to the media—was
“to protect U.S. investors from excessive

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,680
risk due to lack of regulatory supervision.”

126
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,770
And not because the CCP is murdering its own
citizens.

127
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,650
But that block never happened.

128
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,640
Eventually it was pared down to just a ban
on investing in companies directly linked

129
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,590
to the Chinese military.

130
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,190
And that was pitched as a national security
issue.

131
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,930
So why doesn’t the US government do more
to stop Americans from investing in China?

132
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,750
Because Wall Street has strong ties to Congress
and the White House.

133
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,480
And as long as Wall Street *thinks* they can
make money in China, they’ll do whatever

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,970
they can to keep the US government from stopping
them.

135
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,950
And it’s pretty much the same deal in other
Western countries.

136
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,240
Thanks for your question, Knowgoat.

137
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,550
