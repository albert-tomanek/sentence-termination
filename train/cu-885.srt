00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,890
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,710
Hong Kong gets ready for rule of law…

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,780
Nathan Law.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,280
Hi, and welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,279
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,920
Elections were just held for the Hong Kong
legislature.

7
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,949
It was a record voter turnout.

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,960
Not since the British handover of Hong Kong
to China

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,070
have so many people showed up to vote.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,099
It’s almost like they want a voice

11
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,050
in the future of their special administrative
region.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,750
And it was a crucial election.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,440
You could kind of look at it like a boxing
match.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,490
In one corner,

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,410
weighing in at 43 of the 70 seat Legislative
Council,

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,970
you have the pro-Beijing politicians,

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,690
looking to defend their business interests

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,370
with the Mainland Communist regime.

19
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,470
In the other corner,

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,019
weighing in at just 27 seats,

21
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,190
the scrappy pan-democrats,

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,399
who favor self-determination and autonomy

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,100
for Hong Kong.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,800
The pan-democrats needed to keep

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,739
a minimum of 24 seats in the Legislature

26
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,030
or they’d lose their veto power.

27
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,300
If that happened,

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,659
Beijing could do whatever it wanted with Hong
Kong.

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,799
And we know from watching history

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,460
how bad that could be

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
I have just received word

32
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,470
that the Emperor has dissolved the council
permanently.

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,900
The last remnants of the Old Republic

34
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,289
have been swept away.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,560
And Vegas odds would back the pro-Beijingers.

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,630
Because this isn’t exactly a fair match.

37
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,430
The pro-Beijing side are coming in with boxing
gloves

38
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,760
filled with rocks,

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,420
wrapped in barbed wire,

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,260
and set on fire.

41
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,799
Because this election is to democracy

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,280
what SPAM is to meat.

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,390
It kind of looks like the same thing.

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,100
They try to sell it as the same thing.

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,571
But when you open it up

46
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,190
and take a whiff,

47
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,800
you know there's something deeply wrong.

48
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,780
When the British gave Hong Kong back to China
in 1997,

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,869
the Chinese regime agreed that Hong Kong

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,860
would get to keep the freedoms everyone else
in China

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,409
was denied.

52
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,130
Which is why in 2014,

53
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,780
Hong Kong’s massive student-led

54
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,509
pro-democracy protest called the Umbrella
Movement

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,440
didn’t end up like this.

56
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,450
But over the years,

57
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,450
the Chinese regime has been gradually eroding
Hong Kong’s freedoms,

58
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,510
in much the same way Chinese leader Xi Jinping

59
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,520
has eroded the Zhongnanhai pantry

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
I’ve never seen Xi Jinping so happy...

61
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,320
And as always,

62
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,320
the Party made sure this election came out
in Beijing’s favor.

63
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,880
First of all,

64
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,200
the election was only for 40 of the 70 seats

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,320
on the Legislative council.

66
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,870
The other 30?

67
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,220
Those are chosen by “functional constituencies”

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
— basically a group of business leaders,

69
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,820
special interest groups,

70
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,680
and hooded robed figures that appear

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,310
only under the light of a full moon.

72
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,500
And these 30 functional constituencies

73
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,950
pretty much always vote the way Beijing wants.

74
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,950
In other words,

75
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,100
officials with ties to the Chinese regime

76
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,120
automatically have veto power,

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,730
no matter how the election turns out.

78
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,730
Then,

79
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,340
the Hong Kong electoral commission

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,050
forced candidates to sign pledges of loyalty

81
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,460
Six refused to sign

82
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,870
or were considered insincere

83
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,090
and banned from running.

84
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,250
Did I mention the Communist Party was eroding
freedoms in Hong Kong?

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,240
Okay,

86
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,400
so far so good.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,700
This is looking like a great election!

88
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,530
Doesn’t stop there, though.

89
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,560
During the campaign,

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,770
Nathan Law, one of the pro-democracy candidates,

91
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,300
was convicted of unlawful assembly

92
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
for his role as one of the key figures

93
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,210
in the 2014 Umbrella movement.

94
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,210
The good news is that

95
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,010
a sympathetic judge said he was showing concern
for society

96
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,250
and sentenced him to 120 hours of community
service

97
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,230
instead of jail time.

98
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,840
So that didn't work out.

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,430
But throw into the mix a little bit of vote
rigging

100
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,990
and general thuggery

101
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,840
and you've got this election in the bag!

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,820
Except for that whole “record voter turnout”
thing.

103
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
And Hong Kongers,

104
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
for some reason,

105
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,510
are getting a little afraid of mainland encroachment.

106
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,290
So instead of losing seats,

107
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,050
the pan-democrats ended up gaining:

108
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,450
Now they have 30 seats in the legislature.

109
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,400
30 out of 70 seats doesn’t sound like much.

110
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,740
But remember, only 40 seats were up for grabs,

111
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,130
so they’ve done pretty well.

112
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,430
And guess what?

113
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,290
Six of those are young protest leaders,

114
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,030
including Nathan Law.

115
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,440
And Beijing would have gotten away with it
too,

116
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,320
if it weren't for you meddling kids!

117
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,360
Chinese media, of course,

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,320
responded with their usual gloom and doom

119
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,460
State-run Xinhua,

120
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,100
citing the Chinese government organ

121
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
that oversees Hong Kong and Macau,

122
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,480
talked about "resolute opposition" to

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,200
any form of "Hong Kong independence."

124
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,820
But here’s the problem.

125
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,280
As Time Magazine put it,

126
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,220
after the Umbrella Movement didn’t result

127
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,720
in any meaningful reform,

128
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,480
“the protest leaders were dismissed by critics

129
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,630
as hapless,

130
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,350
unschooled fringe ideologues

131
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,250
who ultimately lacked real political power.”

132
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,340
Well, now they have real political power.

133
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,510
And it’s going to be a lot harder to dismiss
them.

134
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,830
So what do you think of the recent election?

135
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,510
And what do you think is in store for the
future of Hong Kong?

136
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,320
Leave your comments below.

137
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
And remember,

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,860
since YouTube is being all weird about ad
revenue,

139
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,780
consider supporting China Uncensored on Patreon.
