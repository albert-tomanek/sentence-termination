00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,300
Hong Kong wants you to shut your mouth

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,680
and keep quiet.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Or you could go to jail.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,750
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,750
Hong Kong.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,040
Pearl of the Orient.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,200
Returned to Chinese rule in 1997

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,590
under the One Country, Two Systems policy.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,110
That means Hong Kong gets to keep

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,770
all of its freedoms, until it doesn’t.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,460
Well, good news everyone.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,660
The Chinese Communist Party is no longer trying

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,300
to subvert the rule of law in Hong Kong.

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,730
It’s already succeeded.

17
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,320
You may remember Joshua Wong.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,620
He was a student leader

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,280
in the 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,970
and friend of the show.

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,899
Well, he’s been sentenced to jail.

22
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,130
Again.

23
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,930
In August, Wong had been sentenced

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,010
to six months in jail for unlawful assembly

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,830
during the Umbrella Movement.

26
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,170
He served two months locked up,

27
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,770
and then was released on bail in October

28
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,860
while he appealed his verdict.

29
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,750
But after getting out on bail,

30
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,380
Wong committed a very serious crime:

31
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,070
Exercising his right to free speech.

32
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,520
He led protests,

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,400
wrote op-eds for global newspapers,

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,500
And led more protests.

35
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,180
The good news is that Hong Kong courts

36
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,290
remembered that Joshua had already pleaded
guilty

37
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,490
to another crime they hadn’t yet

38
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,630
gotten around to sentencing him for.

39
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,970
Oops.

40
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,040
So on Wednesday,

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,229
they sentenced him to another three months
in jail.

42
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:35,119
This time, the charges weren’t for unlawful
assembly—

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,060
he’d already served time for that.

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,060
This time,

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,350
it was for not obeying a court order

46
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,110
to leave that unlawful assembly.

47
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,280
See?

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
There are always more crimes

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,430
they can charge you for.

50
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,010
In addition to Joshua Wong,

51
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,290
pro-democracy activist Raphael Wong

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,619
received four months in jail.

53
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,009
And another 14 people were given

54
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,470
suspended sentences and steep fines.

55
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,470
This harsh sentencing is probably meant

56
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,299
to be a warning to other activists in Hong
Kong:

57
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,490
Shut your mouth or we’ll trump up some charges.

58
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,879
Welcome to One Country,

59
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,139
One and a Half Systems.

60
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,060
So what do you think about all the new crimes

61
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,591
they keep finding to charge Joshua Wong with?
