1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,639
A secret recording of Hong Kong’s Chief
Executive.

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,349
She says she the first thing she would do
is quit...

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,040
*if* she had a choice.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,330
And now she’s withdrawing the controversial
extradition bill

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,420
that sparked the Hong Kong protests.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,700
But is it too little, too late?

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,560
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,999
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:30,000
I have some advice for Hong Kong’s Chief
Executive Carrie Lam:

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,730
If you propose a bill that’s so unpopular,

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,290
a quarter of the city comes out to protest;

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,160
and if you refuse to answer to any of the
protesters’ demands;

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,330
and if you become so hated that

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,050
you have to physically hide from the public;

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,070
then I suggest you ought to deal with public
discontent

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,110
as swiftly as possible—

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,640
and not wait nearly three months.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,510
But better late than never, some would say.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,310
Because on Wednesday, Carrie Lam finally—finally!—

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,870
announced that she would withdraw the extradition
bill

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,560
that could send criminal suspects to mainland
China for trial.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,470
“The government will formally withdraw the
bill

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,400
in order to fully allay public concerns.”

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,070
Unfortunately, this does *not* fully allay
public concerns.

25
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,790
It might have, had she withdrawn it

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,140
immediately after after a million people

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,360
protested back on June 9.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,260
But now, the Hong Kong people are upset

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,440
over a pretty wide range of things.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,130
Like police violence against protesters.

31
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,810
That’s why the protesters have five key
demands

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,420
for the Hong Kong government.

33
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,659
So with only one of those demands met,

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,670
it’s just not enough for most protesters.

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,590
Also, the timing is a little odd.

36
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,280
Lam withdrew the extradition bill just days
after

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,870
a secret recording of her was leaked to the
public.

38
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,020
The recording came from a private talk she
gave

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,500
last week at a luncheon.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,970
I’m going to play the whole four-minute
recording for you—

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,580
because it’s a fascinating glimpse

42
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,770
into what Carrie Lam is actually thinking.

43
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,700
"I don't want to spend your time,

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,380
or waste your time,

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,420
for you to ask me what went wrong, and why
it went wrong.

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,140
But for a chief executive to have caused

47
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:23,840
this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
It's just unforgivable.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,240
If I have a choice,

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,660
the first thing (I would do) is to quit,

51
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,310
having made a deep apology is to step down.

52
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,349
So I make a plea to you for your forgiveness."

53
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,580
"I'll be very honest with you,

54
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,630
it would be naïve for me to paint you a rosy
picture,

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,150
that things will be fine or I have a deadline.

56
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,350
But I can assure you that Beijing does not
have a deadline.

57
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,020
They know this will ripple on.

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,849
So we have made special arrangements

59
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,340
and there will be a first of October national
day celebrations

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,080
but still having a lot of disruptions,

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,940
so we are going for a modest,

62
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,739
but solemn type of celebrations on the first
of October

63
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,910
which means that they (Beijing) and ourselves

64
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,459
have no expectations that we could clear out
this thing

65
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,989
before the first of October.

66
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,370
Another thing I want to assure you,

67
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,940
that is my own feeling the pulse and through
discussions,

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,950
CPG has absolutely no plan to send in the
PLA."

69
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,950
"But the first...

70
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,380
of course I'm sure that in your hearts you
will feel,

71
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
and I'm sure a large number of people

72
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,610
feel that I do have a solution,

73
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,050
that is a political one.

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,510
But I have to tell you that this

75
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,200
is where the crux of the matter lies.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,830
Once an issue has been elevated to a national
level,

77
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,310
to a sort of sovereignty and security level,

78
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,510
let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented
tension

79
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,310
between the two big economies in the world.

80
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,900
The room, the political room for the chief
executive who,

81
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,590
unfortunately, has to serve two masters by
constitution,

82
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,169
that is the central people's government

83
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,560
and the people of Hong Kong,

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,740
that political room for maneuvering

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,240
is very, very, very limited."

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,610
"They care about the country's international
profile.

87
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,810
It has taken China a long time to build up
to

88
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,540
that sort of international profile

89
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,560
and to have some say, not only being a big
economy

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
but a responsible big economy,

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,830
so to forsake all those positive developments

92
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,320
is clearly not on their agenda.

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,890
But they're willing to play long,

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,460
they are willing to play long,

95
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,550
so you have no short term solution,

96
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,729
Hong Kong suffers, you lose tourism, economy,

97
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:13,130
you lose your IPOs and so, but you can't do
much about it,

98
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,960
but after everything has been settled the
country

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,370
will be there to help with maybe positive
measures

100
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,400
especially in the Greater Bay Area."

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,940
"Nowadays it's extremely difficult for me
to go out.

102
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,430
I have not been on the streets,

103
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,810
not in the shopping malls,

104
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,740
can't go to a hair salon,

105
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,860
can't do anything because my whereabouts will
be

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,050
spread around the social media,

107
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,800
on telegram and LIHKG,

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,210
and you could expect a big crowd of black
T-shirts

109
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,000
and black masked young people waiting for
me."

110
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,920
There’s a lot to unpack there.

111
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,780
One, she said the first thing she would do
is quit,

112
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,470
if she had a choice,

113
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,680
but she does not—implying that the higher-ups
won’t let her.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,300
Two, she said that the Central People’s
Government

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,740
has no plans to send in the People’s Liberation
Army.

116
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,610
Instead, they’re willing to play the long
game,

117
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,810
and let Hong Kong’s economy suffer as the
protests drag on.

118
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,680
Of course, Lam said that partly based on “feeling
the pulse,”

119
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,610
and I’m not sure I’d bet on her ability

120
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,940
to feel the pulse of anything,

121
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,620
including at this point, herself.

122
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,259
Three, she admits out loud that her hands
are tied

123
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,960
because she has to “serve two masters,”

124
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,460
the Chinese Communist Party and the people
of Hong Kong.

125
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,570
Although really, we all know which master
really counts.

126
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,600
And four, she can’t even go to the hair
salon

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,580
because those protesters would be waiting,

128
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,380
so life is pretty tough for Carrie Lam.

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,900
Now after this audio was leaked to the public,

130
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,169
she did what any self-respecting politician
would do:

131
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,180
She held a press conference to deny the whole
thing.

132
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,710
This is what she said on Tuesday:

133
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,229
“I have never, I have never tendered a resignation

134
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,840
to the Central People’s Government.

135
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,980
I have not even contemplated to discuss a
resignation

136
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,490
with the Central People's Government.

137
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,419
The choice of not resigning is my own choice.”

138
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,039
That’s a brilliantly worded denial.

139
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,660
It can be technically true,

140
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,130
that she ever tendered a resignation.

141
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,690
While also being totally misleading,

142
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,880
because she might have never tendered a resignation

143
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,479
because she had already been told not to.

144
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,110
When a reporter tried to question her on the
specifics of that,

145
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,300
she did what any self-respecting politician
would do:

146
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,539
She denied it again, and walked away.

147
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,690
“Your answer does not arise.

148
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:58,230
I have never tendered any resignation.”

149
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,660
But you have to feel *a little* bad for Carrie
Lam.

150
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,810
Not because she can’t get her hair done.

151
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,580
But it is pretty hard to say that

152
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,330
you didn’t say the things that you did say,

153
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,780
when someone publishes the audio of you saying
those things.

154
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,319
On the other hand, the leaked audio

155
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,389
might not be so bad for Lam.

156
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,889
Sure, it shows that she’s the helpless puppet

157
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,990
of the Chinese Communist Party.

158
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,880
But since she’s not calling the shots,

159
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,449
she can wriggle out of the ultimate responsibility.

160
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,220
And this also illustrates a larger problem
that Hong Kong faces.

161
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,800
The people can protest all they want.

162
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,930
And they do.

163
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,959
And Carrie Lam can even eventually give in
to

164
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,789
one of the protesters’ five key demands:

165
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,449
withdrawing the extradition bill.

166
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,269
But it’s not enough.

167
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,669
Because ultimately,

168
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,749
all the key decisions being made about Hong
Kong

169
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,639
are not in the hands of the Hong Kong government.

170
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,759
The decisions are being made by Beijing.

171
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,629
But if the Chinese Communist Party thinks
that

172
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:58,160
withdrawing the bill is going to be enough
to stop the protests,

173
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,970
then they’re not “feeling the pulse”
of the protesters.

174
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,959
Especially because Lam did not agree to

175
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,860
an independent investigation into police brutality—

176
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,339
something that’s angered protesters

177
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,550
and ordinary Hongkongers the most.

178
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,389
But don’t worry!

179
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,019
After Hong Kong police chased protesters into
the MTR,

180
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,730
beating and pepper spraying anyone

181
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,529
who happened to be on the trains...

182
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,279
wrestled a protester to the ground until he
passed out…

183
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,709
and then chased and tackled students on a
playground...

184
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,329
Beijing knows exactly what to do.

185
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes, they’re talking about outlawing masks
for protesters.

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,329
And punishing teachers for “heinous crimes.”

187
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,160
And introducing “patriotic education”
into Hong Kong schools.

188
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
It’s not like trying to do that in 2012
led to citywide protests.

189
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,970
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party has got this
handled.

190
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,970
So what do you think?

192
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,829
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a fan

193
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,480
who helps us keep making controversial episodes
like this,

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,569
through supporting us on the crowdfunding
website Patreon:

195
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,790
Ben asks:

196
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,139
Have there been any attempts by the CCP,

197
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,449
whether cyber attack’s or other means,

198
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,480
to shut down or limit the protestor’s use
of telegram

199
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
or other communications means?

200
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,309
Good question, Ben.

201
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,069
And the answer is: Yes.

202
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,100
They’ve tried to hack Telegram.

203
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,589
And they’ve almost certainly had agents

204
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,160
trying to monitor all the chats.

205
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,740
But that being said,

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,980
there’s not much they can do when Hong Kong

207
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,940
still has a free press and open internet.

208
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,410
Of course, there’s a solution to *that*:

209
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,509
The Emergency Regulations Ordinance of 1922.

210
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,720
That would give the Hong Kong Chief Executive
broad powers,

211
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,230
including the power to completely censor the
press—

212
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,100
and probably the internet as well.

213
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,149
But it’s such a nuclear option that they’re
unlikely to use it.

214
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,149
At least right now.

215
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,399
Thanks for your question, Ben.

216
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,139
And thank you to everyone watching.

217
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,129
Be like Ben, and support China Uncensored

218
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,660
