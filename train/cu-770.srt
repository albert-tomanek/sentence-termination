1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,390
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,740
building on the success of others.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,220
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,630
China: The Middle Kingdom.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,449
Home to many wonders.

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,610
The Great Wall of China.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,520
The Terracotta Warriors.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,130
The Classical Gardens of Suzhou.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,620
The...Sphinx?

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,039
Uhhh, what’s that doing there?

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,410
Well, you see,

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,260
modern China has a rich tradition of copying—

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,460
from McDnoald’s to Polystation.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,899
And this modern culture of copying

16
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,469
extends to a much grander scale

17
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,429
than you may imagine.

18
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,429
Chinese companies,

19
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,010
and even the Chinese government,

20
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,829
I kid you not,

21
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,309
spends millions on creating knockoffs

22
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,619
of some of the world’s most famous monuments.

23
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,329
As I always say,

24
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,569
copyright infringement is the sincerest form
of flattery.

25
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:04,259
So here are just ten of my personal favorites
from China.

26
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:05,390
Number 10

27
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,939
The Sphinx

28
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,170
I only bring it up again

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,710
because there’s not just one Sphinx.

30
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,920
I found at least two,

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,930
three,

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,940
four,

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,960
five—

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
that one now also has an Iron Man

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,560
for some reason—

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,710
and six.

37
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,659
Though that last one was a little too good

38
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,439
for the taste of the Egyptian government.

39
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,100
They were concerned it would draw tourists

40
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,329
away from the real Sphinx,

41
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,689
so they complained to Chinese authorities.

42
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,250
And amazingly,

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,659
they actually did something about it.

44
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,109
Number 9

45
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,540
The Colosseum

46
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,729
Keeping with the ancient world theme,

47
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,399
the Chinese special region of Macau

48
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,289
maintains its very own Colosseum.

49
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,670
It’s actually in use, too.

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,939
The 2,000-seat venue has regular outdoor concerts.

51
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,460
And I’m sure sooner or later,

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,920
they’ll start having prisoners of conscience

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
battle to the death there

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,369
for the amusement of officials.

55
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,670
I mean, might as well do something

56
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,340
before they have their organs harvested,

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,369
am I right?

58
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,100
I’m kidding of course.

59
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,150
The organs could get damaged.

60
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,599
Number 8

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,650
Florence—and also sort of Venice

62
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,489
200,000 square miles of former corn fields
in Wuqing

63
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,760
have been converted into an outlet mall village

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,220
inspired by...various parts of Italy.

65
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,480
I mean, who needed all those corn fields anyway?

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,909
The buildings look kind of like Florence,

67
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,270
but there’s also the Grand Canal from Venice.

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,280
Just be careful you don’t fall into the
Gap.

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,010
Number 7

70
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,220
The Louvre Pyramid

71
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,690
The actual Louvre pyramid in Paris

72
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,110
was designed by a Chinese American architect.

73
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,490
This one in Chongqing,

74
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,459
which is used as a sales office by the way,

75
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,590
is a little less awe inspiring.

76
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,740
Number 6

77
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
The Sydney Opera House

78
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,420
and Sydney Harbour Bridge

79
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,629
In Beijing, the capital of China,

80
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,182
comes this capital replica of one of the

81
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,580
most iconic things about Australia.

82
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,050
I just hope they don’t rip off the

83
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,940
second-most iconic thing about Australia.

84
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,709
The Opera House and Harbour Bridge

85
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,980
are part of Beijing World Park—

86
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,189
a 115-acre park that’s home to

87
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,340
a variety of famous world knockoffs.

88
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,569
Number 5

89
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,599
The Kremlin

90
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,739
Another one in Beijing.

91
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,520
Several government offices are here,

92
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,110
including the local weather bureau.

93
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,549
And the Chinese government spent

94
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,629
three and half million dollars on it.

95
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,640
I mean, government offices and wasteful spending
d

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,330
o just go so well together.

97
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,459
Very likely, it’s inspired by the churches

98
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,629
within Moscow’s Kremlin—

99
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,670
but minus the Christian crosses of course.

100
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,379
Because government offices and religion

101
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,940
do not go so well together.

102
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,980
Number 4

103
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,019
London’s Tower Bridge

104
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,510
While London bridges have the reputation

105
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,150
of falling down, falling down—

106
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,530
this one in Suzhou

107
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,439
seems sturdy enough,

108
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,620
considering it’s twice the size of the original.

109
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,860
See? The original one in London

110
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,580
has a measly two towers,

111
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,920
but the Chinese one has four.

112
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Just be careful:

113
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,530
To get off that highway,

114
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,610
keep an eye out for the Brexit.

115
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,170
It comes up fast.

116
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,770
Number 3

117
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,190
The Eiffel Tower

118
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,820
Though only about a third the height

119
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,110
of the original,

120
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,380
this one in Tianducheng has an advantage:

121
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,950
It has friends in other cities.

122
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,870
Though to be fair,

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,210
there are also Eiffel Tower knockoffs in America.

124
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:54,280
Like that one in Las Vegas.
Or that weird one in Queens along the I-495.

125
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,360
Number 2

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,670
Arc de Triomphe

127
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,750
Speaking of Parisian triumphs,

128
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,910
here’s a 30-foot tall Arc de Triomphe in
Jiangyan.

129
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,600
Which is a little more impressive

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,780
than the one in Guangzhou.

131
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,570
And finally, Number 1

132
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,970
Washington, DC

133
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,690
Various knockoffs of the White House

134
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,410
and US Capitol Building

135
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,190
have sprouted up across China.

136
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,280
This one has been all but abandoned

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,450
to food vendors.

138
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,780
Too bad they’re only knocking off

139
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,140
America’s buildings,

140
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,630
and not America’s rule of law

141
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,530
or basic freedoms.

142
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,490
But you know what?

143
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,020
There’s something kind of nice about

144
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,990
all these knockoffs.

145
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,220
Most of China’s 1.3 billion citizens

146
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,780
will never travel outside the country.

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,160
So when are they going to get a chance

148
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,520
to visit the White House or the Sphinx?

149
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,970
So I kind of applaud Chinese entrepreneurs

150
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,800
for tapping into this market

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,060
and bringing some of the world’s great works
of art

152
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
to the masses.

153
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,970
So which was your favorite?

154
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,800
And what is the next knockoff landmark

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,940
you’d like to see in China?

156
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,520
Leave your comments below.

157
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,280
Once again I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

158
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,220
See you next time.
