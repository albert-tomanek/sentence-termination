1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,419
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're
playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,330
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello!

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,360
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes, I did order a Crunch Corner,
but not that crunchy.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,900
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray!

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,360
Izzy. Whizzy. Let's get... busy!

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,560
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,439
Every fact they get right is a point and a
ding [DING]

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,239
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is...

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,360
And today we are talking about Camp Bonifas.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,970
Is that like a smiley Guantanamo?

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,120
-- Camp Bonny-face!
-- Bonny-face. I mean...

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,620
I mean, I'm giving you a vague point,

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,380
because it's a United Nations Command
military post. [DING]

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,270
So it's not the US, but it is 'camp' in the
sense of military post,

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,700
so I will give you the point.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,920
Camp in what other sense?! Ooh!

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,190
In the sense of a place you go
to camp with a tent!

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,730
-- What, you mean...
-- "Look at his camp bonny face!"

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,249
-- Actually, given that 'bona' is actually Polari...
-- Oh, it is!

22
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:10,079
That's not actually all that wrong.

23
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,070
Yeah. Polari being the language of gay men
in the 1950s and 60s,

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,219
descended from carnival speak. So, if you
hear Kenneth Williams --

25
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,780
Julian and Sandy -- you know, "vada your eek"
means "he's got quite a nice face".

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,090
Stuff like that. It's how gay men would talk
to each other,

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,100
so that the police and other people couldn't
hear them,

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,499
'cos obviously homosexuality was entirely
illegal.

29
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,329
Oh! And it's a star as well, isn't it?

30
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,480
Polari... that's Polaris. That's something
else. That's not quite...

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,640
Actually, loads of Polari has made it into
regular English.

32
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:42,219
Looking through... barney, having a barney,
having a fight with someone, is in there.

33
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,549
What else have we got in there?

34
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,859
To zhoozh up, a zhoozhing bag, is to do your hair
and have a handbag, or something like that.

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,319
-- And naff.
-- Naff! As terrible.

36
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,170
Basically, as with so many things, the rest
of Britain just went:

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,950
"we'll have some of that".

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,590
Bringing this all back: Camp Bonny-face...

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,499
Derailed that one!

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,179
...does not... and it's Bonifas! ... does
not mean just someone with a nice face, sadly.

41
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,200
Why is it, when you say
"United Nations Command Centre",

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,129
I immediately think "damn, that's exciting!"

43
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,689
It'd just be lots of...

44
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,299
That's because you grew up on Gerry Anderson
and Thunderbirds!

45
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:18,819
Anything! United Nations Command Centre!
Nah, it's lots of dull men looking at laptops.

46
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,790
-- It's four men with laptops in a hotel room.
-- Yeah.

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,000
We're not in a hotel room here.
Definitely not in a hotel room.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
-- It's an actual camp.
-- Is it an actual camp?

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,269
It's an actual camp, in the sense of military
encampment.

50
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,750
-- Europe?
-- Oh, definitely not.

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,220
-- America?
-- Also no.

52
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,240
-- Middle East!
-- No, you're all wrong...

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,310
-- Something Spanish-y!
-- United Nations.

54
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,569
-- Arctic! Antarctic!
-- No...

55
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,340
So not something Spanish-ish?

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,459
No. You've listed most of the
regions of the world,

57
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,639
I think you've missed
three continents so far...

58
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,819
-- Africa!
-- Two continents remaining.

59
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,760
-- Australia!
-- One continent remaining.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
-- Asia!
-- There we go! [DING]

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,519
Literally the last continent to be named.

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,779
It's not 'cos we didn't like you, we're just
saving you for last.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,019
That's a terrible chat-up line, Gary.

64
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,730
Worked for me(!)

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
Do you want that on the
cutting room floor or not?

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,189
It reflects worse on me than...

67
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,129
So where is there going to be a United Nations
Command Post in Asia?

68
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,219
-- Is it Korea?
-- Yes! [DING] You're absolutely right.

69
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:19,019
And I'm going to ask a loaded question here,
so have a point,

70
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:19,989
Which one?

71
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,110
The bottom one!

72
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,370
Can I say neither?

73
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,379
Gary gets the point there. [DING]

74
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,939
Is it the one that's on the border?

75
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,020
Yes it is! Well, it was. It's now become various
other things,

76
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,000
but yes, this was the United Nations Command
military post

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,430
400 metres south of the southern boundary
of the Korean DMZ.

78
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,329
Right. 'Cos that's the one where you have
North Korean soldiers on one side of the room

79
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,549
staring at South Korean soldiers on the other
side of the room

80
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,189
-- and they never communicate.
-- And never the twain shall meet.

81
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,739
Are they being that person in the fight going
"ey! ey!"

82
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,810
and holding the other two back?

83
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,170
Essentially, yes. That was part of their job.

84
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,489
It was returned to being Korean territory in 2006,

85
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,650
but yes, this was for many, many years the
home to the batallion

86
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,030
who oversaw the armistice agreement.

87
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,230
So what can you find there?
What could you find there?

88
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,219
Portakabins, wasn't it? It was just like school
classrooms that were effectively --

89
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,859
that was the channel you would go through
for whatever immigration was.

90
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,840
Yeah, I'll give you a point. [DING] Small
collection of buildings,

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,810
surrounded by triple coils of razor wire.

92
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,330
Oh, that's not good.

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,230
"It would look like a big Boy Scout camp if
it wasn't for..."

94
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,729
-- Goofball surgeons!
-- The guns!

95
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,130
-- All the Korean men with guns!
-- The bibimbap!

96
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,150
-- All the land mines.
-- Point! [DING]

97
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,970
If it wasn't for the land mines
that surrounded it, yes.

98
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,069
Can I just point out: must've not been on
a Yorkshire Scout camp.

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,300
Were you a Scout?

100
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,040
Yes I was a Scout! I was a Beaver, I was a
Cub, I was a Scout.

101
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,590
And I was in the St John's Ambulance as well.
Yeah.

102
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,930
I did most of the full thing, apart from becoming
a Venture Scout.

103
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,810
Did you hurt yourself? Is that how you got
in the Ambulance?

104
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,289
No, no! My Scout troop
had so few Scouts in it

105
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:06,100
after spending weeks where we
built an Airfix kit, shelled a crab...

106
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,220
What, artillery shelled a crab?

107
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,600
Yeah, there's just one crab
in the middle of...

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,000
"Bollocks to that!"

109
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,340
It was a lad called John Crabbe, actually.

110
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,410
We built a small balloon as well one night
out of tissue paper,

111
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,509
with a little basket underneath with paraffin,

112
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,139
that raced to the roof
and then it set on fire.

113
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,580
And that's how I learned how to use a CO2
fire extinguisher!

114
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,370
You see, that's a useful skill!

115
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,680
I think I learned more off that than tying
f***ing knots,

116
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,220
I'm going to be honest with you!

117
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,949
And then one night we tried cooking on a cooker,

118
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,770
one of those little paraffin cookers,

119
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,580
and it just leaked everywhere and set the
place on fire.

120
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,860
-- Again!
-- There's a pattern here.

121
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,919
Shut down shortly afterwards, what can I say?

122
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,639
And you were a Scout, weren't you?

123
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,060
I was a Scout, your Scouts were s***.

124
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,710
-- You were a proper Scout.
-- I was, yeah.

125
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,740
We used to go and build zip lines in the woods

126
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,900
and go off camping on our own.

127
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Yeah, maybe so, but did you ever win
the Scout Eurovision?

128
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,460
No, thank god, we never entered!

129
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,190
Basically, adorable kids singing adorable
songs in adorable costumes. I did...

130
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,919
You had a very different Scouting experience!

131
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,520
Well, we went Scouting instead!

132
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,860
Yeah, we didn't. See, you did things with
wood and axes...

133
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,960
Wood and mountains and axes and fires!

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,800
I sang the solo in "My Mummy Is One In A Million".

135
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,539
Actually, to be fair, by the time I actually
got to Scouts

136
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,470
the first two years were spent fighting. Literally,

137
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,639
two hours a week, go down, have a rumble,
then eventually we changed leaders!

138
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,860
We did so some... we did do that one where
you fill a boxing glove with sand,

139
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,639
tie it to a rope, and spin it round, you've
got to jump over it.

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
"That one"!

141
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,500
D'you ever play Barrels?

142
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,990
I don't... which one's Barrels?

143
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,180
Barrels is three water barrels in the middle
of a room...

144
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,849
Oh f***.

145
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,289
Full, if you're feeling particularly vindictive,

146
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,270
then the whole troop joins together in a circle.
Give us your arm.

147
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,270
-- This one or that one?
-- Like that.

148
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,749
-- Like that.
-- Yeah.

149
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,449
-- And then you run in a circle...
-- Oh god.

150
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,060
And if you let go, or if you hit the barrels,
you're out.

151
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,169
Naturally, this eventually leads to some of
the 11-year-olds

152
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,270
being put between two 16-year-olds and smashed
into the barrels!

153
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,250
Although, I've said the boxing glove one,
I've just remembered now,

154
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,490
one week we did replace
the boxing glove with an axe.

155
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,430
Nice! That's more the level we're at!

156
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,090
That's more your level of Scouting.

157
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,509
I will make the point: South Yorkshire Scouts,
West Yorkshire Scouts.

158
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,380
Whereas I had a Commodore 64.

159
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:25,940
Yeah, I did not do any...

160
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,099
I thought you were going to say you were in
the Navy!

161
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,250
"Whereas I was in the Navy!"

162
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,139
"Where I had a Commodore!"

163
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,200
-- So yes.
-- What were we talking about?

164
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,770
Camp Bonifas! Which would look like a big
Boy Scout camp...

165
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,050
Would look like a South Yorkshire
Boy Scout camp...

166
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,220
Actually, yeah, we did use to have a load
of old ammunition tins.

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,169
Some of 'em still with ammunition in, but...

168
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,069
So there was one other thing you'd find there.

169
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,530
The kind of thing you would find if you had,
say, some bored commanders

170
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,439
who were all used to doing a certain thing
with each other.

171
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,600
Pornography.

172
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,130
No.

173
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,080
A steam room!

174
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,870
Oh, definitely not.

175
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,840
Battleships! The board game.

176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,159
It's certainly a game.

177
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,470
Actual battleships!

178
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,250
Not in the DMZ?
It's a little bit to the side there.

179
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,340
Golf!

180
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,409
Point. [DING]

181
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,659
What was called "the most dangerous
hole in golf",

182
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,360
a 3-par, one-hole golf course.

183
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,159
It's got an astroturf green...

184
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,610
...and land mines!

185
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,650
And surrounded on
three sides by minefields, yes!

186
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,130
"Mulligan!" "No mulligans in this game, go
out and get it!"

187
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,940
"There's the map, good luck!"

188
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,460
Allegedly one tee shot did actually set off
a land mine.

189
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,020
Oh, brilliant!

190
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,200
"It's in the rough!"

191
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,010
Yeah, you would actually
enjoy that, wouldn't you?

192
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,349
That'd be such a great stress relief.

193
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,940
Well, it's a tee shot, it's got a bit of distance
on it, it's fine!

194
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,649
If you're, like, what, three par? So there's
a good walk there for a start.

195
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,850
That land mine going off in the distance'll
look f***ing brilliant!

196
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,010
You just get a low golf clap from the distance.

197
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,310
Oh, now that's definitely not what happened
at one point.

198
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,930
Because the name of Camp Bonifas, it was originally
Camp Kitty Hawk.

199
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,930
What happened... I mean, the name of it kind
of gives it away,

200
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,230
this is the Axe Murder incident. Now obviously...

201
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,310
What happened?

202
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,780
I'm not giving you a point for successfully
guessing that there was an axe murder.

203
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,720
But what happened in the DMZ?

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,620
Did someone wander into the DMZ by accident?

205
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,060
-- Not by accident.
-- On purpose?

206
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,920
You wouldn't need the axes, would you, 'cos
you've got land mines for that business.

207
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,630
Did the person that was wandering
have the axe?

208
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,350
They had an axe. Why would you go into the
DMZ with an axe?

209
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,490
-- Cut a tree down!
-- Point! [DING] Absolutely right.

210
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,260
-- Some of the southern side...
-- This is starting to ring a bell now.

211
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,500
Can't think why, but it is.

212
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,170
Some folks from the southern side went in
to cut down a poplar tree

213
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,350
that was blocking the UN observers.

214
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,390
The North Koreans promptly arrived with axes
of their own

215
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,310
and the tree was not being chopped down any
more, and...

216
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,910
One of the people killed was called Bonifas,

217
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,160
that's where the name of the camp came from.

218
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,500
Three days later, American - South Korean
forces,

219
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,310
they launched an operation to cut down the
tree with a show of force.

220
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,240
What did they call that operation? Name...

221
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,240
Thor!

222
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,019
Legendary American who cut down trees.

223
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,239
Washing...ton...?

224
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,080
No... oh, that's chopping down cherry trees.

225
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,240
Is it the person with the stupid hat?

226
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,990
-- Davy Crockett?
-- No, he planted trees!

227
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,399
That was Johnny Appleseed!

228
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,829
We've named every tree-related American here
and we haven't quite worked....

229
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,360
Americans in the comments will be screaming
at you at this point!

230
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
We don't know! We're not from there!

231
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,670
Famous giant lumberjack, American folklore...

232
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,740
Paul Bunyan.

233
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,139
-- Never heard that.
-- Never heard of it!

234
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,769
-- Never heard those words before.
-- Wow, okay!

235
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,560
I've heard the word Paul, and I've heard the
word "bunion", but I've never used...

236
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,899
-- Only in the sense of something on your foot!
-- Yeah!

237
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,950
Americans, we don't know about Paul Bunyan,

238
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,399
in the same way that you don't know about
Michael Barrymore. All right?

239
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,589
That's not really the same way, I'll be honest.

240
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,100
Different order of magnitude there.

241
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,600
Different order of magnitude.

242
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,860
-- More Finn McCool.
-- Oh, yes!

243
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,589
Yes, we've talked about that before.

244
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,029
More Finn McCool. Yeah, okay.

245
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,630
Actually, that's a really good... Michael
Barrymore is not...

246
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,060
I think you'll find he was a giant of light
entertainment, though.

247
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,339
What, Finn McCool?!

248
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah! Saturday nights.

249
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,600
"Appearing up on the rocks tonight!"

250
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,630
So what is at the DMZ now?

251
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,420
A tree with a hole in the bottom of it!

252
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,630
The tree is gone. The tree is gone.

253
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,639
At least they won their cause(!)

254
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,490
Yeah, they did!
And North Korea accepted that, yes,

255
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,860
"yes, okay, we probably shouldn't
have done that,

256
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,200
"yes, you've just sent in a lot of soldiers
to chop down that tree,

257
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,940
"haven't you? Okay, yes."

258
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,260
"Have the tree! Have several!"

259
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,660
I don't... a plaque or something like that?

260
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,760
Tourists!

261
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Point. [DING]

262
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,800
That's the bit you can
go and visit, isn't it?

263
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,160
You can actually go in a bit further now,

264
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,420
if you actually get permission to go in,

265
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,260
you can get to the crossing point,

266
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,870
you can technically enter North Korea briefly.

267
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,730
There are even tour companies that do things,

268
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,980
but you have to pay a
naughty government some money.

269
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,800
Yes, it is possible to get to the DMZ if you're
a tourist

270
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,260
with a lot of permissions and a lot of papers
signed now.

271
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,630
Which is closer than Camp Bonifas ever was.

272
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,570
The camp itself has been handed back to Korea.

273
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,410
But they have the Korean version of
Buckingham Palace guards!

274
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,440
-- Yes they do.
-- They're just two men standing there,

275
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,690
one of whom's fine with you being there,

276
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,180
the other who deletes the photos off your
camera.

277
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,940
-- One tells the truth, and one always lies.
-- I was going to say!

278
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,900
And one shoots people who ask awkward questions.

279
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,959
Why don't more borders work like that?

280
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,639
In the "one tells the truth,
the other only lies" fashion?

281
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,010
Because everybody's seen Labyrinth!

282
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,370
It'd be pointless! Everybody knows the answer!

283
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,490
But that's fine! That's a lovely system to
filter who comes in and out of your country!

284
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,459
If you've seen David Bowie's bulge you're
allowed in.

285
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,240
I knew it! I knew we were headed for David
Bowie's bulge.

286
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,631
It had to happen, didn't it?

287
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,820
I'm going to say this: you deserve it, if
you've sat through that.

288
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,930
Like the time I discovered the zoom function
on my DVD player

289
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,279
while my wife was out of the room.

290
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,120
And the loop feature as well.

291
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,490
So when she came back in, there was a zoomed-in,
looped version

292
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,720
of David B-- the late David Bowie's--
cock and balls

293
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,570
dancing all over the telly.

294
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,269
Not the cock and balls! Just the crotch!

295
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,529
-- Different video!
-- Well, no, this is the scene

296
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,230
where he's not got the cup on.

297
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,670
There's a point where they got him the codpiece

298
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,820
and there are scenes they shot beforehand
where they went

299
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,880
"oh boy, you can see the whole lot there".

300
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
"You know, it's like a party down there."

301
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
"It's like several puppies in a paper bag."

302
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,410
It's during the Magic Dance sequence,

303
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,260
where he's dancing from side to side,

304
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,459
going 'Dance, magic dance', that bit.

305
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:30,110
That's the bit he doesn't
have the Crotchulator on...

306
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,810
The Crotchulator!

307
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,029
Worst gym machine ever.

308
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,100
"Crotch you now... crotch you later!"

309
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,040
It's like a helicopter sideways on.

310
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
That's a plane, Gary.

311
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,000
At the end of the show, congratulations Gary,
you win this one!

312
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,889
Congraulations, you win a circular muscle
with the head of man and the body of a lion.

313
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:57,730
Oh no...

314
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,980
It's this sphinxter.

315
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,240
Urgh! Urgh!

316
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,580
-- Worst superhero ever.
-- Where's...

317
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,660
So with that we say thank you to Chris Joel!

318
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,690
Where does the muscle go
between the other parts?

319
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,530
To Gary Brannan!

320
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,490
To Matt Gray!

321
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,199
Clenching.

322
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,440
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time.

323
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,500
It's just going to go...

324
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,550
"Why is the lion walking like that?!"

325
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,920
