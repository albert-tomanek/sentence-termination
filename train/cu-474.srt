1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,040
Human-Animal Hybrids at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,870
Hong Kong is a delightful police state

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,050
And the Chinese Communist Party Celebrates
its 100th birthday

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:25,850
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:35,359
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,239
Well we have a doozy of a story for you today.

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,049
So by now you know how the US was partly funding
gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute

8
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:49,780
of Virology, where many suspect the coronavirus
pandemic leaked from.

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,440
Just a reminder, gain of function research
is where you make a virus more deadly or contagious

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,969
to humans.

11
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,889
Supposedly this research is done to prevent
pandemics.

12
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:03,249
Not working so well, is it?

13
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:08,460
But anyway you might be wondering, how did
researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,820
take bat coronaviruses, and make them contagious
to humans?

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,620
Well, their answer was human-animal chimeras!

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,130
That’s an...artistic depiction.

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,460
A human-animal chimera is what you get when
scientists inject an animal with human cells,

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,810
or engineer them with human DNA, so the animal
has certain human characteristics.

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,360
For example, a lot of research is done on
humanized mice.

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,270
No Seamus, you know what I meant.

21
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
Humanized lab mice.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,750
Thank you.

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,700
Scientists like to test things on these humanized
animals before giving a drug or vaccine to

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,530
actual humans.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,000
In some cases, the humanized animals are actually
used to create biological drugs, like certain

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
cancer drugs.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,390
That itself isn’t news.

28
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,830
Scientists began creating humanized animals
way back in the 1980s.

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,310
Presumably after a little inspiration.

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,079
And at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the
famous bat woman Dr. Shi Zhengli , had been

31
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,190
working with humanized animals for more than
a decade.

32
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,470
Here’s a paper from 2008,

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,040
talking about using chimeras for coronavirus
research.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,469
What is news is that we’ve learned researchers
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were specifically

35
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:36,209
infecting humanized mice with bat coronaviruses
in early 2019...

36
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,500
and they were trying to see if they could
get the bat coronaviruses to infect human

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
tissue.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,709
I wonder if they were successful?

39
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,150
But of course we may never know for sure,
because the Chinese Communist Party is preventing

40
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,359
any investigation into the Wuhan Institute
of Virology, and they destroyed a lot of the

41
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,670
lab’s research last year.

42
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,910
So we have no idea if their research was connected
to the coronavirus that became a global pandemic.

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,889
But at this point, the more I listen to “the
science” the more terrified I become!

44
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,859
This is how we get Planet of the Mice!

45
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,310
But with that out of the way, this week on
July 1, the world wished the Chinese Communist

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,599
Party a happy 100th birthday.

47
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,439
And there’s a lot to celebrate.

48
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,950
Not only has the Chinese regime killed way
more people than any other regime in history,

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,709
but it’s also actively made the world a
worse place.

50
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,500
Global pandemics are just the tip of the iceberg.

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,499
As US Representative Mike Gallaghersaid on
Twitter, “The atrocities we're seeing in

52
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:42,499
Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet today are not
a new development.

53
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:49,450
From the very start, brutalizing its own population
was hard-wired into the CCP's core DNA.”

54
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,390
Which is why he led a bipartisan resolution
in the House of Representatives to send the

55
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,069
CCP a birthday card, condemning China’s
gross violations of human rights.

56
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,780
And considering the Chinese Communist Party
is literally harvesting the organs of prisoners

57
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,359
of conscience, when I say gross human rights
violations, it covers all meanings of the

58
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,459
word gross.

59
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,489
But July 1st has an even more special meaning
to the people of Hong Kong.

60
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,690
Not only is it the 100th birthday party for
the CCP, it’s also the 24th anniversary

61
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,120
of when China took control of Hong Kong in
1997.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,270
And the one-year anniversary of the national
security law that took away Hong Kong’s

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,270
freedoms.

64
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,840
Now you might have heard the national security
law resulted in a mass exodus of Hong Kongers

65
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
from the city.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
I’m happy to say that’s coming to an end.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,850
Because in April authorities passed a law
that could be used to stop people from leaving

68
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,040
the city.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,330
Why would they want to leave?

70
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,260
Hong Kong is becoming a delightful police
state.

71
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,170
Which is what a senior journalist for the
now defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple

72
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,940
Daily found out when he was arrested at the
airport this week.

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,640
As pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak said, “If
it’s a police state, why not?

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,970
I don’t think there’s any problem with
a police state.

75
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,190
When we say a police state, I will view the
other side, that is the emphasis on security.”

76
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,650
Let’s just hope Alice Mak doesn’t have
a secret world like Alex Mack or else she’ll

77
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,630
be in big trouble.

78
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,030
But to help in the transition to becoming
a police state, Hong Kong’s security chief,

79
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,890
John Lee has been promoted to the number 2
official.

80
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,980
There’s certainly a lot to celebrate.

81
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,460
But please don’t, because Hong Kong police
have refused to allow a rally marking the

82
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
handover.

83
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,430
And it’s not just Hong Kong winning at human
rights.

84
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,260
China overall has the best human rights in
the world!

85
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,420
I’ll show you how after the break.

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,780
Welcome back.

87
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,340
To mark the 100 year anniversary of the Communist
Party, the Communist Party released a white

88
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,080
paper about how great human rights are in
China.

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,890
“For a hundred years, the CPC has always
put people first, applying the principle of

90
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,220
universality of human rights in the context
of the national conditions.”

91
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,380
Yeah, human rights aren’t universal.

92
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,250
Each country decides for itself what human
rights mean.

93
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,270
The West shouldn’t force its values on China.

94
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,370
The Uyghurs are very happy living in their
police state paradise.

95
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,890
So stop talking about them.

96
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,710
How does China define human rights?

97
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,860
China’s white paprs says “It regards the
rights to subsistence and development as the

98
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,070
primary and basic human rights, and believes
that living a life of contentment is the ultimate

99
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,420
human right.”

100
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,150
Like how the Great Leap forward resulted in
so much food production, people had *too much*

101
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,770
to eat, and then had to fast to lose weight.

102
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:06,830
Unfortunately, 45 million people accidentally
ended up fasting to death.

103
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,710
We just did an episode about the Great Leap
Forward, so check it out if you’d like to

104
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,840
learn more.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,980
Good news!

106
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,350
The CCP is bringing its version of human rights
to the rest of the world.

107
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,650
According to rights group Safeguard Defenders
, the UN is helping China expand its global

108
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,690
policing.

109
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,650
Are you saying we can all benefit from the
wonderful kind of police state they have in

110
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,650
Hong Kong?

111
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,560
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,
essentially the UN’s anti corruption body,

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,210
has “signed a cooperation agreement with
China’s National Supervision Commission

113
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:48,230
– its massive extra-judicial policing force
- and is refusing to release the secret content

114
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,870
of this agreement.”

115
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,150
And everyone loves a secret, so how could
that be a bad thing?

116
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,430
Now don’t get crazy.

117
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,180
China’s National Supervision Commission
is only targeting a small minority of the

118
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,330
world’s population.

119
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,960
Only about 300 million people.

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,690
It exists outside of any country’s judicial
system, so it’s basically a way to make

121
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,850
people disappear.

122
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,680
You know, like a magic trick.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,430
Everyone loves magic tricks.

124
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,610
Especially University students.

125
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,430
Especially Chinese university students studying
in Australia.

126
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,670
That’s why the Party is keeping a close
eye on them.

127
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:31,050
So they, or their family back home in China,
can also disappear at any time.

128
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,920
That’s according to a new report by Human
Rights Watch.

129
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,510
Despite studying thousands of kilometers away
from China, many Chinese and Hong Kong students

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,660
in Australia are harassed and intimidated
into censoring their speech and actions.

131
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,890
'I have to censor myself.

132
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,670
I come to study in Australia and still I'm
not free.'

133
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,240
'There were attempts to dox me, and someone
leaked the name of the building I was living

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,070
in.'

135
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,160
'If you protest against the Chinese Communist
Party abroad they will find people you love

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,460
to make you pay.'"

137
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,310
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party has a special
kind of magic.

138
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,600
That magic also includes manipulating American
businesses into serving Beijing's interests.

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,390
More after the break.

140
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,130
Welcome back.

141
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,620
According to an upcoming report from the the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,

142
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,910
“U.S. businesses are receiving guidance
and direction from Chinese officials to influence

143
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,480
business operations, investment strategy,
and strategic directions.”

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
I don’t know, sounds a bit far-fetched to
me.

145
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,090
In unrelated news, Nike’s CEO says 'Nike
is a brand that is of China and for China.'

146
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,890
Must be all that forced ethnic slave labor.

147
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,270
Nike is a brand *of* China’s forced labor,
and *for* China’s authorities.

148
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,690
Nike: Believe in something, even if it means
sacrificing everything.

149
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:12,560
Of course since the Nike CEO says Nike is
a brand that is of China and for China, I

150
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,200
guess that means it’s not the brand of America.

151
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,940
Sss we should probably all stop buying it.

152
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,630
But if the Chinese Communist Party has its
way, Nike won’t be the only company continuously

153
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,360
kowtowing to the Chinese regime.

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,680
Every company, and government really should
as well, if they know what’s good for them.

155
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,430
That was one message from Xi Jinping’s speech
celebrating the Party’s anniversary.

156
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,370
That was after a week of celebrations that
included a very normal art performance

157
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,170
That did not look anything like a dystopian
Apple ad.

158
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,710
Or North Korea on steroids.

159
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,040
In his speech at Tiananmen Square, Xi Jinping
said that “We will never allow any foreign

160
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,930
force to bully, oppress, or subjugate us.

161
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,300
Anyone who would attempt to do so will find
themselves on a collision course with a great

162
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,300
wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese
people.”

163
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,990
That’s at least according to the official
translation.

164
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,420
But as others pointed out, the original Chinese
is a bit bloodier than that.

165
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:24,080
The term Xi used literally means people would
have their “head broken and blood flowing”--

166
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,270
which sounds a little more violent.

167
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,250
So a better translation might be that people
who try to cross the Chinese Communist Party

168
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,680
will have their skulls crushed against a great
wall of steel.

169
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,080
Now that’s going back to the Party’s bloody
roots.

170
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,460
So with that, let’s all wish the Chinese
Communist Party a sweet goodnight on its 100th

171
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
birthday party.

172
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,100
It will be easy to sleep in the quiet, dark
night—since China is facing its worst power

173
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,529
shortage in a decade.

174
00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:00,240
I mean, as long as all the threats of crushing
your skull don’t keep you awake.

175
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,300
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

176
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,650
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

177
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,930
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

178
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,740
Mark Hewitson asks, “Do you think CCP is
making bitcoin crash so THEY can buy them

179
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,870
all up at a cheaper rate?

180
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,350
That’s an excellent question.

181
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,880
China recently shut down over 90% of its Bitcoin
mining.

182
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,620
And that’s just the latest in a series of
restrictions aimed at curbing crypto in China.

183
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,520
The result was a huge drop in the value of
Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies.

184
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,510
A big reason the Communist Party is doing
this is to promote its own digital currency.

185
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,380
But I really wouldn’t be surprised if many
top Party officials are using the crash in

186
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,790
Bitcoin prices to buy it up.

187
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,140
Even if your average Chinese person is forbidden
from buying Bitcoin, top Party officials love

188
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,690
to do things like that to increase their wealth,
and especially transfer their ill gotten fortunes

189
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,150
into a form that can’t easily be taken by
the Party.

190
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,279
After all, just because we’re communists,
doesn’t mean we can’t make a little money,

191
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,279
right?

192
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
Thanks for your question and your support,
Mark.

193
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,400
