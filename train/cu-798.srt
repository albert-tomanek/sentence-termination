1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,750
how does North Korea keep building these nukes?!

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,520
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,370
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:12,870
You know,

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,860
one of the best decisions I ever made

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,039
was moving from Los Angeles to New York.

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,039
Why?

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,750
Within a few years, North Korea might be able to

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,470
nuke the West Coast of the United States.

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,080
Probably by the end of the first term

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,039
of the person we’re electing this November,

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,600
they are going to have the ability

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,550
to put nuclear warheads on missiles

15
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,610
that can reach the West Coast of the United States.

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,340
Good to be nice and safe here in Manhattan.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,980
What?!

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,920
Now I know how this guy feels…

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,520
“Some days you just can’t get rid of a
bomb!”

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,960
But this is a serious issue.

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,850
North Korea tested yet another nuclear device
this month.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,340
He’s done it again.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,460
Kim Jong-Un has carried out his second nuclear test

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,460
in 8 months.

25
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,810
This one the strongest ever.

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,289
The US also now assumes

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,340
North Korea has a rudimentary miniaturized nuclear warhead.

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Hmm…

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,820
does my miniaturized nuclear device make me
look fat?

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,500
Now despite repeated attempts to pile sanction
upon sanction

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,440
and isolate North Korea,

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,570
the West has been able to do very little

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,880
to curb Kim Jung-Un’s Fat Man dreams.

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,150
North Korea is already isolated.

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,510
Only its ally China could really punish it
more.

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,050
Yes!

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,770
China will come to the rescue!

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,240
Right?

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,010
Right!

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,210
Chinese authorities are investigating a company for

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,240
“grave economic crimes.”

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
The conglomerate—

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,700
Hongxiang Industrial Development Company Ltd—

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,240
may have violated a ban by China’s own Ministry
of Commerce.

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
They were selling aluminum oxide to North
Korea.

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Aluminium oxide to those of you folks outside
the US.

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
What’s the big deal about that?

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,110
Well, according to the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission,

49
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,280
it’s a key ingredient in uranium enrichment.

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,710
This is just one of several key nuclear ingredients

51
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,910
this Chinese company was shipping to North Korea.

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,140
Fortunately,

53
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,080
Chinese authorities are cracking down on this
greedy corporation

54
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,670
that would sacrifice global security for profit.

55
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,410
Except it turns out, that’s not at all what
happened.

56
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,910
You see,

57
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,880
when local police posted this message,

58
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,860
what they actually meant by “during their work,”

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,140
is that two officials from the US Department of Justice

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,110
told them what Hongxiang was doing

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,590
and that Chinese authorities had better do
something about it.

62
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,290
So I guess their work

63
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,390
is just doing what the US government tells
them.

64
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,080
Not that I... know...anything about that...

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,150
Anyway,

66
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,650
Chinese authorities made the move

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,570
only days before this report by a South Korean
think tank

68
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,760
and a Washington research group.

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,470
It specifically singled out Hongxiang.

70
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,570
So this makes it look like the Chinese regime

71
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,350
is actually doing something about a nuclear North Korea.

72
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
And it is.

73
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,500
It’s supporting a nuclear North Korea.

74
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,040
You see, China trades with North Korea.

75
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
A lot.

76
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
In fact,

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,960
China is North Korea’s biggest trading partner.

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,420
China and North Korea have been buddy-buddies
for a long time.

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
To be fair though,

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,620
the friendship has soured a bit in recent
years,

81
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,630
with Kim Jong-un being a smidge more volatile
than his father.

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,010
And this is also partly because

83
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,350
certain Chinese leaders who had close ties
with North Korea

84
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,510
have been purged.

85
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,260
Also, North Korea has been testing nukes

86
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,940
close to the Chinese border,

87
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,530
which is kind of annoying.

88
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,180
Speaking of close the Chinese border:

89
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,300
The City of Dandong.

90
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,640
It’s a major trading center with North Korea.

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,820
That’s the location of Hongxiang Industrial Development—

92
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,260
the company that just got busted.

93
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,120
Hongxiang itself has been trading with North
Korea

94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,880
for a long time.

95
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,819
And it’s pretty hard to believe that the
Chinese regime

96
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,040
somehow didn’t know what they were really
up to

97
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,130
all these years.

98
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,120
I mean,

99
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,430
we’re talking about the regime behind the
world’s

100
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,569
most intrusive mass surveillance system,

101
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,670
with 30,000 internet police,

102
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,880
and with a Party Secretary in every big company.

103
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,600
And we’re expected to believe that,

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,220
somehow,

105
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,560
they had no idea what Hongxiang was doing

106
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,160
until the Americans told them?

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,900
The Chinese regime is absolutely keeping tabs

108
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,690
on Chinese companies’ trade with North Korea.

109
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,820
That’s what gives China its biggest bargaining
chip

110
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,130
with other countries.

111
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,720
That’s why each time the US starts freaking
out about nuclear testing

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,970
in the Evil Empire,

113
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,460
it has to be all like,

114
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,660
“Help me, China!

115
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,690
You’re my only hope!”

116
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,310
So back to Hongxiang Industrial Development.

117
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,320
Chairwoman Ma Xiaohong has called her company

118
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
a “golden bridge” between China and North
Korea.

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,790
Figuratively of course.

120
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,669
Otherwise starving North Koreans would melt
it down to buy food.

121
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,340
And Ma was in pretty good with the Chinese
regime.

122
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,810
She was a member of the Liaoning Province
People’s Congress.

123
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,870
The Ministry of Commerce even gave Hongxiang
a license

124
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,169
to import oil products.

125
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,270
Private Chinese business can only do that
with special permission.

126
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,590
So when the Ministry of Commerce banned aluminum
oxide sales

127
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,910
to North Korea,

128
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,080
but her well-connected conglomerate does it anyway,

129
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,150
that is not a surprise.

130
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,790
Neither was it a surprise to Ma when North
Korea first tested nuclear weapons

131
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,790
in 2006.

132
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,360
In fact,

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,180
Chinese authorities haven’t even made it
clear whether or not Ma herself

134
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,460
is under investigation.

135
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,010
But Ma might be in trouble anyway.

136
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,170
Earlier this month,

137
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,949
she, along with 451 others,

138
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,710
were stripped of their positions in the Liaoning
People’s Congress.

139
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,620
But that had nothing to do with selling uranium
enrichment components

140
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
to North Korea.

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,800
Apparently a lot of these Liaoning People’s
Congress members

142
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,470
got their positions through bribery.

143
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,229
Ma still got to keep her company though.

144
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,360
So at first glance,

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,810
it looks like the Chinese regime is taking
steps

146
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,720
to stop a nuclear madman from endangering
the world.

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,360
But really, it’s because the US forced their hand,

148
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,919
and the head of the company was in trouble

149
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,790
for something totally different anyway.

150
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,450
So what do you think of the Chinese regime’s
trade with North Korea?

151
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,000
Leave your comments below.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,270
Did you find this episode controversial?

153
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,810
Then you might want to check out what that
could mean for this video.

154
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,000
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,180
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

156
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,560
See you next time
