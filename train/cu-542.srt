1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,080
Promises:

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,080
Easy to make.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,200
And for Chinese leaders,

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,100
even easier to break.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,100
Here are 5 Trade Promises China Has Broken.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,960
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,260
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,960
We all know there’s a trade war between
China and the US.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,740
But we didn’t start the fire.

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,070
It was always burning

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,600
since the World Trade Organization let China
join.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,700
That was back in 2001.

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,820
And it came after certain US officials

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,140
had lobbied for years to let China into the
WTO club.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,240
“I strongly support China’s admission
into the World Trade Organization.

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,130
The World Trade Organization—or WTO for
short—

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,670
is an international group created in 1995

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,660
to help governments negotiate trade deals.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,220
The idea was to make international trade as
free, and easy,

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,680
and non-violent as possible.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,140
Unlike the tragic Molasses War of 1882.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,400
That was a sticky situation.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,820
Anyway, US corporations had been lobbying
President Clinton

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,299
to help China join the WTO,

25
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,750
because they were confident that if only they
could

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,920
get access to the China market,

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,470
they would make so much money!

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,280
I mean, er, help bring, um, democracy to China.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,470
Yeah, that’s the reason!

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,770
“The more we bring China into the world,

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,950
the more the world will bring freedom to China.”

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,340
That worked out well...for the Chinese regime.

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,979
Entering the WTO in 2001

34
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,520
gave China access to other countries’ markets,

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,979
and spurred China’s super-fast economic
growth.

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,829
But there was supposed to be a catch to joining
the WTO.

37
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:43,540
China had to agree to the rules outlined in
this 103-page document

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,189
called “Accession of the People’s Republic
of China”.

39
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,170
Also known as “The Protocol.”

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,789
Well that sounds totally normal and not weird
at all.

41
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,811
Fast forward 18 years, and the world

42
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,759
has been doing a lot of trade with China,

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,539
but the Chinese regime has still not complied

44
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,220
with quite a number of their Protocol commitments.

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,340
Which is a nice way of saying, they’ve been
cheating.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,470
So in today’s episode,

47
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,570
we’ll focus on 5 trade promises that China
made—

48
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,190
and broke.

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,080
Broken Promise Number 5:

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,980
Ending Price Controls

51
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,560
When China joined the WTO,

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,840
they promised to end price controls.

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,970
That is, to “allow prices for traded goods
and services

54
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,460
in every sector to be determined by market
forces.”

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,540
But guess what?

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,170
In a 2018 report to congress on China’s
WTO compliance,

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,790
the United States Trade representative said
China’s

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,460
“government and the Party continue to control

59
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,270
or otherwise influence the prices of key factors
of production.”

60
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah, they’re not ending price controls.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,500
There are a number of products and services

62
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,840
currently subject to government-set prices—

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
including pharmaceuticals, tobacco,

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,560
natural gas and telecommunications services.

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,680
Which means foreign companies

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,680
find it hard to compete in those industries,

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
plus a lot of related industries.

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,290
For example, price controls on fuel

69
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,300
mean that energy is cheaper in China,

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,010
which makes it cheaper to manufacture a lot
of products.

71
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,460
All these things add up to mean that goods

72
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,300
are cheaper to make in China

73
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,020
than in other developing countries

74
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,000
where wages are also low.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,830
Broken Promise Number 4:

76
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,530
Ending Subsidies

77
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,990
The Chinese regime props up a lot of industries

78
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,820
through grants and loans from state-owned
banks.

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,020
And in some cases,

80
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,270
local governments also offer land rights at
super low prices,

81
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,460
to make it cheaper for certain industries
to get started.

82
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,180
And—like price controls—

83
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,450
these subsidies have enabled a lot of Chinese
companies

84
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,520
to sell products at below market rates.

85
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,060
“Pervasive involvement of the Chinese government

86
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,420
has resulted in numerous subsidies

87
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,830
being provided to Chinese companies

88
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,280
leading to artificially low-priced manufactured
goods,”

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,170
say the authors of a study called

90
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,040
China’s Long Road to Market Economy Status.

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,150
Of course, the Chinese regime

92
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,180
has promised to remove these state subsidies.

93
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,810
But the US Trade representative has identified

94
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,610
“hundreds of prohibited subsidies

95
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,970
in a wide range of manufacturing sectors.”

96
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,999
“These subsidies contribute to the serious
excess capacity problems

97
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,669
that plague industries like steel, aluminum,

98
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,289
solar panels and fishing

99
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,740
and devastate global markets and foreign competitors.”

100
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,600
Why do you think your made-in-China solar
panels are so cheap?

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,419
On top of that, China promised to disclose
its subsidies,

102
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,729
but has reneged on that promise too,

103
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,490
by hiding the subsidies being provided on
a local level.

104
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,090
“China continues to shield

105
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,979
massive sub-central government subsidies

106
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,599
from the scrutiny of WTO members.”

107
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,599
I get it.

108
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,699
If you’re going to give out illegal subsidies,

109
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,380
you really should try to cover your tracks.

110
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,889
Which leads us to...

111
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,400
Broken Promise Number 3:

112
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Transparency

113
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,060
The Chinese Communist Party has never been

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,659
particularly good about being transparent.

115
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,800
I mean, just Google “China cover up”

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,879
and you’ll see what I mean.

117
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,590
And when it comes to trade,

118
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,970
“China disregards many of its WTO transparency
obligations,

119
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,819
which places its trading partners at a disadvantage

120
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,999
and often serves as a cloak for China to conceal

121
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,440
unfair trade policies and practices from scrutiny.”

122
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,830
For example, China promised to make available

123
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,719
to its WTO trading partners

124
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,289
all trade-related laws and regulations

125
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,840
before they’re implemented or enforced.

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,350
They don’t do that.

127
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,539
China also promised to provide translations

128
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,050
of all of its trade-related laws into English,

129
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,850
French or Spanish.

130
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,730
They don’t do that, either.

131
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,020
In fact, the Chinese government never even
set up

132
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,340
an agency or program to undertake these translations,

133
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,610
which, again,

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,689
are a basic requirement for being part of
the WTO.

135
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,490
But I get it.

136
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,560
Lotta laws, lotsa hassle,

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,610
all that translation and notification ahead
of time.

138
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,180
Maybe you just have to request them, right?

139
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Nope.

140
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,910
“Not only does China have a poor record

141
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,539
of adhering to its notification obligations,”

142
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,349
says the US Trade Representative,

143
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,180
“but it also fails to cooperate when other
members

144
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,059
make requests for information.”

145
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:20,430
China’s regulatory system is so opaque,
in fact,

146
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,150
that foreign companies and governments

147
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,029
can’t fully understand legal requirements

148
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,710
in some areas of the Chinese economy.

149
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,979
This obviously puts foreign companies at a
huge disadvantage.

150
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,559
It means they can be accused of breaking laws

151
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,809
they didn’t know existed

152
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,819
and had almost no way of finding out about

153
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,289
because Chinese officials basically kept them
opaque.

154
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,409
But even if foreign companies did have a full
understanding

155
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,770
of China’s laws and regulations,

156
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,240
that still might not be of much use.

157
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,889
And that’s because of...

158
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,090
Broken Promise Number 2:

159
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,150
A Fair and Impartial Justice System

160
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,779
Before entering the WTO,

161
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,860
China committed to broad legal reforms that
included transparency,

162
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,550
equal treatment under the law,

163
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,249
and a fair judicial review process.

164
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,419
If these reforms were implemented,

165
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,569
they would strengthen the rule of law and
make it easier

166
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,270
for foreign companies to do business in China.

167
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,650
But, surprise!

168
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,909
That hasn’t happened.

169
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,569
A study done for a U.S. industry association

170
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,089
anonymously interviewed companies doing business
in China.

171
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,439
Off the record, these companies reported time
and again

172
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,659
that officials took advantage of China’s
utter lack

173
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,879
of any type of foreign investment approval
process

174
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,860
to block foreign investment.

175
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,969
Or officials force the foreign company

176
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,680
to take on a Chinese joint venture partner,

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,219
or to extract valuable commercial secrets

178
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,889
as a price for market entry.

179
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,479
The extent of the problem is likely underreported,
the study says,

180
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,689
because companies are scared to speak out
publicly.

181
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,569
That’s because foreign companies have received

182
00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:00,270
“explicit or implicit threats from Chinese
government officials –

183
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,069
typically made orally rather than in writing
–

184
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,999
about possible retaliatory actions

185
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,659
that could have severe repercussions

186
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,569
for a company’s business prospects in China.”

187
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,050
The US Trade representative says this kind
of situation in China

188
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,499
is “able to persist in part because of

189
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:19,360
the absence of the rule of law in China,

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,639
which fosters the use of vague and unwritten
policies.”

191
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,650
And finally...

192
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,699
Broken Promise Number 1:

193
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,039
Protecting Intellectual Property

194
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,849
Remember the 103-page Protocol?

195
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,019
In it, China promised to stop forcing foreign
companies

196
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,339
to hand over their valuable, sometimes sensitive
technology.

197
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,810
After a seven-month investigation

198
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,209
into China’s unfair trade practices,

199
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,839
the US Trade Representative last year

200
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,440
issued a long list of hair-raising accusations.

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,980
They include forced technology transfer,

202
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,730
state sponsored cyber-theft,

203
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,680
and industrial espionage.

204
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,610
Which makes China’s failure to protect U.S.
intellectual property

205
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,120
from theft by Chinese companies seem almost
insignificant.

206
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,860
The report found that “Chinese theft of
American IP

207
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,940
currently costs between $225 billion

208
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,519
and $600 billion annually.”

209
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,089
And that is probably a low-ball estimate.

210
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,230
But besides the money,

211
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,410
there’s also the security risk posed by
China

212
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,610
using the advanced technology it steals

213
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,060
to gain a military advantage.

214
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:31,120
Like those J-20 fighter jets that look just
a little too familiar.

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,459
So what should the US do with this basket

216
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,600
of China’s broken trade promises?

217
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,910
Well, if you ask president Trump, it’s tariffs.

218
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,370
“China has been taken advantage of the United
States

219
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,370
for many, many years.

220
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,160
I'm not just talking about during the Obama
administration.

221
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,940
You can go back long before that.”

222
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Not to name names here,

223
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,149
but we’ve been taken advantage of long before
Obama...

224
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,300
To balance out the Chinese regime’s decades
of cheating,

225
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,190
Trump put tariffs on Chinese imports.

226
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,800
But then the Chinese regime hit back

227
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,590
by putting their own tariffs on US goods.

228
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,440
Then the US added more tariffs,

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,449
and China added more,

230
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,110
and then there was going to be a trade deal

231
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,510
but it fell through, and now there’s a trade
war.

232
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,000
So what’s going to happen now?

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,430
“You want to know something?

234
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,870
You want to know something?

235
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,500
We always win.”

236
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,339
Or...the Chinese Communist Party

237
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,819
could just honor its trade promises,

238
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,480
and then we’d all win.

239
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,160
But I won’t hold my breath.

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
So what do you think about

241
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,630
all the trade promises China has broken?

242
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,730
Leave your comments below.

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,740
