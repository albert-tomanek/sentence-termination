1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,810
Tear gas, pepper spray,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,620
and rubber bullets

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,960
Hong Kong didn’t change China

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,540
China changed Hong Kong

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,020
But protesters are trying to change both

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,600
After more than 100 days of protests

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,450
and more than 2000 cans of tear gas,

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,220
Hong Kong protests have entered a new phase.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,220
"Chris Chappell here\h in Hong Kong.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,220
We were here back in June,

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,220
just as this protest movement just began."

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,220
"Chris Chappell here back in Hong Kong.

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,220
We were here back in June,

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,220
when these protests first began."

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,660
After more than 3 months,

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,911
a lot of the protesting looks the same.

17
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:36,739
There’s still broad support in Hong Kong
society,

18
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,649
with people from all walks of life coming
out

19
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,170
Creative protest art can be seen everywhere.

20
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,989
And leaderless, guerrilla style organization

21
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,089
is still the preferred tactic.

22
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,079
Sure, the police have gotten

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,499
a little more liberal with the pepper spray.

24
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,690
And tear gas.

25
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,729
And violence.

26
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,170
But protesters still have more or less the
same five demands

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,390
they’ve had since the beginning.

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,420
But now there’s a new focus of the protests.

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,980
They’re going after the big bad,

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,620
the final boss—

31
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,760
the Chinese Communist Party.

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,570
Some protesters have started calling them
the Chinazis.

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,370
Yes, the protests have gone on for so long,

34
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,060
they’ve triggered Godwin’s Law.

35
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,890
Godwin’s Law states that

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,310
as an internet discussion goes on,

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,240
the probability of comparing your enemy to
Nazis

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,710
approaches 100%.

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,200
The Party ultimately has the final say

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,130
over what happens in Hong Kong.

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,360
That means the Hong Kong government

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,160
is completely unaccountable to the people
of Hong Kong.”

43
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,720
No matter how many millions protest.

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,880
On Saturday night,

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,800
the Civil Human Rights Front,

46
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
which has organized some of the biggest marches

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,740
over the past 100 days,

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,270
held an Anti-Authoritarianism Rally.

49
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,060
It marked the 5-year anniversary of the 2014
Umbrella Revolution.

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,500
Hundreds of thousands joined.

51
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,420
While the protests were largely peaceful,

52
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,030
a smaller group of protesters smashed

53
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,380
the windows of government offices.

54
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,810
And blocked this major road

55
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,800
near the Hong Kong Legislative Council Office.

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,959
Though they did take barriers down to let
firefighters through.

57
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:16,959
But on Sunday,

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,810
it was the Chinese Communist Party

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,459
that was at the center of protesters' fury.

60
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,700
“Today is the Global Anti-Totalitarianism
March.

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,160
Wait, Shelley, what’s the difference between

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,709
Authoritarianism and Totalitarianism?”

63
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,860
“Just wait”

64
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,900
Ok, Totalitarianism has way more tear gas.

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,310
The Hong Kong police did not grant a permit
for this march,

66
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,079
making this an illegal assembly.

67
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,109
And so the police have come out in force.

68
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,269
"They fired the tear gas right next to me.

69
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,480
My ear's kind of ringing from that.

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
But my god, that was loud.

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Ear's still ringing.

72
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I don't know why the police suddenly went
off,

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
but oh man, I'm gonna get this nice and tight."

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
In fact, the police started firing tear gas

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,799
before the march had even started.

76
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,359
When most of the people around were just reporters

77
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,769
and people trying to go shopping.

78
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,569
Until they got mad at the police.

79
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,999
"That's a media liaison.

80
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,669
They're telling us that we need to get out
of here.

81
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,900
They're telling the press to leave.

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,510
That they're sweeping the area.

83
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,420
All in all it's a great world anti-totalitarianism
festival."

84
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,049
But Hong Kong protesters don’t see this

85
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,529
as just their fight against the Chinese Communist
Party.

86
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:27,379
They see it as the world’s fight.

87
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,889
In this open letter,

88
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,540
Hong Kong protesters “call for the free
world to join us

89
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,760
and stand as one against the greatest threat
it has ever seen.”

90
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,849
That threat being the Chinese Communist Party.

91
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,359
And there are signs protesters

92
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:44,019
are getting the world to pay attention.

93
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,040
At least 40 cities worldwide

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,099
have held similar protests this weekend

95
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,329
to support Hong Kong.

96
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,329
“This is extremely gutsy.

97
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,459
The Chinese Communist Party is not known for

98
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,549
taking criticism very well.”

99
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,310
“Watch out for pepper spray!”

100
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,650
Despite the tear gas and pepper spray,

101
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,999
tens of thousands of Hong Kongers marched.

102
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,659
“It’s become more and more dangerous

103
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,219
to come out to these protests.

104
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,120
What keeps you coming out?”

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,300
“Oh, it’s so simple.

106
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,449
Because I love this place.

107
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,449
That’s all.”

108
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,239
"Why are you targeting the Chinese Communist
Party

109
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,849
instead of just the Hong Kong government?"

110
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,750
“Because they’re the boss of this event.

111
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,709
Even we already defeat the Hong Kong government,

112
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,500
they still try to control it.

113
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,410
If we do not defeat it,

114
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,670
Hong Kong is over.

115
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,450
"Now the Chinese Communist Party is not known

116
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,010
for taking criticism very well.

117
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,180
Are you worried?"

118
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,880
"We're not worried ’cause...

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,760
our ultimate goal is to raise the awareness
internationally,

120
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,850
so other countries will try to help.

121
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,850
Are you worried?"

122
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,850
“I’m not worried.

123
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,970
Because today,

124
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,470
when stand out I have nothing left,

125
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,030
alright, I could die for democracy.

126
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,020
This is what a civilization should does.”

127
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,800
"And do you think you can bring change?”

128
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,170
“We all believe it.

129
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,940
Every protester come out,

130
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,780
we all believe it.”

131
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,160
So the World Anti-Totalitarianism rally

132
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,130
was a complete success.

133
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,400
For about 15 minutes.

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
Until the police showed up again.

135
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,090
Although, you could say that police

136
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,660
breaking up an anti-totalitarianism rally

137
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,400
is the perfect way for this to end.

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,350
“So..aw jeez...the unrest in Hong Kong has
been

139
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,310
an existential threat to the Chinese Communist
Party.

140
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,520
But with the protesters now targeting the
party itself,

141
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,710
it’s anyone’s guess how the Party’s
going to respond.

142
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,820
But no matter how the Party responds,

143
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,680
one thing is for sure.

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,140
After the tear gas clears,

145
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,200
the Hong Kong protesters will keep on marching.
