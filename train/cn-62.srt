1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,680
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,720
Joining me today:
He reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,520
Follow me on Twitter at toast @...!

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,740
No, it's bollocks.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,940
[Laughter]

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,940
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,340
[Sings]  'Pull down your pants and s*** on the ants,
In an English country garden.'

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to have to get the bleep out in the first minute!

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,700
Thought I'd make it easy for you.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,720
And the bounciest man on stage — Matt Gray!

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,360
We're live! We can do visual gags!

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,860
[Laughter]

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,700
[Laughter]

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,080
[Laughter]

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,620
Like Bob Dylan before he went electric.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,120
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't see it.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,340
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,860
And there's a special prize for
particularly good answers, which is...

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
[Audience sings]

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
MATT and TOM: Oh yeah.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,880
And today we are talking about Ruth Belville.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,040
MATT: Belville?

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,940
GARY: Belville! A town of bells!

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
TOM: I mean, I don't imagine that's the etymology...

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,820
Well, you never know, do you?

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,440
Oh! Is it a town of Ruth Bells?

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,300
Oh!

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,640
Ruth Bell-ville. Right.
Okay, sorry. That took me a second.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,220
No. Two words, one name.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,740
Is it a person or a place?

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,000
TOM: It is definitely a person.

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,080
MATT: It's a person?
GARY: It's a person.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
CHRIS: Is it a woman?

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,540
TOM: Yes.
GARY: Get in!

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,220
[DING]

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,500
Point for that man!

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,320
MATT: First point of the day.

38
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,160
Is anyone keeping track of the points here?
Because I'm not. I'll be honest.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,960
[Laughter]

40
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,260
GARY: Well, we never do.

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,960
TOM: Do you want to guess
whenabouts we're talking about?

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
The Victorian era!

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,300
[DING]

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,580
GARY: When we play our best.
CHRIS: Never fails.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,180
GARY: The time of big hats and iron!

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,700
Does she have any iron?

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
[Laughter]

48
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,880
Careful answer!

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,400
She has some silver.

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,920
Used to be gold, it's now silver.

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,580
So she has no iron.

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,180
She's not massively anaemic,
if that's what you're saying.

53
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,120
That's not in here.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,820
Yeah, you know me, Tom.
I'm right there on the anaemia gags.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
Did she have a trouser press?

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,380
TOM: She is famous for having a physical object.

57
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,460
Oh great. So we've got a woman who has a thing.

58
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,420
With silver, that was originally gold...

59
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,080
GARY: A silver thing.
MATT: Was it a goblet?

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
TOM: I'm sorry, was it a what?

61
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,360
Was it a goblet?

62
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
CHRIS: Hang on, a gold...?

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,820
That's not the gesture for 'goblet', Matt.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,520
MATT: One can cup a cup.

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah!

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,340
TOM: We've found the audience's level. That's good.

67
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,580
And it's down there!

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,400
It is something that would come in silver and gold.

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,940
It would have a silver or gold case on it.

70
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,760
MATT: Was it a jewellery?

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Watch!

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,320
TOM: Point! [DING]
MATT and GARY: Wahey!

73
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,280
TOM: You're absolutely right.
MATT: You're our points man.

74
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,340
Absolutely.

75
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,760
It's the beard that's feared.

76
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,080
Elizabeth Ruth Naomi Belville, 1854 to 1943,

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
and known for carrying around a watch.

78
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

79
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,380
Was she... I'm going to go with something answery.

80
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,680
Something to do with trains and time zones?

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,860
I mean, given it's a watch — it's to do with time.

82
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,040
[Laughter]

83
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,460
No!

84
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,860
MATT: I'm not hearing a ding!
[DING]

85
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,980
CHRIS: Official keeper of the Queen's O'Clock.

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,780
Oh, you know what... [DING]

87
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,900
It's not quite — it's close. Official Keeper of
the Queen's O'Clock... we're getting closer.

88
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,520
CHRIS: Corgi s***ting time.

89
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,340
Greenwich Mean Time
certainly has something to do with it.

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,080
Corgi S***ting Time...

91
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,480
I've just realized I said that.

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,040
It's little used. It's 37 minutes off the hour.

93
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,160
MATT: CST.

94
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,220
'Excuse me, Ma'am, I just need to take the corgis.'

95
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,840
[Queen voice] 'Oh yes, it's s***ting time.'

96
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,180
Just going to set my watch to Corgi S***ting Time.

97
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,940
I tell you what, it is basically —
that 37 minutes is corgi s***ting time.

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,960
'Finchley! They're still in the parlour!'

99
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,700
Someone at Buckingham Palace somewhere is
pulling out the elaborate silver dish right now.

100
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,920
CHRIS: Used to be gold, you know.

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
It does tarnish so.

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
GARY: Yes!

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,040
Why would someone in Victorian London,
and later, up to World War Two,

104
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,080
be going around with a watch?

105
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,220
Was she an official clock-setter
for some town or borough?

106
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,060
TOM: Hmm... I'll give you a point for that. [DING]

107
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,520
Certainly — I don't think official. This was not...

108
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,100
Unofficial. Going around setting it
to her own bloody time.

109
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,920
She's a guerrilla time setter.

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,380
GARY: You can't set time on a gorilla!

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
They don't wear watches!

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
It's like a s*** Banksy!

113
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,460
'Ah ha ha! You thought it was
five minutes later than it is!'

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,260
GARY: Yeah, but would —
MATT: 'But I *know* it's wrong, 'cos I have a watch!'

115
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,200
Ah! Now...

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
Can I make the point, if the gorilla told you the time,
you wouldn't disagree with it though, would you?

117
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,420
Whatever time he says it is.

118
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,460
TOM: I will point out, you're getting very close there.

119
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,080
This is how...
[Laughter]

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
No, Gary isn't. Matt is.

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,880
This is someone who went round selling...

122
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,700
MATT: Oh! Oh!
CHRIS: Time.

123
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,220
'I know the time! Give me a fiver
and I'll tell you the time' — kind of person.

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,020
[DING]
TOM: Yup.

125
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh my God.

126
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,200
TOM: Absolutely right. Spot on.

127
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,080
I bet you can do that in Leicester Square.

128
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,660
I mean, you wouldn't want to do it in Parliament Square,
because you've got Big Ben there,

129
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,780
but Leicester Square...

130
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,780
[Laughter]

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
GARY: 'It's 11:55.'
DONGGG...

132
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,700
'Trust me. That's wrong.'

133
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,380
That's not actually Big Ben.
That's just Gary going 'DONGGG...'

134
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,860
Which bit of me, remains open to be seen.

135
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,320
If you do go to Parliament Square on a Thursday night,

136
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,280
you can just see him standing in the corner
doing an impression of Big Ben.

137
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,720
Yeah! I even put the pointy hat on and everything.

138
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,040
And for some tourists, the very small / far away thing,
it does work as well.

139
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
How big's the pendulum, Gary?

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,740
You don't want to know.

141
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Hahey!

142
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,600
All I'll tell you is, it's regulated by a penny every year.

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,660
That's true, innit? They regulate
the pendulum on the clock on Big Ben

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,500
by putting pennies on or subtracting it,
to half a second or something?

145
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,740
Something like that, yeah.

146
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,680
Old pennies.

147
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,420
Well, with the exchange rate at the moment,
it's going to be pounds by the end of the year.

148
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,400
We're rich!

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,800
And you wanted us to do the Brexit one. There you go.

150
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,960
Yes. This was a woman called Ruth Belville,
who like her father and her father before her...

151
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Her father and *his* father before *him*...
[Laughter]

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,360
GARY: Get a diagram!

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
MATT: For generations.

154
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,660
Pronouns are always difficult.

155
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,220
MATT: Generations. You need the word 'generations'.

156
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,580
For generations, had sold the time to people
who needed to know it accurately.

157
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,580
So where did she go to get that?

158
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Time Magazine.

159
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,140
It's a grudging Biscuits.

160
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,500
But it's a Biscuits.

161
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,020
Oh, we're not putting scales of biscuitry in here, are we?

162
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,820
So where did she go to get the proper time
in Victorian London?

163
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,340
This was originally 1836 when her father created it.

164
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,360
The London Time Dump.

165
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,140
[Laughter]
TOM: Now...

166
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,000
That's a good description for what this would be.

167
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,380
GARY: Oh great! I win then.

168
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm not giving you a point for it...

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,020
but where in London —

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,540
GARY: Damn my short arms!

171
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,200
Where would you go to get the time?

172
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,280
Greenwich, I would assume.

173
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,160
Yeah, Greenwich.

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,460
Yep. [DING] Absolutely right. Greenwich Observatory.

175
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,600
You see the nonchalance on that?
[Click]  Yeah, it's fine.

176
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,260
Greenwich Observatory, you would go
to the clock that is outside it...

177
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,140
Surely you'd go to its herb garden.

178
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,740
-- [Groans] Thyme!
-- Oh, f*** you.

179
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,760
Oh.

180
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,560
I heard a muttering of discontent in the crowd there.

181
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,880
GARY: That got the reaction
it purely deserved, which was 'Ughh...'

182
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
That's just the despair of 400 people in front of me.

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
That is what my puns are worth!

184
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,360
Ahh.

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,180
That's bat under the arm, back into the pavilion,
shaking your head — really, I'm sorry.

186
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,560
Yes. There is a clock outside
called the Shephard Gate Clock...

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,880
What's unusual about it?

188
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
MATT: It's got sheep on it!

189
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,900
No hands on it.

190
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,820
Shepherds only can go under it!

191
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,860
No to all of those things!

192
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,700
Are you sure?

193
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,500
I mean, it's set on a wall, so if anyone
could get under it I'd be very surprised.

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
Is it on a Viking street named Shepherd Street?

195
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,920
Er, no. It's by the Shephard Gate of the Observatory.

196
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,560
Sheep work like sundials, don't they?

197
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
They all face the same way...

198
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,160
TOM: Go on...?

199
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,680
Yeah, 'cos when you go past many fine Saxon churches,

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,940
what you find engraved on it is four holes
for you to hook the hooves in.

201
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,100
For a sheep.

202
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,780
It's twenty past Flossy.

203
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,180
That kind of thing.

204
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,980
Then they fall off, you get a goat,
causes all kinds of problems.

205
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,500
They have to be recalibrated with
a penny on their back every few rounds,

206
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,260
just to get them to within a few seconds.

207
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,760
MATT: So I was wrong.

208
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,960
TOM: Yes, you were.

209
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
It is a fairly standard clock.

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,520
There is something unusual about it,
particularly for that era,

211
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,420
that you would need to tell the time, day, night...

212
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,360
24-hour?

213
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,400
24-hour! Have a point. [DING]

214
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Absolutely right.

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,700
24-hour clock, so you would go there —
or she would go there,

216
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,100
would set her watch exactly, and then
go around to hundreds of clients...

217
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,560
Why didn't someone undercut her and just charge slightly less with a different watch?

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,840
Ah! And there you have stumbled upon something,
so I'll give you a point. [DING]

219
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
Oh, lucky me!

220
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,380
She came 'under attack from St John Wynne,
a director of the Standard Time Company.'

221
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,040
Standard Time!

222
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
'Twenty past three! Get out!'

223
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,100
What kind of criticism did he give
in a speech at the United Wards Club?

224
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,100
'Oh! I will not take time from a woman!'

225
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,860
'This is not a place for her!'
Something horrific like that?

226
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,540
You're close enough. [DING]

227
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,180
He said 'she might have been using her femininity...'

228
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,840
Eh?

229
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,820
TOM: Fe-mi-ni-ni-ty...
CHRIS: ...ni-ni-nin...

230
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,880
ALL: Femininininin...

231
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,140
'... to gain business.'

232
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,440
Oh, I see.

233
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,120
'D'you want to buy *my* time, luvvy?'

234
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,700
'Free some time?'

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,880
The speech was published in The Times...

236
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,860
Ayyyy!

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
[Applause]

238
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,240
With both of you doing that impression,
because I've got a very vivid imagination,

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,100
I've just got you in low-cut Victorian dresses
hanging round a pub in the East End...

240
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,760
and really I can't sleep for a fortni... oh no...

241
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,580
Hiya, luv...

242
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,040
Why are my hands still doing this?!

243
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,740
Augh!

244
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,300
So yes. Following the publication
of the comments, what happened?

245
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,500
She got really pissed off and threw her watch at him.

246
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,300
But it was on a chain, so she could keep doing it.

247
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,120
MATT: Is that like a yo-yo?

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
'Don't! Criticize! My! Timekeeping!'

249
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,000
I hope it had a bell in it,
so every time it hit him, it was like,

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Ding! Ding! Ding!

251
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,740
I just like the idea of,
'What time is it?'

252
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,460
'I've got no idea...'

253
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,460
'You want to know what time it is? It's whuppin' time!'

254
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,500
Er, quite the opposite, actually.

255
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,160
MATT: Nothing.
GARY: She took it in good humour.

256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,780
She did. It 'resulted in an increase in sales'. And, er...

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
[Laughter]

258
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,360
What did she say about his comments?

259
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,400
'T***.'

260
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
There was a little bit... a few more words in there —
Don't. Don't.

261
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,240
He'd just given her free advertising.

262
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,060
GARY: That's nails! Love that. Yeah.

263
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,180
'Er, excuse me, Miss.
I hear you provide... services of time...'

264
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,280
'I'd like to buy some of your... time.'

265
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,640
'All right. It's 2:30. There you go.'

266
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,380
'That wasn't quite what I had in mind.'

267
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,860
'But my watch is accurate now, so...'

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
'I can't say I lost from this transaction. Good day!'

269
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,800
Yes. She lived to the age of 89...

270
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,260
And she'd know that, 'cos she's got a watch.

271
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,980
She... how long did she have
before that for her retirement?

272
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,680
None at all. Because she'd just
keep going till she carked.

273
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,000
Close. But a little bit.

274
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,740
Twelve minutes exactly.

275
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,360
They found a watch on the body.

276
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
GARY: Till her w...

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,940
CHRIS: Come on then.

278
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,680
GARY: Matt Gray's dead. Here we go.

279
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,280
TOM: That's the look that means
this is about to hit the cutting room floor.

280
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,280
Everybody, roll up your sleeves. This one's coming.

281
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,980
[Rising]  Ohhhh...!

282
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,040
GO!

283
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,260
This is terrible!

284
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,280
Did she meet her untimely death at...?

285
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
[Groans]
[Cheering]

286
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,480
Oh, no! No!

287
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,120
That wasn't even the joke!

288
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
I hadn't noticed that! That was better!

289
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,700
I was going to say, did she die at the third stroke?

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
[Groans]

291
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,540
No, but she got three years of retirement.

292
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
GARY: Well, 1940 is Blitz.

293
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,460
I think that's the start of the Blitz.
So she's walking through Blitz-torn London,

294
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,200
telling the Nazzies to eff off while she's
walking around with a clock in her hand.

295
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,420
Hero!

296
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,500
Actually, yeah. 'It's teatime,
they'll be bombing in 15 minutes.'

297
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,940
How did she know that?!

298
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,580
Ohhh!

299
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Just putting it out there.

300
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,180
There is a reference to a buggy in here as well,
so I imagine there was something else...

301
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,740
She may have been riding...

302
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
GARY: She was on a go-kart?

303
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,600
TOM: 19th — a Victorian-era go-kart?

304
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,740
Oh come on, Gary. It's an iron scooter!

305
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,660
Ohhh.

306
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,000
Designed by Brunel himself!

307
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,260
And there...! First reference to Brunel... 20 minutes.

308
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,460
If you've got your bingo cards,
that must be a line by now, it really must.

309
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,080
Says the man in a Bob's Full House hoodie.

310
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,620
TOM: A reference which precisely thr...

311
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,080
TOM: ...one person in the audience —
thank you for that cheer — gets.

312
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,120
That's exactly the one in 400 people
this is aimed to appeal to.

313
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,960
As am I, let's face it.

314
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,540
So, when she retired...

315
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
after the generations of doing this,

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,440
and it was clear that this was not necessary any more,

317
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,100
because the Standard Time Company,
while they did not win, themselves,

318
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,300
technology moved on.
What was the Standard Time Company selling?

319
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,640
CHRIS: Substandard, shoddy time. Not collected
fresh from Greenwich every morning!

320
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,160
'Just send 'em yesterday's time.
It'll be fine, it's only slightly stale.'

321
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,200
GARY: Big buckets of time, lined up by the gates.

322
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,760
Filling it from the hand-pump of chronology!

323
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,140
CHRIS: 'There ye go.'

324
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,420
CHRIS: 'We've got some time back in the Devonian.'

325
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,580
CHRIS: Geology joke there...

326
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,320
GARY: I imagine time being dispensed sounds like,
[Blows raspberry]

327
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,080
Gary, that's how you imagine most noises.

328
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,540
Fair cop.

329
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,480
Actually, we may as well,
while we're doing bingo and Gary noises...

330
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,260
Goose!

331
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,340
[Honks]

332
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,520
Goose on a train!

333
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,180
[Two-tone train horn]
[Goose honk]

334
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
Goose being hit by a train.

335
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
[Train horn]
[Goose honk]

336
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,140
It's what they were all waiting for, Gary.

337
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,260
That's what you paid your money for. I know that.

338
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,640
What was the Standard Time Company selling?

339
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,820
How did they get their time to people?

340
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,780
I realize I'm treating time as a physical thing here.
How did they tell people the time?

341
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
MATT: Telephoning?

342
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,260
Nah.

343
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,260
Or telegramming? Or tele... communicating
in some kind of way on a wire?

344
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,440
TOM: ...there's a word. There's a word!

345
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,320
Telegraph! Morse code!

346
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,240
Text message!

347
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,100
TOM: [Strangled noise]

348
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,100
MATT: Skype!

349
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,120
[DING] Gary gets the point. It was a
'telegraphic time signal service',

350
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,540
But I'm giving Matt a point as well,
[DING] because he was *so* close.

351
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,760
GARY: Bulls***!

352
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,440
He got the idea, you got the word.

353
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,140
GARY: In mill towns, in t' north where we come from,

354
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,880
they'd go round, basically a man with a great big stick,

355
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,100
would just whack on the window to wake you up,

356
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,360
and that was the knocker-upper,
because he was the only one with a watch.

357
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,320
Yeah. He was the knock-her-upper.

358
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,360
[Laughter]

359
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Lots of kids that looked suspiciously similar,
if you know what I mean.

360
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,700
Yes, the Standard Time Company
sold a telegraphic time signal,

361
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,620
but by that point, we had radio, we had military time...

362
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,780
and the customers were starting to die out, essentially.

363
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,480
Did you have the speaking clock by then as well?

364
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
19...36, so it did exist.

365
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,320
There is one other signal at
the Royal Observatory in Greenwich...

366
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Obviously she went up, got it from the clock,
got it from the official source.

367
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,280
What happens every day at the
Royal Observatory on the top of the hill?

368
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,380
Someone gets their fingers trapped in a door
and yells, on the hour.

369
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,860
No one's ever got round to fixing it.

370
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,400
GARY: 'I'll just get the milk — ' BOOM.

371
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,420
GARY: 'AAGH! JESUS WEPT!'

372
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,860
Set the clock...

373
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,780
TOM: Where did that come from?!

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,360
Where does it all come from, Tom? I don't know.

375
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,860
No... 1 pm at the top of the hill in
Greenwich Park, a thing happens.

376
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,480
GARY: Somebody drops the balls!

377
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,760
Point! [DING]

378
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,380
[Tittering]
TOM: Do you want to explain that?

379
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,660
That sounded worse than in my head... yeah.

380
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,540
S***. Yeah. There's the time... ball, isn't there, that falls —

381
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,740
TOM: See, this is one of those things
that sounds rubbish, but actually isn't.

382
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,120
Thank you.

383
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,760
TOM: That's actually a good mime.

384
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,720
That's Lord Time himself there.

385
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,540
Do you want to explain the time ball?

386
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,280
MATT: Please explain.

387
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,980
I can't understand the time ball! It's a ball
on a stick that drops down at one o'clock.

388
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,720
Is it something like so ships on the River Thames

389
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,940
could synchronize their chronometers
before they set off,

390
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
on a sail, so they knew it was one o'clock?

391
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,920
A bit like the one o'clock gun in Edinburgh, where
they fire a big f***-off gun at the top of the castle,

392
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,900
to scare all the tourists, 'cos that's
what it's for these days, let's face it.

393
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,600
I was once at Edinburgh Castle...

394
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,760
Hold on.

395
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,540
[DING DING]

396
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,360
Thank you!

397
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,740
TOM: Carry on.
GARY: Thank you.

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,340
There's a third one needed.

399
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,860
I was once at Edinburgh Castle on holiday.

400
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,220
I was looking down through the telescope
as the one o'clock gun went off —

401
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,740
You see them bastards duck, down on Princes Street!

402
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,720
If you're ever in Vienna —

403
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,460
GARY: That means nothing to me.
MATT: [Sings] 'Oh, Vienna!'

404
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,340
They test the air raid sirens
in the city once a month still.

405
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,980
GARY: Ho ho!
CHRIS: Oooh.

406
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,580
Which I imagine is just to annoy tourists now.

407
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
GARY: Yeah.

408
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,260
Like, it's the three-minute warning,
the bomb's about to drop...

409
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,760
I want a helmet and to be able to run.

410
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,100
[Laughter]

411
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
Why are both those things unachievable for you?

412
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,780
Congratulations Chris, you win this one!

413
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,100
You win a gambling den for nocturnal birds of prey,

414
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,020
run by the star of the Godfather
from the back of a '59 Chevy.

415
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,520
GARY: Oh, Jesus Christ, no.

416
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,020
Someone just got that, I think.

417
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,880
It's Al Pacino's El Camino Owl Casino.

418
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,780
With that, we say thank you to... Chris Joel!

419
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,440
To Gary Brannan!

420
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,600
Matt Gray!

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,000
Bye-bye, studio audience!

422
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,980
We will see you in ten minutes after the interval!
