1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,320
The Vatican penned a secret deal

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,050
With the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,160
Now, the officially atheist Party

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,700
Can appoint Catholic Bishops in China

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,100
What does this mean for Chrisitans in China?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,480
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,039
Joining me today is Cardinal Joseph Zen,

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,800
the former bishop of the Catholic Church in
Hong Kong.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,499
He's been an outspoken defender of human rights
and has been called

11
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,590
the conscience of Hong Kong.

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,699
Thank you for joining me today.

13
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,699
Thank you.

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,039
So, for those watching, could you give us
an idea of

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,809
what it's like to be a Christian in China?

16
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:44,390
It's very complicated thing because in the
constitution

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,899
they say there is freedom for religion,

18
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:54,830
but actually you have to follow the directive
of the government.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:04,949
Recently, it seems that they are particularly
worried about

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,490
the so-called foreign religion,

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,630
especially the Christian religion.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,830
So, they have hard life.

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,280
We Catholics in China,

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,840
we have a big problem because we are split
into two communities.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,090
One, the so-called underground,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,110
those who want to keep their faith and refuse

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,590
to follow the directive of the party

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,240
because religion is not part of the party.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,340
There is another part, another community,

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,189
for any reason they thought it's okay to accommodate
and compromise,

31
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,570
and they follow the government.

32
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,180
Being separated into two community create
other problems.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,040
So, there's basically the state-run churches

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,780
controlled by the Chinese Communist Party

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,789
and those who worship underground, as you
say.

36
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,789
Yeah.

37
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,719
What kind of pressure do the underground Christians
face?

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,069
You see, China is so big so the situation

39
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,370
is different from place to place.

40
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,790
You can have a place where the underground
is the majority

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,620
or other places where they are the minority.

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,980
You may have a place where they can live in
a peaceful coexistence.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,450
Then you have other places where they fight
each other.

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,739
It's a very different situation.

45
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:49,409
Now, I make some important example, for example,
in Shanghai.

46
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,790
Shanghai is my native city.

47
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,780
In Shanghai you have both communities rather
strong.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,319
Then, they live almost peacefully together.

49
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,430
Then in other places,

50
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,060
you have high tension between the two parts.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:24,629
You see, before this agreement between Vatican
and Chinese government,

52
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,900
in several places like in Hubei,

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:38,209
in Sensi, in Fouken, in Wenzhou,

54
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,390
they have churches, buildings for the underground.

55
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,740
They are tolerated for a long time.

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,159
The government never give too much trouble
to them.

57
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,110
Surely, they are considered out of law,

58
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,040
but they are tolerated.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,989
There are buildings, even big buildings.

60
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:03,180
Why?

61
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,310
Because you suppose in the town you have

62
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,360
a great majority belonging to the underground
church,

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,110
and they are good people.

64
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,470
They work hard.

65
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,830
They behave.

66
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,440
In the town there is no robbery, no fighting,

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
so the local official are satisfied of the
people,

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,230
so they tolerate.

69
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,830
They are not making trouble.

70
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,640
That cannot happen in the big cities

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,110
because you have the foreigners,

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,350
so they cannot allow for churches or buildings,

73
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,470
otherwise they lose face.

74
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,290
There you have many priests who say mass on
Sunday,

75
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,160
and they have a big congregation in the private
house.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,230
See, the government, you know-

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,700
Turns a blind eye.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,310
Yeah, and everybody know.

79
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,460
It's no secret at all.

80
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,130
You see, it's a difficult situation,

81
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,830
but here you can survive.

82
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,630
Now it's much more difficult now.

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,460
It's gotten worse for Christians in China?

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,550
Oh worse, much worse.

85
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,260
Much worse.

86
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,080
This did not happen just overnight.

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,160
It's a long history because in the last,

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:36,620
say, 15, 20 years in the Vatican,

89
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,340
those who manage the business of church in
China,

90
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,720
they follow the wrong strategy.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,780
I was going to ask about that.

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,960
I know the Vatican has made a deal with China

93
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,050
that allows the Chinese Communist Party some
control

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,740
over appointing bishops in the Catholic churches
in China.

95
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,050
Why do you think the Vatican was pushing that?

96
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,350
I said it's a long history.

97
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,190
Those bishops in the official church,

98
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,750
are chosen by the government mostly.

99
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,430
Sometimes the Vatican sees that they are acceptable
people,

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,770
but sometimes I think they know very well

101
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,070
that those people are not fit to be bishops.

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,000
I think there's been cases where some of the
Communist Party

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,810
appointed bishops have families, children,
affairs.

104
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,290
Exactly, yeah.

105
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,841
Then, sometimes the Vatican refuse to approve,

106
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,150
but now recently they approved all those seven,

107
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,810
excommunicated bishops.

108
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,470
That's incredible.

109
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,960
Just for clarity,

110
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,300
bishops that the church previously excommunicated

111
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,680
because they were appointed by the Communist
Party.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah.

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,160
They are ordained, chosen by the government.

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,270
Ordained without permission from Rome,

115
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,900
so they were excommunicated.

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,020
Seven of them.

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,630
One died before.

118
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,630
There were eight,

119
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,960
but at that moment seven.

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,470
Then they say,

121
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,730
"Oh, they repented of their actions,

122
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,330
so now the Pope has lifted the excommunication.

123
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,080
The second step is to recognize them as bishops."

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,570
Now, it's okay to lift excommunication.

125
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,430
That's okay because you just have to show

126
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,740
a little repentance is enough,

127
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,220
but how can you appoint these people to be
bishops?

128
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,300
Incredible.

129
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,960
What is your main concern with

130
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,090
the Vatican's deal with the Chinese Communist
Party?

131
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,400
Now, first of all, they say the deal

132
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,960
is only about the selection of bishops,

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,760
appointment of bishops,

134
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,990
but it's a secret deal.

135
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,190
Why should it be secret?

136
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,190
Why?

137
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,770
Now, being secret,

138
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,130
we don't know anything,

139
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,650
and the people don't know how to behave.

140
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:17,150
Because now the government come to tell the
people

141
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,150
anything they like.

142
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,460
They said, "This is already approved by the
Pope."

143
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,060
Our people don't know whether it is true.

144
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,520
We know it is not true.

145
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,900
For example, they now come to tell the underground
priests,

146
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,620
"You have to come up now.

147
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,440
Join the association because the Pope already
has agreed."

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Now, it's not true, so the people doubt.

149
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,440
There is no word from the Vatican,

150
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,560
so why they don't make public the agreement?

151
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,020
They say, "Oh, it's provisional."

152
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,870
Okay, even provisional agreement can be public.

153
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,430
When you have to change or abrogate,

154
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,750
you can do that.

155
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,110
Now it is enforced, this one.

156
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,730
People should know what is agreement.

157
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,780
So, it's created a lot of confusion in the
churches in China.

158
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,610
Terrible, terrible, yeah.

159
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,880
Do you think the situation is getting worse?

160
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,650
Getting worse also because, you see,

161
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,710
the way the Vatican dealing with the official
church

162
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,060
is always so lenient.

163
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,080
Even before the agreement,

164
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,000
before approving those seven bishops,

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,900
they always try to please the government.

166
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,300
In this church,

167
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,420
many of the bishops even those approved by
the Vatican,

168
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,280
they are not good bishops.

169
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,400
They are what Pope Benedict used to call opportunists.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,500
They do the work for the government,

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,240
not for the church.

172
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,630
Sometimes the Vatican approved them

173
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,380
just because the pressure from the government.

174
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,000
Not because those people are found fit to
be bishops.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,850
With the recent agreement,

176
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,080
with the approval of the seven excommunicated,

177
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,150
now they are thinking triumph.

178
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,250
They are saying, "You see, we are made good
choice.

179
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,720
We are on the side of government.

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,530
The government is fighting for us.

181
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,460
Now we have the victory.

182
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,460
You stupid people.

183
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,020
You are still fighting in the underground,
so come on, join us."

184
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,190
Many are tempted to join.

185
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,460
That's [inaudible] church.

186
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,320
It's given the officially atheist Communist
Party

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,230
a lot more control over Christians and Catholic.

188
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,430
Yeah, ruining the church.

189
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,140
The government is ruining the church.

190
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Now, they are very clever.

191
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,580
They say, "No, no, no.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,450
We have the bishops conference.

193
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,620
We have the Patriotic Association.

194
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,130
They work together," but they are fake.

195
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,960
There's no real bishops conference.

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,590
I mean, there's a name,

197
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,090
but they don't have any power.

198
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,850
It's just sort of a show.

199
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,990
Sure.

200
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,560
There's no distinction between the Patriotic
Association

201
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,020
and the bishop conference.

202
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,320
They work always together,

203
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,630
but presided by the government official.

204
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,480
This is not Catholic Church.

205
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,080
It's a Communist Party church.

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Communist Party running church.

207
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,690
Now, do you feel like your criticisms of this,
of this deal,

208
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,021
do you think the Vatican has heard you?

209
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:55,840
You see, Pope Benedict did two wonderful things.

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:03,330
One is to write a letter, a wonderful letter,
12 years ago.

211
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,930
Wonderful letter.

212
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,060
Wonderful because really a masterpiece of
balance.

213
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,050
Very clear doctrine and also very open attitude.

214
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:23,620
But, incredible, the Holy See even dared

215
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,860
to manipulate the Chinese translation of letter.

216
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,630
Really?

217
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,690
Manipulate how?

218
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,260
First of all, there are many translation letter.

219
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,790
They are wonderful translation,

220
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,110
but Chinese translation is horrible.

221
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,260
Many mistakes.

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,350
I mean, mistakes because the translators

223
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,770
are not even competent in the language,

224
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,779
in the Italian language.

225
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,550
There is a point where it was not a mistake,

226
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,650
but it's a manipulation.

227
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,980
A manipulation in favor of the Communist Party?

228
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:18,370
No, a manipulation in favor of this surrender
to the Communist Party.

229
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:25,120
Because the question was, should the people
from the underground

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,380
come up and join the Patriotic Association?

231
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:36,510
Now, the answer is in principle there should
be no objection.

232
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,890
We are entitled to officiate publicly,

233
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,240
but in fact, in no few instances,

234
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,330
indeed almost always,

235
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,350
the government would put conditions

236
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,760
unacceptable to our Catholic conscience.

237
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:04,000
So, they omitted indeed almost always in a
very important point.

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,910
So, the Chinese translators let that part
out

239
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,290
to make it seem like Christians and Catholics
inside China

240
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,040
should just join the Communist Party run church.

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Wow.

243
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
That's a big manipulation.

244
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Terrible.

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Terrible.

246
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
It changed the whole thing.

247
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,420
It changed the whole thing.

248
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,040
They even refused to correct.

249
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,290
I got a few bishops and competent people

250
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,690
like the most famous biblical scholar.

251
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,450
He knows all the languages.

252
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,300
Then also the Rector of the Catholic University

253
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,180
to testify that there are mistakes there.

254
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,920
They refused to correct.

255
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Incredible.

256
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,070
Fortunately, there is an official who controls
all this.

257
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,990
When I told them there are mistakes, he said,

258
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,160
"Okay, if you have witnesses to prove that
there are mistakes,

259
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,279
we correct."

260
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,601
After one year, they correct it.

261
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,601
It's terrible.

262
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,601
It's terrible.

263
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:11,660
Then the second thing the Pope did is a wonderful
commission.

264
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,500
A commission of more than 30 people,

265
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,880
half of them from the Holy See,

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,170
half from this part.

267
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,490
From Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and China.

268
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,940
The commission worked for five years, but
you see,

269
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,470
the Vatican people, they always have the upper
hand.

270
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,800
So, they manipulate also there the working
of the commission.

271
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,470
Little by little, the commission could do
something.

272
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,510
There was plenty of opportunity to talk, to
discuss.

273
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,890
You just imagine the plenary session every
year lasts three days,

274
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,150
from morning to evening.

275
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,790
You can talk a lot.

276
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:13,510
So, it was making big progress, but you see,

277
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,410
the commission is called consultative.

278
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,750
It doesn't make decision.

279
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,211
That means the commission is supposed to

280
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:30,610
give advice to the Holy Father, and he decides.

281
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,140
But, the discussion of three days, so thick,

282
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,339
how can you supposed to read all that?

283
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,130
They rarely make any deliberation.

284
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,950
So, the real power still remains

285
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,010
with the officials of the Vatican,

286
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,200
and they don't tell the Holy Father

287
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,970
the whole reality of the meetings.

288
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,350
Terrible.

289
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,410
The only time we made a vote, clear motion,

290
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,559
still they just neglected it.

291
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,660
They went on their own way.

292
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,620
That's terrible.

293
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,270
When Pope Francis called this Parolin

294
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,760
to be the secretary of state,

295
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,970
and so the chairman of that commission,

296
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,840
he made that commission disappear.

297
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,540
No more meetings.

298
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Disappeared.

299
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,330
Not even a letter saying,

300
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,890
"Oh now, the commission has fulfilled its
historical role."

301
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,870
No, no, just disappeared.

302
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,380
Incredible.

303
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,990
What effect did that have?

304
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,590
No more dialog.

305
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,460
Our voice no more reach the Holy See.

306
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,870
No more.

307
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,080
Disappeared.

308
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,810
And, we had also an archbishop,

309
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,480
number two in the congregation.

310
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
They sent him away.

311
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,240
So, the commission disappeared.

312
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,030
We were so many experts.

313
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,700
They think they don't need our expertise.

314
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,230
They are discussing with China.

315
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,770
The Chinese are masters in playing with words.

316
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,950
Manipulation.

317
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,590
But they're happy to allow themselves to be
cheated.

318
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,580
That's the point.

319
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Incredible.

320
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,670
Thank you so much for joining me today.

321
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,540
It's been a pleasure.
