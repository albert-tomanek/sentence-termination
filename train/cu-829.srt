00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,810
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,150
these photos of the massive flooding in central
China are remarkable.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,010
Almost as remarkable as the level of corruption

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,950
that made this a mostly man-made disaster.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,740
Wuhan. The most populous city in central China.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,699
Once known as “the city of 100 lakes.”

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,550
Unfortunately, right now, it looks like one
giant lake.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,250
It’s thanks to some of the worst flooding
in China in over a decade.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,430
The worst part is,

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,480
the government is largely to blame

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,000
for making it much worse than just a normal
natural disaster.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
To give you an idea of how bad it is,

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,440
here are 7 photos of the devastation,

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,420
as I explain why this was a partly preventable disaster.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,760
Number 1

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,329
According to official statistics from the
Chinese government,

17
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,949
which are always so trustworthy,

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,920
more than 180 people have died

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,280
in the devastating floods affecting central
and South China.

20
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,900
And a super typhoon is on the way...

21
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,090
Number 2

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,509
Don’t worry though.

23
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,409
Top Chinese officials rushed to the scene.

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,049
Hmm, good question.

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,819
But perhaps the better question is where were
top officials

26
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:25,179
while corruption and overbuilding primed Wuhan
for this disaster?

27
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:26,529
Number 3

28
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:30,099
You know how I said Wuhan was known as the
city of 100 lakes?

29
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,539
Well, most of those lakes were filled in to
make room for construction.

30
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,069
Only about 40 were left.

31
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,490
Number 4

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,380
The city has been so built up,

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,359
there was nowhere for the water to go.

34
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,609
I don’t think this was supposed to be a
giant water polo stadium.

35
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,079
Number 5

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,419
But it wouldn’t have been so bad if, for
instance,

37
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:55,679
proper drainage systems had been put in place.

38
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,829
Number 6

39
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,200
Also, in 2013,

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
the Wuhan government said a nearly two billion
dollar 3 year project

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,630
would eliminate flooding by 2016.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,869
You can see how that turned out.

43
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:09,689
Why?

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,900
Corruption.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,739
Massive, massive corruption.

46
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,370
According to this report,

47
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,430
the local official in charge of a hundred-plus
million dollar dike construction project

48
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,409
was caught taking 240 thousand dollars in
bribes.

49
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,219
Two other officials were also charged.

50
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,819
Number 7

51
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,409
And one of the dikes that should have been
fixed in that project

52
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,340
just was breached during the flooding.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,540
And this is far from the first time corruption
has cost people lives in China.

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,640
An estimated nearly 70,000 people died in
the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Many were children who were crushed when their
schools collapsed.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,760
Local officials had been embezzling construction
funds

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,530
for the schools on a massive scale

58
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,680
and they used cheaper, lower quality building
materials instead.

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
It became known as “tofu construction.”

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,579
And back in 1998,

61
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:07,599
massive flooding killed 4,000 people.

62
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,540
The premier at the time, Zhu Rongji,

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,319
visited the site of a major dike in Jiangxi
province

64
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,239
that was breached because it wasn’t built
properly.

65
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,549
Zhu was reported as having said to the local
officials,

66
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,409
“How can you be corrupt to such a degree?”

67
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,640
As you can see in this BBC drone footage,

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,870
the devastation in Wuhan is severe.

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,189
But the people of Wuhan are getting by

70
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,629
despite the failures of their government.

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,510
Why not leave a word of support in the comment
section below

73
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,510
to the people in China suffering from these
floods?

74
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,400
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.
See you next time.
