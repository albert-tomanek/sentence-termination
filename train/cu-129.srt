1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,170
US companies have been hit

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,730
by a massive cyber-heist.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,900
Sensitive information from nearly 80 million
people

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,500
has been stolen.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,230
The Department of Justice thinks it knows
whodunit.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,690
Sophisticated hackers operating in China

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,120
But maybe the worst is yet to come

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,330
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,060
The United States has just indicted two Chinese
hackers

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,660
and charged them with cyber crimes.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,680
Very serious cyber crimes.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,439
The first alleged cyber-criminal:

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,649
Fujie Wang, aka Dennis Wang.

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,339
Here’s his wanted poster.

16
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,670
The second accused hacker:

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,389
Zhou Zhihong, aka Deniel Jack.

18
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,860
That’s right.

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,860
Deniel Jack.

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,789
Here’s his wanted poster.

21
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,429
Bringing him in is going to be hard.

22
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:51,109
There are a lot of lookalikes out there.

23
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,499
In an announcement last week,

24
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:56,239
the Department of Justice said Dennis Wang
and Deniel Jack

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,519
are members of an “extremely sophisticated
hacking group

26
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,100
operating in China and targeting

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,969
large businesses in the United States”.

28
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,850
The DOJ indicted the duo for a range of cyber
crimes

29
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,920
that include intentional damage to a protected
computer

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,780
and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

31
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,170
Their biggest of their several cyber-intrusions
dates back to 2015.

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,040
The target was a company called Anthem.

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,180
It’s one of the biggest health insurance
companies in the US.

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,370
Now you might think:

35
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,570
That’s just karmic justice for those big
insurance companies

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,399
ripping off Americans.

37
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,659
But the thing is,

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,880
the hackers weren’t after lower insurance
premiums.

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,030
They were after the sensitive personal data

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,560
of nearly 80 million customers—

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,829
including, maybe yours.

42
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,299
The indictment says the hackers

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,710
broke into Anthem's computer networks

44
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,409
using a bag of sophisticated tricks.

45
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,920
First, "spearfishing"—

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,420
where they targeted Anthem employees

47
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,579
with emails containing malicious hyperlinks.

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,210
Click the link and it automatically downloads...

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,210
"Malware"—

50
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,139
where they installed malicious software

51
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,530
that runs automatically and installs

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,380
a "backdoor"—

53
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,710
which is a tool that lets hackers control
a computer remotely.

54
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,039
It’s like when you get an email in weird
English,

55
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,290
promising you an “all expanses paid cruise
in Bahama”—

56
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,510
if you could please just click on this link.

57
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,569
And then they steal everything.

58
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,269
According to the indictment, Wang and Jack,

59
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,180
“collected files and other information

60
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,030
from the compromised computers and then stole

61
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,310
(i.e. exfiltrated) this data of interest using
encrypted archives

62
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,810
and computers under their control.”

63
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,300
And where did all that stolen data get exfiltrated
to?

64
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
China.

65
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,580
And what did all that stolen data contain?

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
Personally identifiable information

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,680
of some 78.8 million people,

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,510
including names, addresses,

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,849
income data and social security numbers.

70
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,189
So don’t be surprised if you start getting
personalized spam

71
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:58,070
from a guy selling knockoff whiskey.

72
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,450
But more seriously,

73
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,620
if the hackers decide to sell the data,

74
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,489
this could potentially be a huge opportunity
for identity theft.

75
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:08,970
According to the Social Security Administration,

76
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,360
identity thieves can use your social security
number

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,189
to get credit in your name

78
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,579
and "then they use the credit cards

79
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,760
and don't pay the bills."

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,770
Using credit cards and not paying the bills?

81
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,030
They’re even ripping off a traditional American
pastime!

82
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,159
So it's not just virtual spam pinging your
mailbox.

83
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,360
It could mean very real,

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,209
very physical debt collectors beating down
your door.

85
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,540
Although an Anthem spokeswoman

86
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,469
was quick to tell the Wall Street Journal
that

87
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,319
“There is no evidence that information obtained

88
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,520
has resulted in fraud.”

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,290
Does that mean the hackers stole data

90
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,469
on nearly 80 million people for no reason?

91
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,099
Or just not for fraud?

92
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,319
Because there’s also blackmail.

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,171
Anyway, just how bad is a data breach

94
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,500
involving nearly 80 million people?

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,370
Well, according to Assistant Attorney General
Brian Benczkowski,

96
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,700
“The brazen China-based computer hacking
group

97
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,469
committed one of the worst data breaches in
history."

98
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:08,790
One of the worst data breaches in history?!

99
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,379
Oh man, you hackers are in big trouble!

100
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,379
Just kidding.

101
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,379
They’re in China.

102
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,790
Don’t worry, the Chinese authorities

103
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,070
will soon find their secret hideout.

104
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,640
So they can send them bottles of champagne—

105
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,750
and a little note card thanking them

106
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,640
for their contribution to win-win mutual cooperation

107
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,730
with the United States.

108
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,860
Now, if this story sounds familiar, it is.

109
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,640
I’d call it, “Hackin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo.”

110
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,910
Back in December,

111
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,540
US prosecutors announced cyber-crimes charges

112
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,650
against two other Chinese hackers.

113
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,191
“Today the criminal justice department

114
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,860
is announcing criminal indictment of two hackers

115
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,710
associated with the Chinese government.

116
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,260
The charges include conspiracy

117
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,910
to commit computer intrusions

118
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,400
against dozens of companies in the United
States

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,230
and around the world.”

120
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,910
And FBI Director Christopher Wray said at
the time

121
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,570
that cyber threats from hackers

122
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,490
with links to the Chinese regime

123
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,580
are as bad as it gets.

124
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,430
“As evidenced by this investigation,

125
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,750
the threats we face have never been more severe

126
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,360
or more pervasive

127
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,900
or more potentially damaging to our national
security,

128
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,390
and no country poses a broader, more severe,

129
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,720
long term threat to our nation’s economy

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,260
and cyber infrastructure than China.”

131
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,160
What’s that, Shelley?

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
The US government also indicted

133
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,210
Chinese hackers in November 2018?

134
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,100
Ok, so this is more like Hackers Part 3:

135
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,980
Rise of the Machines.

136
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,480
What?

137
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,930
They also indicted Chinese hackers and spies

138
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,150
in October of 2018?

139
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,770
Ok, so this is more like the Kingdom of the
Crystal Hack,

140
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,220
the fourth sequel that no one asked for.

141
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,720
What’s that, Shelley?

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
The US government also indicted Chinese hackers
in 2017...

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
And all the way back in 2014,

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,550
when they indicted hackers who were actually

145
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,660
members of the People’s Liberation Army?

146
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,880
Forget it.

147
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,410
I’m done with this joke.

148
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,800
Only the Star Wars movies

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,100
have enough sequels to deal with this.

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
And believe me,

151
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,880
I’m ready for *that* series to be done.

152
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,800
I guess this is why the US government has
said

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,210
there’s a new “hacking spree” coming
from China.

154
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,180
But while these indictments might show that

155
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,550
the US government means business,

156
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,770
they also show that they’re not actually
good

157
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,660
at stopping the hacking.

158
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,420
So my advice is:

159
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,480
If you get an email in broken English,

160
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
with an attachment claiming to offer you

161
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
an all-expanses paid cruise—

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,810
don’t click on it.

163
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,810
So what do you think about

164
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,150
the cyber-crimes indictment

165
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,810
against Wang and Deniel Jack?

166
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,480
Leave your comments below.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
And while you’re here,

168
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,910
it’s time for me to answer another question

169
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,090
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

170
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,200
with a dollar or more per episode—

171
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,720
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

172
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,410
Colin Lee Bradford asks

173
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,110
“You seem desperate for questions sometimes.

174
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,150
What is your favorite type of question?”

175
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,940
My favorite questions are ones

176
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,820
where viewers ask about my favorite type of
thing.

177
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,610
Good question Colin.

178
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,650
And if you want your question

179
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,690
answered on the show,

180
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,470
go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored

181
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,280
and support us with a dollar or more per episode.

182
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,750
Then you can ask me about my favorite brand
of toothpaste,

183
