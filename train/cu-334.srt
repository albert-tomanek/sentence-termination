1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,880
China is holding Brazil hostage

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,920
After President Bolsonaro criticized the CCP.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
China’s “Vaccine Diplomacy”

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
is calculated terror.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,560
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,920
The coronavirus has become the greatest weapon\h\h

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,720
of the Chinese Communist Party. That’s one\h
reason I’ve been calling it the CCP Virus.\h

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
As I mentioned in the episode that came out a\h
few days ago, there’s growing evidence the global\h\h

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,200
pandemic that killed millions worldwide\h
accidentally leaked from a Chinese lab.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,880
The Communist Party spent the crucial first\h
6 weeks of the outbreak covering it up.\h\h

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,320
They used that time to hoard medical supplies.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,000
And now, the Chinese Communist Party is using\h
vaccine diplomacy to further strongarm the\h\h

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
world, particularly in Latin America.
The efficacy of Chinese vaccines is not high.\h\h

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,080
Especially compared to the other\h
first-generation coronavirus vaccines.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
But there aren’t yet enough high-quality\h
American and European vaccines for every\h\h

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,520
country, so a lot of countries have no choice\h
right now but to rely on Chinese vaccines.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,920
According to Jason Marczak, director of the\h
Latin American Center at the Atlantic Council\h\h

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,840
think tank, “From a public relations standpoint,\h
China has sought to shift the narrative from\h\h

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,080
China being at the center of the Covid problem to\h
China being at the center of the Covid solution.”

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,520
Which could very well be the greatest\h
turnaround in history. After Superbowl\h\h

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,880
51—when the Patriots were down 28-3 going into the\h
second half, and ended up winning it in overtime.

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,800
In other words, China’s\h
strategy is to be Tom Brady.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,240
Or more like Evil Tom Brady. Because\h
China’s plan for a turnaround\h\h

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,640
involves *selectively* giving out vaccines—only\h
to countries that do what Beijing wants.

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,960
Brazil is a great example.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
Brazil has been wary of giving\h
Chinese telecom company Huawei\h\h

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,960
access to the Brazilian market. You know,\h
because of serious security concerns.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,040
US Officials have said using Huawei technology\h
opens the door to Chinese spying and censorship.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
But with the Brazilian people\h
suffering from the CCP Virus,\h\h

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,720
President Jair Bolsonaro felt he had no\h
choice but to make a deal with China.

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,480
Back in January, in exchange for China speeding up\h
the procedures that would give Brazil the vaccine,\h\h

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Bolsonaro’s government signaled\h
it would allow Huawei to bid\h\h

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,440
in the 5G auction later this year. The\h
contract is worth around 30 billion US dollars.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,240
So Bolsonaro had to accept a\h
potential Chinese security threat\h\h

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,600
later, to stop a deadly Chinese virus now.

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
But it turns out, the deal\h
also comes with censorship.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,320
In May, President Bolsonaro seemingly criticized\h\h

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,360
China for taking advantage of the coronavirus\h
for its own gain. He said, “It is a new virus,\h\h

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,880
nobody knows if it was born in a laboratory or by\h
some human being that ate an inadequate animal.\h\h

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,760
But it is there. The military knows what\h
chemical, bacteriological and radiologic war is.\h\h

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Aren’t we facing a new war? Which country\h
grew its GDP the most? I won’t tell you.”

42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,840
He’s talking about China. Obviously. But come on,\h
a new war? Isn’t that a bit of an exaggeration?\h\h

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
No. Because China does see it as war.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Not long after Bolsonaro’s comments, China\h
stopped sending vaccine ingredients to Brazil.

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Brazil uses those vaccine\h
ingredients to make the final\h\h

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,640
vaccine that it distributes to its population.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,680
But with China cutting these ingredients off,\h\h

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,880
it puts Brazil in a dangerous situation.\h
Especially as Brazil’s Covid death toll spirals.

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,240
Only about 7% of Brazilians have been fully\h
vaccinated. More than 420,000 Brazilians have\h\h

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,840
died. Again, from a disease the Chinese\h
Communist Party is responsible for.\h\h

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Possibly for a lab leak, and certainly for their\h
6-week coverup that allowed it to spread globally.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,680
So the Communist Party is taking advantage of\h
Brazil’s desperation for the vaccine. A rival\h\h

53
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,560
to Bolsonaro, São Paulo’s Governor João Doria,\h
criticized Bolsonaro’s government saying, “How can\h\h

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,040
they attack those who supply us with raw materials\h
and vaccines to save Brazil’s population?”

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,480
I bet China likes this guy. Maybe he could be\h
the next president! Doria also said he spoke\h\h

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,440
with Brazil’s Chinese Ambassador who said, “[The\h
Sinovac] raw material is ready and available\h\h

57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,960
in refrigerated containers, just waiting for\h
the authorization of the Chinese government.”

58
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,840
In other words, there is no shortage\h
of ingredients for the Chinese vaccine.\h\h

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,840
The Chinese government is just\h
sitting on it until Brazil begs.

60
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,480
And Governor Doria begged.

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,200
So after Doria met with Chinese officials,\h
China released a new batch of vaccine supplies.

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,560
And this is how the Chinese government is forcing\h
Brazil to play its game. With moves like that,\h\h

63
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,760
no wonder it can pull an Evil Tom\h
Brady and win every Superbowl.

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,640
And this isn’t just happening in Brazil.

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,440
It’s happening all over Latin America.

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,080
“Latin American officials say China\h
has pushed their countries to cut\h\h

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
ties with Taiwan in return for\h
badly needed Covid-19 vaccines.”

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Only a handful of countries in the world still\h
recognize Taiwan as a country. China is trying\h\h

69
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,720
very hard to change that. Since 2017, three\h
Latin American countries—Panama, Dominica,\h\h

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
and El Salvador—have broken ties with Taiwan\h
in favor of China. That’s because “China has\h\h

71
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,080
invested in ports, roads, dams and railways, often\h
offering loans to Latin American governments,\h\h

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
and made big purchases of minerals\h
and agricultural commodities.”

73
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,800
But countries like Honduras and Paraguay, which\h
still recognize Taiwan, don’t get all that nice\h\h

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,360
economic development. And guess which countries\h
aren’t getting Chinese coronavirus vaccines now?\h\h

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
Unless of course, they cut ties with Taiwan.

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,560
Now keep in mind, China is not donating\h
these vaccines. They’re selling them. Yeah,\h\h

77
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
when you get the world sick and then sell\h
them a cure, you can make a lot of money.

78
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,280
And this is what’s at stake\h
if the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,120
dominates global supply chains. It can hold\h
the world hostage to its political demands.

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
And now is the time when I answer\h
a question from one of our fans.\h\h

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,600
Normally, I take a question\h
from our supporters on Patreon.

82
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
But today, I want to give a special\h
thank you to the folks who watch our new\h\h

83
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,360
Portuguese channel. Yes, we have a\h
Portuguese channel. The link is below.

84
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
And so today I’ll answer a question\h
from one of our Portuguese-speaking\h\h

85
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
YouTube subscribers in Brazil.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Daniel H P Carvalho asks:
“Hello Chris. In what ways do you think\h\h

87
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,480
Brazil can help in the fight against China? I know\h
that China depends a lot on exports from Brazil\h\h

88
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,320
to feed its population. Could this dependency\h
be useful for Brazil as a negotiation tool?”

89
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,840
Good question, Daniel.

90
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
China does depend on Brazil,\h\h

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
especially on soybeans. About three quarters\h
of China’s soybean imports are from Brazil.

92
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,640
But that’s not good enough leverage\h
for Brazil. The Chinese Communist\h\h

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,360
Party is always willing to endure\h
short-term losses to punish others.

94
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,240
For example, a few years ago, after\h
the trade dispute with President Trump,\h\h

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,120
China tried to punish American farmers\h
by cutting off American soybean imports.

96
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,840
And then China increased imports from Brazil.\h
In other words, Brazil is just a pawn to them.

97
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,120
The key to not being China’s pawn\h
is to not play their game at all.

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,040
Brazil is a great country, and it was great\h
before it started working with the Chinese\h\h

99
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,600
Communist Party. The key for Brazil is to build\h
up its own manufacturing economy, and to work with\h\h

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,560
trusted allies—and gradually reduce dependence on\h
China in all respects. If the Brazilian government\h\h

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,440
continues to deepen its relationship with China,\h
Brazilians will become less and less free. You’re\h\h

102
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
already losing your freedom to Chinese-imposed\h
censorship. And that’s just the beginning.

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
So the best way Brazilians can help\h\h

104
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,400
is to vote for politicians who will\h
stand up to the Chinese Communist Party.

105
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
Thanks for your question, Daniel.

106
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
And thank you for watching. And please, tell\h
everyone you know who speaks Portuguese to\h\h

107
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
check out our new Portuguese channel, run by\h
my colleagues in Brazil. The link is below.

108
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:49,840
I’m Chris Chappell. Thanks\h
for watching China Uncensored.
