00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,770
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,770
I'm rubber and you are...

3
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,030
one of the most powerful politicians in the
world!

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,050
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored, I'm
your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,390
Did everyone have a good Labor Day?

6
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,010
I spent mine at the half-off Ray Ban sale.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,140
But while the rest of America was taking one
last trip to the beach,

8
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,320
President Obama was hard at work

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,680
at the G20 summit in scenic Hangzhou, China.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,580
What makes it scenic is that you can actually
see it.

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
Unlike in other Chinese cities,

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,280
where you can measure smog by the pound.

13
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,520
In fact, the Hangzhou government recently
issued a reminder

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,350
to visitors from other parts of China:

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,350
no need to worry,

16
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,250
that big ball of fire in the sky is just the
sun.

17
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,860
So President Obama was in Hangzhou for the
G20 summit,

18
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,369
which is the annual meeting of leaders of
the world's 20 biggest economies.

19
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,599
China's state-run media declared the summit
a huge success,

20
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,619
and proved it with a slideshow of Xi Jinping

21
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,799
shaking hands with other world leaders.

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,860
I know they're trying to make Xi Jinping look
powerful,

23
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,420
but I gotta say, with every photo,

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,040
he looks more and more like he has to pee.

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,860
It's because it's Japan.

26
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,400
And it was also a success according to this
Reuters article,

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,730
because "open confrontation [was] largely
avoided."

28
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,670
Setting the bar pretty low there.

29
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,129
That's like saying Thanksgiving was a success
this year

30
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,469
because Aunt Marge didn't get drunk

31
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,519
and accuse Uncle Al of making her give up
her dreams of being an artist...again.

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,500
The success of the G20 is good news for the

33
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,501
Chinese authorities,

34
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:06,129
who congratulated themselves on their speed
gentrification of Hangzhou.

35
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,750
They made the city appear clean, upwardly
mobile, and harmonious.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,470
Clean, by shutting down factories to reduce
pollution;

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,620
Upwardly mobile, by forcing millions of poor
migrant workers to leave the city;

38
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,529
and harmonious by arresting human rights activists.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,210
Thereby solving all of China’s fundamental
problems.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,980
After all, if you can’t see it, it doesn’t
exist.

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
Which is the way I approach my student loan
debt.

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,940
We got a lot of people who can relate to that.

43
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,040
Why was the Chinese regime so hung up on having
the summit be perfect?

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,519
Hosting prestigious international events

45
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,049
is part of their decades-long push for increasing
their "soft power."

46
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,409
No, that's not the last man standing in a
pillow fight.

47
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,391
“Soft power” is projecting a positive
image of China

48
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:15,879
that will get them increasing influence and
respect on the global stage.

49
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,559
Like when Kanye West says he’ll stop being
a douchebag.

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,800
Hey, that’s a hygienic product and a compliment.

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,030
But it didn’t go totally smoothly for China.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,460
When President Obama landed in Hangzhou for
the G20,

53
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,610
he couldn’t get off the plane,

54
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,990
because someone forgot to bring—the stairs.

55
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,150
That made it look like China was snubbing
the US,

56
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,530
which Chinese officials deny.

57
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,860
And I actually believe them,

58
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,199
because forgetting to take passengers off
the plane happens all the time.

59
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,159
Anybody here ever fly into Newark?

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,419
But hey, Obama was cool with that,

61
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,910
he just went out the cargo bay door.

62
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,560
"I'm out of here in ahhh 6 months.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,240
I could give ahhh diddly, ahhh squat."

64
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,860
And that would have been fine...

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,830
except that US reporters went to go watch
Obama getting off the plane.

66
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,750
And they were stopped by Chinese authorities.

67
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,880
And when the reporters protested,

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,590
one Chinese official shouted,

69
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,280
"This is our country, this is our airport."

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
And then US Secret Service was like,

71
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,919
well, your airport sucks.

72
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,199
And then the Chinese Ministry of State Security
was like, your face sucks.

73
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,060
And then the US State Department was all like

74
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,449
“Fine, China, we won't sit with you at the
G20 lunch table.

75
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,710
And neither will Germany or France.”

76
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,979
Obviously that last part was a joke.

77
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,979
It would never get that ridiculous.

78
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,939
And we wouldn't have actual government agencies
getting involved.

79
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,300
Actually, Chris--

80
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,379
What’s that Shelley?

81
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:31,219
Well, the US Defense Intelligence Agency actually did respond

82
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,130
They Tweeted: "Classy as always China."

83
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,340
Haha, that's a pretty good one.

84
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,190
That's not a joke, Chris.

85
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,410
I've got the tweet right here.

86
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Wow.

87
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,720
I guess global politics really is like middle
school.

88
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,720
How did Chinese officials respond?

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,760
Luckily, Twitter is banned in China.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,060
Right, if you can't see it, it doesn't exist.

91
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,229
The point is:

92
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,190
there was some controversy at the G20.

93
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,860
In fact, the diplomatic fight inspired the
Globe and Mail

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,500
to publish this article

95
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,139
about how the cracks are showing behind China's
soft power push.

96
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,979
China spends an estimated 10 billion dollars
a year on external propaganda.

97
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,810
But the Globe and Mail says the rest of the
world isn't so impressed anymore.

98
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,740
They quote China experts comparing China today

99
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,300
to South Africa during apartheid.

100
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,620
The say China's government is much
worse now than it was five years ago.

101
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,520
According to the article,

102
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,000
2016 China is so different from the China
of 2008,

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,060
which\h"held the world spellbound with the
sweep of its modernization,

104
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,700
the skill of its planners

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,920
and the competitiveness of its athletes.

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,940
Yes, 2008 China was so dreamy.

107
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,820
But then it put on some weight,

108
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,340
grew a beard and kept hanging out with supermodels
nearly half its age.

109
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,320
But here's the truth about 2008 China.

110
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,520
The one that supposedly held the world spellbound.

111
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Here's how the Chinese government

112
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,920
prepared for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,500
They guaranteed that the city would be clean,
modern, and harmonious.

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,980
Clean by shutting down factories to reduce
pollution;

115
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,240
modern, by demolishing half a million homes
and displacing more than a million people;

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,780
and harmonious, by arresting human rights
activists.

117
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,880
Sound familiar?

118
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,740
Look, it's not that the Chinese regime

119
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,500
has suddenly and unexpectedly gotten worse.

120
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,380
It's been bad for a long time.

121
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,460
But they were just better at hiding it,

122
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,960
and most of us honestly weren't paying that
much attention.

123
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,140
I mean, we didn’t even have China Uncensored
back then,

124
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,320
so how could you have known about it?

125
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,480
So it may seem like if you can't see it, it
doesn't exist.

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,400
But the good news is that now,

127
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,960
more and more, we can see it.

128
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,140
Just like the air in Beijing.

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,380
So what do you think of the G20 and China's
soft power push?

130
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,720
Leave your comments below.

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. See you 
next time.
