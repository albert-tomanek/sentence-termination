1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,149
A Chinese stand-up comedian

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,740
says something “sexist”.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,510
And it stirs a dangerous debate across China.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,360
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,300
Amidst all of the chaos of this past year,
there has been one steadily rising power within

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,280
China. No, I’m not talking about Chinese
leader Xi Jinping’s pants. Although they

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,380
continue to be quite high.\h

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,790
I’m talking about China’s entertainment
industry. There’s a growing trend of TV

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,860
shows featuring singing competitions, dance
competitions, and even rap competitions.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,739
Now, you might ask: How can you have artistic
expression under an authoritarian regime that

11
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,220
works to silence its people and squash the
slightest sign of rebellion? Too much freedom

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,160
of expression can be dangerous.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Well, don’t worry. Because glorious leader
Xi Jinping has figured it out.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,310
In 2014, Xi gave a speech saying China should
be careful about what kind of foreign entertainment

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,740
gets promoted. He said, “Many art forms
from overseas, such as hip-hop, breakdance,

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,009
etc... should only be adopted if the masses
approve of them, while also endowing them

17
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,979
with healthy, progressive content.”

18
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:34,439
So basically... Xi Jinping Thought on Breakdancing
with Chinese Characteristics?

19
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,609
Well, kind of. What Xi Jinping actually meant
was that he wants to use foreign culture to

20
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:48,099
spread the Communist Party’s message. Which
is why we see things like this: A rap song

21
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,850
from Chinese state-run television about China’s
Reforms, featuring Xi Jinping!

22
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,850
“To rule the party strictly we must harden
our bodies, the judicial reform must be victorious”

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,850
“All corruption must be punished. Every
corrupt official must be prosecuted.”

24
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,560
\h“The reform group is two years old; it
has done quite a lot.”

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,679
Yes, how do you do, fellow kids?

26
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:07,649
So Chinese authorities are allowing foreign
art forms into China’s entertainment industry.

27
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,610
It’s a way for them to get the Party’s
message across to young, impressionable minds.

28
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,370
But there’s a potential pitfall: Young,
impressionable minds.

29
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,100
That’s why entertainment shows in China
are still closely monitored by the Communist

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,400
Youth League.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,750
“Ultimately, the authorities still set China’s
cultural agenda, but the work of actually

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,720
realizing this agenda is increasingly decentralized.”

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,250
And as more producers and artists start opening
up this new market, it’s become less clear

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:48,230
what is and isn’t allowed on, say, a nationwide
broadcast. Or a nationwide streaming platform.\h

35
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,129
This is the case for stand-up comedy competition
“Rock & Roast”.

36
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,260
The show premiered on Tencent Video, a streaming
platform that belongs to tech conglomerate

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,980
Tencent.

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:07,230
Last year, one of the Rock & Roast finalists,
Yang Li, did a stand up comedy routine...for

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,600
which she was reported to China’s National
Radio and Television Administration. Why?

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Well, here’s one netizen who reported her
for, among other things, “alleged acts of

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,930
sexism, many instances of hostile discrimination
against males, and incitement of conflict

42
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,200
among the masses.” And that is “detrimental
to the harmonious development of China’s\h

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
socialist society.”
￼

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Well, I’ve got to hand it to this netizen.
They know the vocabulary.

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,069
So what did Yang Li say that was so detrimental
to the harmonious development of China’s

46
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,069
socialist society?\h

47
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:56,750
“Men are so wonderful and so mysterious.
You can never figure out what’s going on

48
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:07,860
in that little brain. Like, how can a guy
seem so average, and still have so much self-confidence?”

49
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,870
Well, I know she’s not talking about me.
Because I’m definitely not average.\h

50
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,560
Now her punchline doesn’t appear to be very
radical. It’s not even very funny.

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,819
Not that my jokes are much better. Which I
assume is why Tencent never invited me to

52
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,610
perform on Rock & Roast.

53
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,110
Now despite a rather unoriginal punchline,
it stirred up a big debate on Chinese social

54
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,610
media—over sexism. Clips of her standup
performance were shared across Chinese social

55
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,189
media, and it sparked a movement of women
speaking up about their individual experiences

56
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,990
facing sexism in Chinese society.

57
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,569
Obviously, something needs to be done to stop
these women.

58
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,680
But despite people reporting her to the higher-ups,
China’s National Radio and Television Administration

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,340
hasn’t done anything yet. Probably because
they don’t view Yang as a threat to the

60
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:11,819
Party’s agenda. But she is getting a lot
of blowback from Chinese netizens. Male netizens.

61
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,370
Including vicious attacks from people like
law professor Chu Yin at the University of

62
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,189
International Relations in Beijing.

63
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:28,130
You think you’re such a pretty princess.
You don’t have the life of a princess, yet

64
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,259
you have princess disease. You should get
that checked. It’s all a made-up fairy tale

65
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,529
from corporate minds commercializing on trends...You
think you’re a proud pretty princess, but

66
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,509
the reality is you’re just a corporate society
brainwashed leek.

67
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,639
Wow, that’s...really uncalled for. I’m
pretty sure the problem in China is not brainwashing

68
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,249
from *corporate* society.

69
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:53,550
Meanwhile, Yang isn’t afraid of the attacks.
She’s standing by her words.

70
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,050
“I can understand why people are lashing
out at me. Because they think a comedian’s

71
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,423
perspective is a reflection of their personality,
but that’s not it, I’m merely reflecting

72
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:11,160
what the audience is thinking. My comedy bit
got such a big response, only because it resonated.”

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,400
In response to one of her haters, she posted
on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter,\h“If

74
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,379
you don’t find it funny, then don’t watch
it, thank you. Try doing something more worth

75
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,039
your time. You have the guts to attack an
entertainment figure, but that’s just part

76
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,499
of the job. How about instead try to offend
people with power, offend the politicians,

77
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,710
offend the criminals.”

78
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,469
Is that an invitation or a death wish? Because
if someone went on television and actually

79
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:43,970
offended the people in power and the politicians...I
don’t think it would be just middle-age

80
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,030
professors attacking them.

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,150
Let’s just say Rock and Roast is not going
to roast Xi Jinping anytime soon. Or Rock

82
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,970
and Roast will quickly find themselves between
Rock and Hard Place.

83
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,931
But of course, making jokes about people in
power is the essence of good comedy. Some

84
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:09,479
people have even based their entire career
on that...(pause of self-reflection) I hope

85
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,009
it works out for them.\h

86
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,090
And that’s why people are warning Yang Li
to tread lightly—if she wants to veer into

87
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,560
socio-political topics. Who knows where this
will go?

88
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,319
Though for the most part, there has been a
positive response to Yang. People give her

89
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,380
career full support, saying that for there
to be a true stand-up comedy show in China,

90
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,430
the topics need to be more open.

91
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,699
But just how open can it be? It’s one thing
to talk about sexism. And sure, that attracts

92
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,770
a lot of attention on social media—because
that’s one of the things that people in

93
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,770
China *are* allowed to debate openly.

94
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,279
But if a person speaks her mind on political
topics, she might find herself whisked away

95
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,029
to get “re-educated.”\h

96
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:02,229
Of course, if everyone in China speaks their
mind, there’ll be no way to stop the tide.

97
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,080
I mean, how many re-education camps can there
be, right?

98
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,479
What’s that Shelley? There’s 500 in just
one region?!

99
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,020
OK, nevermind. It’s gonna be an uphill battle.

100
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,099
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of our fans who supports China Uncensored

101
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:30,020
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.
You can support the show too at patreon.com/ChinaUncensored,

102
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,660
and I might answer your question at the end
of an episode.

103
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,720
Jon Gilmour asks “Are you going to SHAVE
YOUR BEARD OFF?”

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,450
Why would I shave my beard off? Sure, having
a beard means I may not look like a traditional

105
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,140
news anchor, but if that’s what the people
wanted, then Matt would be hosting China Uncensored.\h

106
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:58,380
That’s not what the people want. The people
want the beard. Wisdom springs from the roots

107
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:07,020
of this beard, Jon. Confucius had a beard.
Abraham Lincoln had a beard. Chuck Norris

108
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,710
has a beard.

109
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,553
I think you see my point here, Jon. And if
you don’t, I’m going to have to report

110
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:20,550
you to the National Radio and Television Administration
for hostile discrimination against my beard.\h

111
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,080
Thanks for your question. And thank you for
watching China Uncensored. Don’t forget
