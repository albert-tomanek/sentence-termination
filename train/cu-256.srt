1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,650
Ah, Chinese New Year.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,060
Time for family,

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,060
dumplings!

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,060
And crazy...

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,560
insane...

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,680
travel.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,980
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,980
For most Americans,

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,300
the words “spring festival” and “insane
crowds”

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,900
mean one thing—

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,990
SPRING BREAK, BABY!

13
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,140
But in China, those words mean much bigger
crowds,

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,200
And sliiiightly less fun.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Because every year,

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,989
China is home to the world’s largest

17
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,940
seasonal human migration.

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,760
It’s the annual travel frenzy around Chinese
New Year.

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,010
These days in mainland China,

20
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,059
they call it the Spring Festival.

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,579
Not because Chinese people in February

22
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,690
are weirdly optimistic about spring,

23
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,210
But because, like many traditional things
in China,

24
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,239
the Communist Party changed the name to make
it

25
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,930
less about those old feudal superstitions,

26
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,219
and more about the kind of messages they can
control.

27
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,149
Anyway, Chinese New Year this year is February
5.

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,359
And 2019 is the year of the pig.

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,809
Or if this is your zodiac year,

30
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,450
you can call it the year of the boar,

31
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,689
which sounds way cooler.

32
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:09,950
But no matter what the year,

33
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,869
the Chinese New Year holiday is accompanied

34
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,170
by a massive travel rush that lasts about
40 days.

35
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,680
It’s called Chunyun,

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,600
which means Spring Festival travel season.

37
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,970
This year, between January 21 and March 1,

38
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,520
Chinese people will make nearly 3 billion
trips—

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,080
by planes...

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
trains...

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
and automobiles.

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Wow.

43
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Compared to that,

44
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,710
a few days with John Candy doesn’t sound
so bad.

45
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,240
The main reason for the ginormous travel crowds

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
is China’s migrant workers.

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
About 270 million people have migrated

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,890
from the countryside to the cities to find
work—

49
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,310
in factories, construction, etc.

50
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,090
Understandably, a lot of them want to

51
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,869
go back to their hometowns to visit family.

52
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,620
And pretty much everyone in China gets the
same dates off.

53
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,310
So this puts a big strain on China’s infrastructure.

54
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,340
Tickets for buses, planes and trains can be
really

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,409
hard

56
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,760
to get.

57
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,939
About a decade ago,

58
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,590
the Chinese government launched Operation
Sky Sword—

59
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,620
Clearly not a new Zelda game.

60
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,400
It is a huge campaign

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,900
to fight fake train ticket scalping

62
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,890
in Guangzhou, one of China’s busiest transit
hubs.

63
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,879
The situation has improved a bit since then.

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,580
Especially since the introduction of high
speed trains.

65
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,200
Chinese authorities even launched

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,700
10 new railways at the end of 2018

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,760
to deal with this year's travel rush.

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,660
They’ve also started new ploys

69
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,430
to make the insanity more bearable,

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,730
like service robots that serve of water

71
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,810
to travelers at train stations and,

72
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,040
you know, probably scan your face to keep
tabs on you,

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,410
but hey the water’s free!

74
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,459
Or a train station symphony orchestra

75
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,850
to serenade travelers with on-message music
and songs;

76
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,590
Or train station dance performances that definitely
don’t feel forced.

77
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,640
But even with improvements,

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,349
it’s still miserably crowded.

79
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:01,940
But that’s the price Chinese people

80
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,129
have to pay to get home for the holidays.

81
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,569
Whether they’re in Chongqing,

82
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:06,569
Nanjing,

83
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,569
Xian,

84
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,569
Shanghai,

85
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,700
or Beijing.

86
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,890
So as China rings in the Year of the Pig,

87
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,970
spare a warm thought for

88
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,470
the hundreds of millions of people

89
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,660
trying to make it home for the holidays,

90
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,800
and for the old

91
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
the young

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,140
and the very young

93
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,160
as they try and survive the 2019 travel madness.

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,610
And the watchful gaze of big brother.

95
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,049
So how would you make the Chinese New Year
travel madness

96
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,420
a little easier to bear?

97
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,489
Leave your comments below.

98
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,599
And before we go,

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,629
it’s time to answer a question from a fan

100
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,000
who supports China Uncensored

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,959
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,909
Reventon Arch asks:

103
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,670
“Why the beard Chris?”

104
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,640
I think this speaks for itself.

105
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,190
Thanks for your question, Reventon.

106
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,720
And thank you to all my fans

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,450
