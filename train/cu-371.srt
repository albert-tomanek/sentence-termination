00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,850
Looking for the perfect man?

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,600
You’ve found him!

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,430
No, not me, but thank you.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,190
It’s the latest Chinese dating simulator.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,300
And it’s got Chinese women swiping right.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,939
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,200
China has a gender problem.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
And not just because there are too many men.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,320
There’s also too much competition...

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,300
from virtual boyfriends.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,760
It’s dating simulator Love and Producer.

14
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,899
Which is a name that totally makes sense.

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,010
You play as a female TV producer

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,470
struggling to save your

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,179
late father’s production company,

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,879
while falling in love with these

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,210
four heartthrobs.

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,600
Zhou Qiluo, the carefree pop icon.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,629
Bai Qi, the police officer

22
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,579
that makes you feel safe.

23
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,899
Xu Mo, the genius scientist,

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,539
as smart as he is sensitive,

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,350
and Li Zeyan, the successful CEO.

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,479
Oh Li Zeyan, you can be the lord of my world
any day.

27
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,040
Wait, why is he pulling a gun on me?

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,210
Wow, dating simulators are intense.

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,790
Which I’m obviously just discovering

30
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,869
because I’ve never played one before.

31
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,250
This game, Love and Producer,

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,909
“has accumulated more than 2 million

33
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,000
daily active users

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,060
since its launch in December,

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,490
with the overwhelming majority

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,560
being females in their early 20s.”

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,619
Of course winning in love isn’t easy.

38
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,649
You see, in the game,

39
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:36,490
men are attracted to purple diamonds.

40
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,820
Just like in real life.

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,450
So if you want to go on a date with

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,530
one of these eligible bachelors,

43
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,530
you need to give them

44
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,659
one of your purple diamonds.

45
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,659
You can get them either by completing

46
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,009
in-game missions,

47
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,009
which is hard—

48
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,820
or, the much easier way,

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,770
using real money to buy them.

50
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,890
And Chinese women have spent

51
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,990
around 32 million dollars on it.

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,290
It’s hard to underscore

53
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,539
just how successful this game has been

54
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,159
with Chinese women.

55
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,829
But perhaps this will give you an idea.

56
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,469
Fans of my favorite character,

57
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,469
Li Zeyan,

58
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,930
who has the superpower to freeze time,

59
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,280
in case you were wondering—

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,680
well, his fans spent almost 40 thousand dollars

61
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,250
to have this happy birthday message

62
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,810
written on the side of a skyscraper in Shenzhen.

63
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,400
That’s a wonderful gift.

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
For the people who created the dating simulator.

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
So what do you think of the obsession

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,330
with Love and Producer?

67
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,980
Leave your comments below.

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,970
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

69
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,580
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,800
see you next time.

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,100
Let me guess,

72
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,080
you think that app should have the option

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,780
to give a purple diamond

74
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,270
to a fun-loving TV host from New York, right?

75
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,130
Well if you want more of me,

76
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,640
