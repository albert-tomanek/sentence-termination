On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,120
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,259
Wow, a bombshell has been dropped!

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,480
Check out what the Queen of England was caught
saying on camera

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,750
about the Chinese officials that recently
visited.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,980
“They were very rude to the Ambassador.”

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,990
Chinese officials were very rude.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,960
Now keep in mind,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,779
the British are known for their subtly,

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,420
so let’s listen to that again translated
into American English.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,309
“Those BEEP Chinese were BEEP to the BEEP
Ambassador.

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,500
BEEP.”

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,180
Now this is shocking.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,700
Not only because of the so-called “golden
age” of China-UK relations that’s supposedly begun,

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,879
based around 62 billion dollars worth of new
business deals

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,550
but also because the Queen never comments
on anything.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,820
How did China respond?

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,699
Well, to prove how not rude they are,

20
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,899
a state-run Global Times editorial called Western media “barbarians,”

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,440
who “will make progress” as they get more exposure to China’s 5,000 years of continuous civilization.”

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,930
Though in defense of Chinese officials,

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,530
which is not a phrase I ever thought I’d
say,

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,900
isn’t everyone rude compared to the Queen?

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,799
So what do you think about the Queen’s comments?

26
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,210
Leave your comments below.

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,000
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
