00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:02,280
Bitcoin crashes

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,229
After yet another Chinese crackdown

3
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:14,919
How much power does China have over crypto?

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:29,560
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,949
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,160
This episode is sponsored by PC-Doctor Toolbox.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,700
Protect your PC from software crashes, hardware
failures, and the kind of glitches that make

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,680
your life miserable.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,600
Speaking of crashes, Bitcoin!

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,760
After hitting a mid-April high of 65,000 dollars,
the price of bitcoin tumbled below 30,000

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
dollars.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,350
And China is to blame.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,080
You see, the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t
like Bitcoin.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,940
For one, the Party can’t control it.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,360
And for two, the Chinese regime is spending
big to create its own digital currency.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,130
Which it would control.

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,729
Ironically though, China is where most of
the bitcoin mining happens, particularly here

18
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,259
in Sichuan Province.

19
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:20,200
Basically, enormous computer banks are used
to verify bitcoin transactions, and you get

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,900
rewarded with bitcoin.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,570
It’s an energy intensive process.

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,840
And thanks to China’s massive reliance on
coal, China has the energy to fuel it.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,640
Until this week, when Chinese authorities
ordered 90% of China’s Bitcoin mining operations

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,359
to shut down.

25
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,590
Local electric companies in Sichuan were ordered
“to immediately stop supplying power to

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,539
crypto mining projects.”

27
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,289
And “local authorities [were banned] from
approving new mining projects.”

28
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,260
But that’s not all.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,420
The Chinese regime isn’t just going after
Bitcoin miners.

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,860
They’re also going after people who use
it.

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,840
And they’re getting major Chinese banks
to help.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,159
I’ll explain more after the break.

33
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,340
Welcome back.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,390
And just a reminder, if you like China Uncensored,
we do accept Bitcoin.

35
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,880
Visit chinauncensored.tv/support to find out
how you can help us fight YouTube demonetization

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,470
with Bitcoin.

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,070
So 90% of China’s Bitcoin mining has been
shut down.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,060
There’s actually a big silver lining to
that, which I’ll get to in a moment.

39
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,610
But the Chinese Communist Party is also getting
major Chinese state-run banks and so-called

40
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,190
private Chinese companies involved in the
latest crackdown.

41
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,610
The People’s Bank of China summoned these
groups “and told them to ‘strictly implement’

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,590
recent notices and guidelines from authorities
on curbing risks tied to bitcoin and cryptocurrency.”

43
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,610
And in China, the main risk tied to Bitcoin
is using it.

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,020
Financial firms were told to identify customers
using or trading crypto.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,790
And cut off their ability to send or receive
money.

46
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,080
Five major Chinese banks wanted to show how
much they agree with the Party’s new crypto

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,420
directives.

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,670
So they took the initiative.

49
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,400
They said they’re going to “Prohibit the
use of their accounts for virtual currency

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,740
transactions.

51
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,430
They pledged to promptly put a stop to such
transactions, close bank accounts and report

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,680
signs of such activities to the authorities.”

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,290
“They also called on members of the public
to report virtual currency-related transactions

54
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,620
to the banks.”

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes, your neighbors can turn you in for using
bitcoin.

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,260
Modern problems require modern cultural revolutions.

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,610
And recently, Chinese police arrested over
a thousand people for alleged money laundering

58
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,130
with crypto.

59
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,280
Obviously if the Chinese Communist Party says
these people were committing crimes, it must

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,180
be true.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,050
And as I mentioned, so-called private Chinese
companies are joining the crackdown too.

62
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:09,120
Like China’s version of PayPal, AliPay . That
is of course owned by Jack Ma, one of China’s

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
richest men.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,700
Who disappeared for three months after criticizing
Chinese regulators.

65
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,729
Don’t worry, he wasn’t dead.

66
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:18,939
He reappeared.

67
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,099
After a major crackdown on his tech empire.

68
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,920
And now he’s just lying low, focusing on
hobbies.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,759
His hobbies include reading, painting, and
staying out of prison by doing whatever the

70
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,660
Communist Party wants.

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,280
Like cracking down on crypto.

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,439
Alipay said it will monitor and investigate
accounts for using crypto, and block or remove

73
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,820
those users.

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:51,110
That’s huge, since Alipay is used by more
than one billion people, and 80 million merchants.

75
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,960
Alipay also plans to use algorithms to detect
so-called abnormal transactions, flag them,

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,979
and restrict certain accounts from receiving
money.

77
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,699
I see no potential for abuse there.

78
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,349
Alipay also said merchants using cryptocurrencies
will be blacklisted and banished from the

79
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,129
platform.

80
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:15,949
Now this is hardly the Chinese Communist Party’s
first crackdown on crypto.

81
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:22,060
“Several years ago [China] imposed bans
on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges and digital-currency

82
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,199
fundraisings known as initial coin offerings.”

83
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,039
And according to Forbes, “The cryptocurrency
market has still not recovered from when China

84
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,360
announced its intensifying regulatory crackdown
on cryptocurrencies in mid-May.”

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,590
“The market’s total value, now around
$1.4 trillion, is around 56% of what it was

86
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,569
just over a month ago.”

87
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,639
In other words, it’s dropped by nearly half.

88
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,009
But as I said, there’s a silver lining to
all this.

89
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:57,979
As the Global Times says, as a result of this
ban, “Chinese miners must form alliances

90
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,779
to migrate overseas, to places such as North
America and Russia.”

91
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:08,590
In the long run, getting the majority of Bitcoin
mining out of China and out from under the

92
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,320
thumb of the Chinese Communist Party is good.

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,889
It means that the Party won’t ever be able
to manipulate Bitcoin transactions by controlling

94
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,840
more than half of the mining power.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,550
And that protects everyone who invests in
Bitcoin.

96
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,430
And this episode is sponsored by PC-Doctor
Toolbox.

97
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,930
Computer and software crashes, hardware failures,
and general computer slowdowns are way too

98
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,930
common.

99
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,999
And they can come up during the worst times—like
during a business meeting, or when you're

100
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,759
traveling away from home, and your trusted
IT person isn’t around.

101
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,819
If you're concerned about the health of your
computer and want tools to prevent untimely

102
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,589
system issues, you should be using PC-Doctor
