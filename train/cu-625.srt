00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,570
pollution solutions that will blow your mind,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,560
part 2!

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,620
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,540
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,170
China has declared war on pollution.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,770
The Chinese regime is pumping $277 billion
dollars

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,600
into coming up with solutions for the smog
problem.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Along with, you know,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,550
all the coal they’re pumping into the atmosphere.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,090
And there are some crazy ideas

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,010
about how to solve China’s smog problem.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,989
So many that I had to make a second list.

14
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,350
So if banning barbecues a

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,350
nd attaching sprinklers to the tops of skyscrapers

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,440
seemed like insane solutions,

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,320
wait till you see these next 10.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Number 10

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,730
Canned Air

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,450
Sometimes, life imitates art.

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,480
Spaceballs is art, right?

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,260
Well, as far out as that sounds,

23
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,100
one crazy Chinese millionaire actually did
it.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,420
The same guy who tried to buy the New York
Times.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,470
And lied to a room full of homeless people.

26
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,740
And sang karaoke to a room of journalists.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,220
Ugh, who’s going to solve that noise pollution?

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,780
Number 9

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,280
Ventilation Corridors

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,940
Beijing sure has some tall buildings that
can block airflow

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,530
and let smog linger.

32
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,310
And so somehow,

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,460
in an already-built city,

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,000
the Chinese regime plans to create ventilation
corridors

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,170
to blow the smog out.

36
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,820
There will be five large corridors,

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,250
each over 1600 feet wide.

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,930
Wondering how they’re going to do that?

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,930
Me too!

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,030
Fortunately, they’ve given no time frame
for the project.

41
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,110
I wonder how the smog and hot air will mix?

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
Number 8

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,740
Blame green technology

44
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,350
How dare you,

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,010
a foreigner,

46
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,770
criticize China for its pollution.

47
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,440
Because as the director of the

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,930
Anhui Provincial Environmental Protection
Authority, said

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,410
“China is a big exporter

50
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,590
and many foreigners have been benefiting

51
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,750
from China’s green products.

52
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,060
However, the pollution incurred during the
production process

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,159
are left in China.”

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,599
If China weren’t making so much green technology,

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,739
there would be no pollution!

56
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,019
Other than what comes from burning almost
as much coal

57
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,680
as the rest of the world combined.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,849
Gotta love the ideas Chinese officials come
up with.

59
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,599
Like Party official from Yunnan who suggested

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,849
China should punish this insult by foreign
countries

61
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,730
by using “dams to store water so that it
won’t all flow

62
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,780
to other countries and be wasted.”

63
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Number 7

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,519
Toss it into your neighbor’s yard

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,170
If burning tons of coal in Beijing

66
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,900
is causing all this smog,

67
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,730
the solution is simple—burn less coal...

68
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,730
in Beijing.

69
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,590
That’s where coal by wire comes in.

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,079
It means “turning coal into electricity

71
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,590
and transmitting it directly from the mine

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,730
where it is produced,

73
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,920
instead of transporting it to power stations

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,540
and then to consumption centers.”

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,860
In other words,

76
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,219
build your water-guzzling,

77
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,889
disgusting coal plants in faraway places like
Inner Mongolia

78
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,889
and Xinjiang

79
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,540
where people are poor and there’s hardly
any water.

80
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,010
And then send the energy over thousands of
miles to the major cities.

81
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,400
It’s worked so well, that

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,599
“there has been a 23 per cent improvement

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,549
in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area.”

84
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:31,549
And Xinjiang,

85
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,150
where the Uighur minorities live,

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,169
is now home to “six of the ten most polluted
cities in China.”

87
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,169
Number 6

88
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,719
Cloud Seeding

89
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,779
Simply wash away your pollution.

90
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,952
“It has become a tradition in Beijing

91
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,499
to seed the clouds before public holidays...

92
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,499
to make rain,

93
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:52,920
disperse pollution and ensure clear skies
on the day.”

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,329
It’s one of the tricks they used for the
Olympics!

95
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,879
Silver Iodide is shot into the sky,

96
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,109
and it helps creates ice crystals.

97
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,120
Those melt and the pollution comes down with
the rain.

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,870
Worried what liquified pollution might do
to you?

99
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,590
I’d worry more about the silver iodide.

100
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,980
It’s toxic.

101
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,139
Number 5

102
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,139
Give up

103
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,190
That’s right, give up.

104
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,519
The pollution is here to stay.

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,799
But, when trouble comes along,

106
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,210
why not take a cue from the wily ostrich.

107
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,040
Only instead of burying your head in the sand,

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,770
wrap it in a bubble!

109
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,640
Then the pollution can’t get to you.

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,319
China is considering biodomes.

111
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,190
What I like best about this idea

112
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,970
is it will be absurdly expensive.

113
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,560
So the rich will get to breath clean biodome
air,

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,849
while the rest of us can enjoy being out in
the pollution.

115
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:47,849
And yes,

116
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,570
this is how bad China’s pollution has gotten.

117
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,330
China’s elite are seriously considering
living in bubbles,

118
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,870
even at the risk of living out that terrible
Pauly Shore movie.

119
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,060
Number 4

120
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,310
Allow me to break the ice

121
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:11,310
What if you could treat pollution particles
like this?

122
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,210
Simply fill the skies with liquid nitrogen,

123
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,590
freeze the pollution,

124
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,950
and let gravity do the rest.

125
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,120
Because what could go wrong

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,330
with spraying industrial coolants into the
air?

127
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,340
And don’t worry,

128
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,449
creating a rain of pollutants is perfectly
safe.

129
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:27,449
Probably.

130
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,449
Maybe.

131
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,740
Ok, there’s nothing to back that up.

132
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,800
Number 3

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,280
Red Alert

134
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,550
When China issued two pollution red alerts
just a week apart

135
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,789
they knew something had to be done.

136
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,340
So they raised the threshold for red alerts.

137
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,690
And there hasn’t been one since.

138
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,259
Number 2

139
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,930
Floating Jellyfish

140
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,720
Check out this idea.

141
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,539
Oh, sorry, that’s the Matrix.

142
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,550
I should have known.

143
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,550
This is the idea

144
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,460
Giant, hydrogen filled jellyfish floating
in the skies.

145
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,880
Because floating sacs of hydrogen always work
so well.

146
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,280
In this actual plan submitted

147
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,250
as part of a competition,

148
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,730
pollution would be absorbed through the

149
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,520
head of the jellyfish,

150
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,259
sent down to the plant tubes,

151
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,650
and turned into drinkable water.

152
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,650
Huh,

153
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,240
I wonder if they ever thought of maybe...

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,530
not burning so much coal as a solution.

155
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,190
I’m just throwing that out there.

156
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,570
I’m no scientist.

157
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,970
But maybe that would make more sense

158
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,580
than giant floating jellyfish!

159
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,590
Maybe that’s number 1?

160
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,590
Number 1

161
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,970
Change the face of the planet

162
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Oh are you serious?!

163
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,659
I kid you not,

164
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:51,169
they have tried leveling mountains to clear
out pollution.

165
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,810
They got about halfway before they gave up.

166
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,910
And it made no difference in air quality.

167
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,960
That was in 1997.

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,130
And they’re still trying it.

169
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,350
But have they done anything to actually cut
back on coal?

170
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,000
Well...

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,250
they released statistics that show coal consumption
is dropping.

172
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,009
But can we trust that?

173
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,169
Well, last year, it was discovered that China
had been

174
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,270
“under-reporting its consumption for years,

175
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,250
after a different set of statistics were revised,

176
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,850
with the figure for 2012 alone going up 17%.”

177
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,360
Statistics with Chinese characteristics.

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,770
And according to the World Resources Institute,

179
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,099
in 2012,

180
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,610
the Chinese regime planned to make 363 new
coal fired plants,

181
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,919
which “amounts to an almost 75 percent increase

182
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,169
in coal-fired generating capacity.”

183
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,659
Yes,

184
