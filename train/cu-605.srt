00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,290
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,010
This June 4 is 29 years since the Tiananmen
Square Massacre.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,059
Or as they call it in China…

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:15,869
But while the Communist Party encourages collective
amnesia,

5
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,640
one tiananmen survivor has dedicated his life

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,520
to making sure people remember.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,070
I sat down with Fang Zheng

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,790
during the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,610
Thank you for joining me Fang Zheng.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
Hello.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,580
So why did you join the student protests in
1989?

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,980
It was very natural.

13
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,629
I was a senior in college at the time.

14
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,829
And like all of the young people at the time--

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,370
we were full of hope for our country.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,539
We loved our country.

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,239
We wanted to express our wishes so that the
country

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,449
could be even better.

19
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,649
So in 1989,

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,600
during the student protests,

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,829
We brought up issues,

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,729
such as eliminating government corruption
and profiteering,

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,640
and wanting greater freedoms.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,490
These appeals were our aspirations,

25
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,640
so of course I joined the protests.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,810
So you say you were there because you loved
your country.

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,490
But it became clear that maybe the Communist
Party

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,789
didn't feel the same way about the students.

29
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:27,579
Yes, this was a huge tragedy.

30
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,399
The Communist Party cared more about its power.

31
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,399
They separated the interests of the Communist
Party

32
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,380
from the interests of the people.

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,670
Even though the Party said that

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,329
they represent the people's interests,

35
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,750
at that time we truly experienced

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,479
how the Party put its own interests

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,369
above the people's interests.

38
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,509
When faced with the will of the people,

39
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,119
they chose to use military repression and
bloodshed.

40
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,630
It was a real tragedy.

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,990
I think that in a lot of people's minds,

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,509
the image that comes to mind

43
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,780
when they think of the Tiananmen Square Massacre
is Tank Man—

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,250
one man stopping a row of tanks.

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,929
I think what a lot of people in the West

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,510
don't know is that most of the tanks did not
stop.

47
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,330
Actually, these are two different scenes.

48
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,950
Yes, many people think of the Tank Man photo.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,640
But that happened on June 5.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
On June 5,

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,159
there was this courageous young man

52
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,019
who walked into Chang'an Avenue

53
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,110
and stopped a row of tanks.

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,760
The tanks did stop and that became a famous
photograph,

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,060
a symbol.

56
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,140
But many people don't know that

57
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,120
the Chinese Communist Party's massacre

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,519
really started before that, on the night of
June 3 to June 4.

59
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,330
My own misfortune is that on June 4 around
6 am,

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,319
I was also on Chang'an Avenue,

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
but this time when faced with a crowd of people,

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,700
the Chinese government's tanks did not stop.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,659
They charged us directly from behind

64
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,390
and killed many people on Chang'an Avenue,

65
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,439
creating a huge tragedy.

66
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,860
I was crushed by a tank and lost both of my
legs.

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,140
So I want to let everyone know

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,560
that during the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,120
in terms of the relationship between tanks
and people,

70
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,610
Tank Man represents one part.

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,860
But the tanks also really attacked and crushed
many people,

72
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,640
and I hope everyone can remember this.

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,590
You were there with students from your university.

74
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,349
What happened when you got word that the tanks
were coming?

75
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,909
At that time we were already retreating from
Tiananmen Square,

76
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,840
retreating back to our universities.

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,500
We had reached Chang'an Avenue (liu bu kou).

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,640
We didn't think that the tanks would rush
us from behind.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
At that point, the tanks had already taken
over Tiananmen Square.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,469
We were withdrawing from the square,

81
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:04,830
so we never thought that the tanks would attack
us from behind.

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,760
The tanks also threw smoke bombs,

83
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:16,190
which were exploding around us, causing chaos.

84
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,480
We couldn't see clearly.

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,510
To tell the truth,

86
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,230
we couldn't see the tanks until they were
quite close to us.

87
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,370
We didn't see the tanks coming and charging
towards us.

88
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,479
Because they came from behind, we didn't know.

89
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,130
What happened when the tanks caught up to
you?

90
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,370
It was very chaotic in that section of the
road.

91
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,449
At that point,

92
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,220
I was walking with a young woman from my university

93
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,250
and she fainted from the smoke.

94
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,810
I was trying to help her so I picked her up
and turned around.

95
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,039
Very quickly, just as I turned around, the
tanks drove up to us.

96
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,130
I didn't have any time to run or hide.

97
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,150
I could only push the young woman to a safe
spot,

98
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,389
but I myself was crushed by a tank.

99
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,729
Of the other people who were in that same
part of the road

100
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:12,970
at the same time,

101
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,009
we know that at least 11 people were crushed
to death,

102
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,720
and many others were injured like me.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:28,460
What was going through your head when you
got hit by the tank?

104
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,970
You can't say you were thinking about anything,

105
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,509
because you can't really think.

106
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,960
It was only three to five seconds

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,660
from when I first saw the tank to when I felt
it crushing me

108
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,930
and lost consciousness.

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,880
I wasn't thinking about much.

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,729
I felt a few things,

111
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,050
I felt the tank starting to roll over me,

112
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,259
it felt like I was being squeezed.

113
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,580
I also felt, right before losing consciousness,

114
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,590
I had some awareness,

115
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,720
the last thing I remember is seeing the white
of my bone

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,919
sticking out of my leg.

117
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,190
That was the last image before I lost consciousness.

118
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,189
It happened very quickly.

119
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,189


120
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,880
So, you were a prominent student athlete at
the time.

121
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,800
What did the Communist Party say happened
to you?

122
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,090
Of course, after the June 4th Tiananmen Square
Massacre,

123
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,960
the entire country was in a state of

124
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,250
total censorship and total control.

125
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,860
The political atmosphere was totally different.

126
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,810
For the students like me who had been injured,

127
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,340
they first thing they wanted was for us to
shut up.

128
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,169
They didn't want us to tell other people

129
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,889
the truth of what had happened to us.

130
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,500
They put a lot of pressure on me.

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,960
Of course they didn't admit that a tank crushed
me.

132
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,180
They didn't want me to say that fact,

133
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,479
they wanted me to change my story.

134
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,960
They even put a lot of pressure

135
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,050
on the young woman who I rescued,

136
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,780
until she was afraid to see me,

137
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,669
and she denied the fact that we were together

138
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,820
when the tanks came.

139
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,919
The Chinese government has all the power.

140
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,639
If you don't come to terms with them,

141
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,879
they'll stop you from going to college, from
graduating,

142
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,740
you can't get a job, you'll have no income,

143
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,150
or they'll put all sorts of pressure on your
family members.

144
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,340
So a lot of people will choose to lie,

145
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,110
or to comply with what the government wants.

146
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,280
A lot of people did this.

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,099
But I'm glad that I did not compromise.

148
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,550
I persisted in telling my real story,

149
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,580
my real experiences, to everyone.

150
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,949
That's why afterwards I suffered

151
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,120
a lot of injustice and persecution.

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,830
Not having freedom, being arrested,

153
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,599
having my house searched, not being able to
get a job, etc.

154
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,940
The price of telling the truth in China is
still quite high,

155
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,930
that is the current reality.

156
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,850
Why did you insist on telling the truth?

157
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,979
Because I felt that it was quite simple.

158
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,190
A person should not have to deny

159
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,360
the basic truth of his own experiences.

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,639
I think you first of all have to be responsible
to yourself.

161
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,819
I also persisted because the Chinese government

162
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,289
is afraid of us telling the truth

163
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,470
because they know the crimes they committed
on June 4th,

164
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,630
and they are afraid that everyone will know.

165
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,430
So even though it was hard,

166
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,480
I think persevering was worth it.

167
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,860
You must have felt a lot of despair during
all of this.

168
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:53,130
How did you carry on?

169
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,570
I did feel a lot of despair and regret.

170
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,940
But I was still surrounded by the love and
care

171
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,270
of my family and friends.

172
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,260
There are still many people out there

173
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,450
who care about justice and have a conscience.

174
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,520
The people around me gave me a lot of love
and encouragement.

175
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,590
My family and friends are one of the main
reasons

176
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,580
I could keep this up until today.

177
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,750
So even afterwards, you were a very accomplished
athlete.

178
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,200
But you weren't allowed to participate in
international events.

179
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,720
Why was that?

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,360
I think that one of the Chinese government's
biggest worries,

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,390
it was afraid that other people would find
out how I was really injured.

182
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,440
A lot of people actually already knew.

183
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,820
But for the Chinese government,

184
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,130
the more they could bury it, the better.

185
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,170
So they took away my right to compete in international
games

186
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,710
and stopped me from having the opportunity

187
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,010
to participate in athletic events for the
disabled.

188
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,880
For all these years, the main reason was to
cover up the truth,

189
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,310
bury the facts.

190
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,920
They don't want people to \hbring up June
4,

191
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,570
they don't want people to know about June
4.

192
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,070
Why is the Communist Party so afraid?

193
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,620
Of course everyone knows that a criminal

194
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,500
is afraid that their crimes will be exposed.

195
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,520
And they know they committed a huge crime.

196
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,010
Criminals don't want people to know about
their crimes back then.

197
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,880
That's quite natural.

198
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,220
In terms of both the international community
and in China,

199
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,760
for the past 29 years,

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,700
they have used propaganda and other methods
to cover up the truth,

201
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,680
and they have been successful to a certain
degree.

202
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,720
Many young people barely know anything about

203
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,810
what happened back then.

204
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,060
There's almost no way for them to get this
information.

205
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,210
And through these cover-up methods and propaganda,

206
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,510
the international community also pays

207
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,040
less and less attention to this issue,

208
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
so they've been able to get away with their
crimes until today.

209
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,110
So I feel like they've basically succeeded.

210
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,290
If so much of the world is forgetting what
happened,

211
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:23,550
why do you still speak out about the Tiananmen
Square Massacre?

212
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,350
There are two main reasons.

213
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,330
One is that this is something that happened
to me, personally.

214
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,430
Of course I don't want people to forget something
that I experienced.

215
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,140
But the more important reason is that after
June 4,

216
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,380
the Chinese government still continued its
repression and persecution.

217
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,030
The June 4 incident is not over, it's not
finished.

218
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,510
For examples, the victims of June 4 still
suffer persecution in China.

219
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,570
The Tiananmen mothers, whose children were
killed,

220
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,810
have still not received justice.

221
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,160
The June 4 issue has never been truly resolved.

222
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,580
The truth has not been revealed,

223
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,000
it's not clear to people.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,490
How many people died on June 4?

225
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,200
Who made the decision?

226
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,010
Why did the tanks come after us, to kill us?

227
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,070
All of these things--there is no truth.

228
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,320
Until the truth is uncovered, I must speak
out,

229
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,020
to remind everyone not to forget.

230
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:34,280
How were you able to leave China?

231
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,340
After 1989, I had no freedom for a long time,

232
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,230
so getting a passport was even more out of
the question.

233
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,260
During the 2008 Beijing Olympics,

234
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,860
I had a chance to get a Chinese passport

235
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,260
as a type of exchange with the government.

236
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,870
In 2008, the international community

237
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,490
had a lot of requirements towards China,

238
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,180
and China had made a lot of promises

239
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,420
to the international community,

240
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,380
like letting in journalists to do interviews.

241
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,680
At that time I had many interactions with
foreign journalists

242
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,430
who came to my hometown to interview me.

243
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,430
At that time,

244
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,040
Chinese government was most worried about

245
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,440
keeping me in my hometown.

246
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,210
As long as I didn't go to Beijing,

247
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,440
it was ok.

248
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Before this,

249
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,350
I had applied for a passport many times,

250
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,060
because I felt this was part of the normal
rights of a citizen,

251
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,100
but they refused me each time.

252
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:40,620
The Domestic Security Bureau told me they
couldn't give me a passport.

253
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,880
One day between the Olympics and the Paralympics,

254
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,650
a German reporter called me and wanted to
come interview me.

255
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,900
I knew him and so I said yes.

256
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,800
We arranged a time to meet.

257
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,760
He also wanted me to take him to interview
another disabled person.

258
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,870
But two hours before we were going to meet,

259
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,950
the police found out about it.

260
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,160
They were either tapping my phone or the reporter's
phone.

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,320
They came to my house and took me away for
a chat.

262
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,290
They told me that they knew a reporter was
coming to interview me.

263
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,790
They told me, we can let you speak to him,

264
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,410
but we can't let you take him to interview
other people.

265
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,530
We can give you two choices:

266
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,990
if you cooperate with us,

267
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,580
we can consider giving you a passport,

268
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,080
but if you want to go with him and take him
to interview others,

269
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,240
we can't give you a passport.

270
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
So I met with the reporter and told him the
police knew he was here.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,331
That they had already visited me

272
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:55,360
and they knew what we were going to do.

273
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,580
He was very nervous about how the police managed
to find him.

274
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,100
We were meeting in a hotel,

275
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,620
and there were many people who looked like
plainclothes police.

276
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,370
I told him the whole situation,

277
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,610
about how the police wouldn't let me go with
him

278
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,340
to interview another disabled person,

279
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,060
and if I went there would be consequences
for everyone,

280
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:24,420
but if I didn't go, they would give me a passport.

281
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,390
The reporter decided to give up on the other
interview.

282
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,840
He said, even if I just report the story of

283
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,770
what happened with you and the police,

284
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,480
that's still a pretty significant story.

285
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,600
So we didn't end up working together

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,900
and going to interview other people,

287
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,550
and he left to go to Sichuan to interview
others.

288
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,270
He then published the story of my encounter
with the police

289
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,160
when he returned to Germany.

290
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,730
The Public Security Bureau felt that I had
cooperated

291
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,010
with their request and didn't cause them more
trouble,

292
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:09,830
so they gave me a passport on August 28, 2008.

293
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,260
In 2009, with the help of the US government,

294
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,320
my family and I were able to come to America.

295
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,050
You've said that the most effective weapon

296
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,100
against the Chinese Communist Party

297
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,510
is not to forget what they want you to forget.

298
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,640
Why is that?

299
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,580
This has been one of the most difficult problems
in China,

300
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,990
under the Chinese Communist Party's rule,

301
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,510
this type of memory war.

302
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,730
The Chinese Communist Party has continuously
committed crimes

303
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,890
against the Chinese people during different
periods of history,

304
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,910
over and over again,

305
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,200
from when it first started to rule to the
present day,

306
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,560
almost 70 years now.

307
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,690
But why is it still successful?

308
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,060
The biggest reason is that through propaganda,

309
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,140
brainwashing, and thought control,

310
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,240
they've made people unaware of what happened
in the past.

311
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
They've separated each part of the past,

312
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,750
over and over again.

313
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,590
So young people will have no idea about the
crimes

314
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,880
the Party has committed in the past,

315
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,420
so they will still believe and have illusions
about the Party.

316
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
In this way,

317
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,150
the Party will be able to continue their rule

318
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,949
and their methods are working.

319
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,690
But if we expose their errors and their crimes

320
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,410
and let people know about the past continuously,

321
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,750
so that the memory is not broken off,

322
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,230
it will be harder for them to rule,

323
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,980
harder for them to continue their crimes.

324
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,780
It's a similar principle to how after World
War II,

325
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,970
the Nazis couldn't continue, they were destroyed,

326
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,850
because of how the Europeans and the Jewish
people

327
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,980
exposed the Nazis' crimes, publicized them,

328
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,540
and kept the memory alive so that people

329
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,960
could fully understand their crimes

330
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,640
and they could not continue.

331
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
But in China,

332
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,590
we haven't done this with the Chinese Communist
Party's crimes,

333
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,750
so they have been able to continue.

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,320
This is one way we can oppose them.

335
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,060
This is the resistance of memory.

336
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
When we were young,

337
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,690
because of our brainwashed education,

338
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,000
we did not know many of the things the Communist
Party

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,120
had done in China's past.

340
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,790
Today, many young people growing up in China

341
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,650
with information control and this brainwashed
education

342
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,870
also don't know what happened on June 4.

343
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,900
Each generation is separated.

344
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,630
History is isolated.

345
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,350
The truth is severed.

346
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,470
That means we haven't done enough.

347
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,180
So one of my biggest responsibilities now

348
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,640
is to tell more people about this so they
will know,

349
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,100
I especially hope that young people in China

350
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,150
will know about this.

351
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,330
You used to be a Communist Party member.

352
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,470
I'm wondering if you officially quit?

353
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,590
When I was in college,

354
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,060
I joined the Communist Party, in 1987.

355
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,990
At that time we had a certain amount of faith
in the Party.

356
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,860
Although we had just come out of,

357
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,160
and we were against the personality cult of
Mao Zedong,

358
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,490
we still had faith in the Communist Party.

359
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,700
Afterwards, we found out that

360
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,030
just opposing personality cults wasn't enough--

361
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,900
there was something fundamentally wrong with

362
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,970
the Communist Party as an organization.

363
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,530
We need to have a good system,

364
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,550
relying on a ruling party doesn't work.

365
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,110
But at the time we didn't realize this.

366
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,910
Now we've slowly realized that China

367
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,290
can't just depend on a ruling party,

368
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,190
we need a good system,

369
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,570
only then can we have a normal country and
avoid tragedies

370
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,340
like the June 4th incident.

371
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
After June 4,

372
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,440
the Communist Party wanted me to lie,

373
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,890
they wanted to me to use my Party spirit to
cover up the truth,

374
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,630
they said it was in the Party's interests.

375
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,900
I couldn't accept this because I felt the
Party's interests

376
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,680
were in conflict with the people's interests,

377
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,760
that the Party spirit was against the human
spirit.

378
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,350
I couldn't accept this,

379
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,070
so I naturally left this organization.

380
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,930
I know you don't have any hope for the Chinese
Communist Party,

381
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,900
but do you have hope for the future of China?

382
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,360
One must have hope.

383
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,770
I do have hope for the future of China.

384
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,060
But right now,

385
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,990
I don't have much confidence, to be honest.

386
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,970
There are many difficulties.

387
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,330
In the short term,

388
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,790
I can't see any definite reasons for hope,

389
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,680
but we must still keep going with a hopeful
attitude.

390
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,810
Because ultimately China will become a normal
country,

391
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,960
it will become like other countries,

392
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,700
there's no doubt about that.

393
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,040
It's just a matter of how long it will take.

394
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,300
Thank you so much for sharing your story with
us.

395
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,190
I can assure you that on China Uncensored,

396
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,680
we will never forget the Tiananmen Square
Massacre.

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,620
Thank you.
