1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,310
A huge protest in Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,220
Police refused to let them march.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,940
But do you think they listened?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,980
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,009
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,980
I’ve got some sad news for the Chinese Communist
Party:

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,550
The people of Hong Kong still don’t want
to be with you.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,750
It’s been 71 days since a million Hong Kongers

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,220
took to the streets in protest over an extradition
bill.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,400
That bill would have let the Hong Kong government

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,079
send people to China for trial,

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,190
which is something people were not thrilled
about.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,360
And two months later,

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,519
public anger is only growing stronger.

15
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,589
Yesterday, an estimated 1.7 million people
took to the streets.

16
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,859
Well, technically, they took to Victoria Park,

17
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,250
because the police refused to give people
a permit

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,329
to actually march on the streets this time.

19
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,749
But you can’t fit 1.7 million people in
Victoria Park.

20
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,269
So people ended up on the streets anyway.

21
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,780
Oh, and it was raining.

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,949
Heavily.

23
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,450
That did not stop them.

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,030
Fortunately, the umbrella has been

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,380
an important symbol of the protest movement.

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,640
Good thing their symbol isn’t white shirts.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,420
The Hong Kong government was not happy about
Sunday’s gathering.

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,310
As I said, police had refused to issue a permit
to march,

29
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,270
which forced people into the park.

30
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,310
But the park was too small,

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,660
so that forced people onto the streets.

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,180
So the government issued this press release,

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,490
criticizing the participants for occupying

34
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,540
“a number of thoroughfares on Hong Kong
Island,

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,490
seriously affecting traffic and causing

36
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,730
much inconvenience to the community.”

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,280
Hmm... “causing much inconvenience to the
community”?

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,070
1.7 million people—that is the community.

39
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,050
That’s almost a quarter of Hong Kong.

40
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,050
And you know what’s really

41
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,140
“causing much inconvenience to the community”?

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,750
Taking away people’s freedom and the rule
of law.

43
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,190
Or, what the government has been doing

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,040
over the past month or so:

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
labeling protesters as rioters,

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,159
so they can sentence them to up to 10 years
in prison.

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,780
Yeah, 10 years in prison—that’s inconvenient.

48
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,740
That’s why one of the protesters’ demands

49
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,040
is for the Hong Kong government

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,630
to retract the labeling of protests as “riots.”

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,710
They also demand the release of all protesters

52
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,770
who’ve been arrested,

53
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,710
the creation of an independent council

54
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,300
to investigate police brutality,

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,870
and universal suffrage for Hong Kong.

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,110
Oh, and they want that China extradition bill

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,980
to be fully and permanently withdrawn.

58
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,760
And really, if the Hong Kong government

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
had just withdrawn the extradition bill

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,110
after a million people marched on the streets,

61
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,220
this whole thing would have been resolved.

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,560
There would have been 1 day of protests

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,750
instead of more than 70.

64
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,570
There would be no need for tear gas,

65
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,120
no police brutality,

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,709
and none of that so-called “inconvenience
to the community.”

67
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,160
But really, this fundamentally comes down
to

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,300
the Chinese Communist Party itself.

69
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,380
Ultimately, the Party oversees Hong Kong.

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,020
And they won’t back down.

71
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Ever.

72
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,640
Because they think that military and economic
strength

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,450
can solve any problem.

74
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,620
And *that* is their biggest weakness.

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,450
And it sure doesn’t help with pro-Communist
Party people

76
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,730
interrupt pro-Hong Kong protests around the
world.

77
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,090
Like this one in Sydney.

78
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,910
“I love China!”

79
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,680
Or in Vancouver, where a Chinese guy driving
his Ferrari

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,319
yelled at the dumb hong Kongers for being
too poor.

81
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,520
Or this protest sign in London, where the
message is,

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,440
I guess, “*We* lick the CCP’s butt, so
why don’t *you*?”

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,120
I mean surely, if Chinese people around the
world act like this,

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,470
Hong Kongers will see how great the Communist
Party is,

85
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,989
and fall in line.

86
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,180
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

87
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,470
Before I go, I’ll answer a question from
one of you—

88
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,209
a fan who supports the show by contributing
a dollar or more.

89
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,310
Servando asks:

90
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,950
“What if Hong Kong became independent

91
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,099
to form a democratic people’s party

92
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,370
and ask the rest of China to join them!?

93
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,650
Communism will never work well for anyone.”

94
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,180
Good question, Servando.

95
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,410
The thing is, Hong Kong can no longer get
independence,

96
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,950
no matter what political parties they form.

97
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,280
Legally, they have no choice but to remain

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,770
part of the People’s Republic of China.

99
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,810
Why?

100
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,970
The reason dates back to an extremely sneaky
thing

101
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,130
the Chinese Communist Party did in the UN
in 1975...

102
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,190
to trap Hong Kong forever.

103
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,240
To learn more, I suggest you watch my episode

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,920
“Why Did the British Give Hong Kong to China?”

105
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Hint—

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,220
they didn’t have much of a choice.

107
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,630
Thanks for your question, Servando.

108
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,990
And thank you for watching!

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,190
And especially thanks to the several thousand
of you on Patreon

110
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,900
who support us with a dollar or more per episode.

111
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
With your contributions,

112
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,820
we could not keep making this show.

113
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,770
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

114
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,660
See you next time.
