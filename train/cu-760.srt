1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,240
China’s Xi Jinping has been named “core
leader.”

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,580
And with great power,

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,189
comes GREAT POWER!!!

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,340
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,820
You might think that if you’re already

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,900
the leader of the unfree world

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,010
and oversee the biggest country on Earth,

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,420
with the biggest military,

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,430
there’s not much room for job advancement.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,330
But you’d be wrong.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,330
Because last week,

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,140
the guy who already holds the titles

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,640
of General Secretary of the Communist Party,

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,340
Commander-in-Chief of the People’s Liberation
Army,

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,230
and President of the PRC

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,820
just got a promotion.

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Yes,

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,160
Xi Jinping is now China’s “core leader.”

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,560
Thanks Chris Buckley.

22
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,780
I love a good "core" pun.

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
By the way,

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,600
that's the most human looking photo of Xi
Jinping

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,180
I've ever seen.

26
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,290
He actually looks like he might be enjoying
that apple.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,280
Anyway,

28
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,370
back to the core issue here.

29
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,370
This is big.

30
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,740
I can’t stress that enough.

31
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,539
Core leader is a term first used by Deng Xiaoping

32
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,799
to describe himself, and Mao Zedong.

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,619
Xi has entered the pantheon

34
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,210
of the Communist Party's Olympus.

35
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,439
This comes after years of Xi Jinping

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
purging his political rivals—

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,240
members of a faction tied mainly to

38
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,990
former Chinese Leader and underworld amphibian,

39
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,250
Jiang Zemin.

40
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,539
When Xi first came to power in 2013,

41
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,630
one of the first things he said he wanted
to do

42
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,390
was eliminate labor camps.

43
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,359
He was blocked.

44
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,100
Labor camps were a huge source of money and
power

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,649
for Zhou Yongkang,

46
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,060
Jiang's protégé and one of Xi’s biggest
opponents.

47
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,130
But after months purging officials in the
oil industry

48
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,909
with ties to Zhou,

49
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,250
before the year was out,

50
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,760
Xi was able to close labor camps down and
begin

51
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,170
an investigation into Zhou

52
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,969
that would lead to his eventual downfall.

53
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,859
And even that only happened last year.

54
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,630
It’s been a slow grind,

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,799
but now that Xi is the core leader,

56
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,549
he’s basically filled his special bar.

57
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,769
Now, he can finally take down the biggest
tiger of them all—

58
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:06,809
Jiang Zemin.

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,060
You see,

60
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,920
Jiang Zemin had also been named a core leader

61
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,580
by Deng Xiaoping.

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,110
Sorry Hu Jintao,

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,530
always the bridesmaid,

64
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,310
never the bride.

65
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,690
But Jiang's situation was different than Mao or Deng.

66
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,400
Deng Xiaoping named Jiang a “core leader”

67
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,750
because of how unstable the Party had become

68
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,000
following the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,980
If it wasn’t clear that Deng fully supported
Jiang,

70
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,650
other political opportunists would have tried
to overthrow him.

71
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,570
And even still, there were attempts.

72
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,170
Xi, on the other hand,

73
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,680
took the title himself after slowly taking
out his opposition.

74
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,100
This was all carefully planned.

75
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,600
In fact,

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,090
references to Xi being called the core leader

77
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,680
by lower level officials

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,690
started appearing in state-run media

79
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,730
back in January.

80
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,060
And now that he’s a core leader,

81
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,470
he’s in a position to take out the previous
core leader.

82
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,860
But when people start putting your face on
souvenirs

83
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,550
next to Mao Zedong,

84
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,020
it means you’re both very powerful,

85
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,620
and at huge risk of being taken down.

86
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,040
You see,

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,800
in 1980,

88
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,620
a few years after Mao died,

89
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,080
the Communist Party created the

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,150
Rules on Intra-party Political Life.

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,920
It was set up to prevent the kind of personality cult

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,190
Mao created, that plunged China into

93
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,740
the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

94
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,620
The last guy accused of starting a personality
cult

95
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,540
was Bo Xilai.

96
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
Here he is

97
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,240
on a recent 8-part reality show of top officials

98
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,830
purged in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign.

99
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,390
Bo Xilai and his heavy-jowled mentor, Zhou
Yongkang

100
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,230
supposedly tried to stage a coup against Xi.

101
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,580
They obviously did not succeed.

102
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,650
Well now Xi has made it to core leader.

103
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,380
So, does he have the power he’s been trying
to amass

104
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,120
since the beginning?

105
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,460
Not quite.

106
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,290
The core leader announcement also stressed

107
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,740
“collective leadership”,

108
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,650
i.e. that collective leadership

109
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,430
“must always be followed

110
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,280
and should not be violated by any organization
or individual

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
under any circumstance

112
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,240
or for any reason.”

113
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,460
Collective leadership was also the system
in place

114
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,930
when Hu Jintao was Party head.

115
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,639
It meant that China’s top leaders—

116
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,590
the Politburo Standing Committee members—

117
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,789
had a lot individual say in how things were
run.

118
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,160
And since under Hu Jintao,

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,680
most of those guys were loyal to Jiang Zemin,

120
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,999
Hu couldn’t just do whatever he wanted.

121
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,999
Currently,

122
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,430
only three Standing Committee members

123
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,520
are still loyal to Jiang,

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,580
and they’re about to get force-retired

125
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,830
at next year’s National People’s Congress.

126
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
At that point,

127
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,539
Xi will get to hand pick the collective leadership.

128
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:43,539
In other words,

129
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,999
there’s still more power Xi can grab.

130
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,530
And if he gets it, then what?

131
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,300
Well, he may use it to stay in power

132
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,050
beyond the year 2022,

133
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,069
when, according to supposed precedent,

134
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,069
he would to step down

135
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,569
because he will have served two five-year
terms.

136
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,879
But since literally no Chinese Communist leader
in history,

137
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,289
except Hu Jintao,

138
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,719
has followed this precedent,

139
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,990
there’s really no precedent.

140
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,950
And Xi will probably do whatever he can

141
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,610
to stay in power.

142
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,509
So it ain’t over till the fat leader sings.

143
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,000
But all of this is basically following

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,080
what I predicted back in 2013:

145
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,990
Xi tries to play the role of the great reformer.

146
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,990
But he discovers,

147
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,120
oh the Communist Party is too corrupt to save—

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
in which case China would need a new system.

149
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,900
You know, not quite a president, or a dictator.

150
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,509
More of a presitator.

151
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,120
And with great power, comes...GREAT POWER!!!

152
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,430
So what do you think?

153
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,159
Is this the beginning of the end for the Communist Party?

154
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,159
And if so,

155
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,379
do you think Xi would hire me to head

156
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,940
the new English language Xinhua News?

157
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,000
Leave your comments below.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

159
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,350
See you next time.
