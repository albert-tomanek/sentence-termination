1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,230
Tesla’s China honeymoon is over.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,930
The US and China agree on climate cooperation

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,190
Plus, Australia cancels a suspicious deal
with China.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,790
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:22,240
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,310
This week’s China news headlines

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,670
Things aren’t going so well for Elon Musk
and Tesla in China.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,480
I tried to warn you, Elon.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,820
I tried.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,780
This week was the Shanghai Auto Show.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,340
A perfect opportunity to show off the new
Tesla.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,930
Except they got upstaged by protests.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,980
Protests, in China?

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,559
It’s a little sus, and I’ll get to that
in a minute.

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,609
This video from the protests went viral.

16
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:58,649
This woman climbed on top of a Tesla and started
saying some not very nice things.

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,929
Her t-shirt says “The Brakes Don’t Work”
and “Invisible Killer.”

18
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,390
Invisible Killer?

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,530
You mean Elon Musks has an invisible car?!

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,840
How does he not lose it?

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,430
The woman was later dragged off by security
guards.

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,780
But, “The incident overshadowed an announcement
[Tesla] made the same day...the automaker

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,799
would start developing some of its vehicles
in China from scratch—with new models that

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,430
would incorporate ‘many Chinese elements.’”

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,509
Ohh, many Chinese elements?

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,860
Like ethnic slave labor?

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,670
Anyway, the Tesla protest, “hit a nerve
in China, sending complaints about the company

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,820
ricocheting across the Chinese internet.”

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,630
That’s interesting, considering how tightly
the Chinese Communist Party controls the Internet.

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,390
Things don’t go viral for very long unless
the internet censors allow it.

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,310
Maybe it was the fact most of these social
media comments came to the conclusion they

32
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,229
should just buy Chinese cars instead of Teslas.

33
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,840
Interesting.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,830
This story was so big, even state-run media
covered it.

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,980
I know, Chinese state-run media covering a
protest in China.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,760
Interesting.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,280
Not only that, “The Central Political and
Legal Affairs Commission, a high-level Communist

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Party body...accused Tesla of arrogance and
of endangering Chinese consumers by selling

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,830
defective products.”

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,830
Interesting.

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,590
It’s almost as if the Communist Party itself
has taken issue with Tesla.

42
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,430
Tesla has now apologized for how the protester
was handled.

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,090
And it was totally inappropriate.

44
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,340
That’s not how you treat protesters in China.

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,390
You’re not supposed to let them criticize
you in public!

46
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,959
You're supposed to drag them outside and beat
them *before* they do any protesting.

47
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,489
It’s unclear to me what the quality of Tesla’s
China-made cars are.

48
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,909
In February, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla
for a rare public rebuke over its quality

49
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,099
record.

50
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,490
Then they banned military and state employees
from using Tesla.

51
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,830
The Chinese regime accused Tesla of gathering
data on Chinese drivers.

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,010
Which, of course they do.

53
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,940
That’s how Tesla’s automated driving system
works.

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,959
It collects user data.

55
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,451
But now the Chinese regime has arbitrarily
labeled it a national security risk, so they

56
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,659
can have leverage over Tesla.

57
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,709
Elon Musk may be a smart man, but when it
comes to China, he’s been making the same

58
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,470
stupid mistake Western businessmen have been
making for decades.

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,930
Elon Musk went into China with big dreams.

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,790
But Chinese competitors stole his technology,
with government support.

61
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,880
Now the Chinese government is using legal
warfare to squeeze Tesla out of the China

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,959
market, and promote home-grown companies.

63
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,790
This always happens!

64
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,709
Why are smart people so stupid?

65
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:12,239
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has some pretty
harsh words for...no country in particular

66
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,750
At the annual Boao Forum for Asia Xi criticized
efforts by some countries to “build barriers”

67
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,420
and “decouple.”

68
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,120
He said “The world wants justice, not hegemony.”

69
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah, Xi didn’t say which country in particular
was building barriers and decoupling.

70
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,720
But I’m going to go out on a limb here and
guess he was talking about...Palau.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,860
And you know who’s going to stand up for
the world against global hegemons like...Palau?

72
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,760
The Chinese Communist Party.

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,500
Don’t worry, world.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,190
Xi Jinping says that “China will never seek
hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence

75
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,760
no matter how strong it may grow.”

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Sure.

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,890
That’s like when I tell myself I’m not
going to eat Cheez-its while my hand is literally

78
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,430
in the Cheez-it box.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,020
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party is
gearing up for its 100th birthday.

80
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,870
And like most 100 year olds, it's decrepit
and falling apart.

81
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,890
But that’s not the message they’re going
with.

82
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,100
They want people to follow the Party forever.

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,470
The Party is pushing “Patriotic films.

84
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,950
History lessons.

85
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,280
Mass weddings.”

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,640
Just like Mao intended.

87
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,210
The anniversary is July 1.

88
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,870
And to get everyone in the spirit, the Party
is cracking down on anyone who makes illegal

89
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,930
comments on history.

90
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,650
And that might even include former top ranking
Communist Party members.

91
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:47,070
Like Former Premier Wen Jiabao . He wrote
a touching memorial to his recently deceased

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,070
mother.

93
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,900
It got censored.

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,920
Why?

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:59,070
Well, in the article he, in a rather roundabout
way, called for more fairness, justice, humanity,

96
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,500
and liberty in China.

97
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,630
Yeah, that’s not gonna fly.

98
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,120
Premier Wen Jiabao also wrote that his time
as the second highest ranking official in

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,300
the Communist Party was quote “like walking
on thin ice.”

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,060
Being a Communist Party member is tough.

101
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,140
Just look at what it did to the number one
guy at the time, Hu Jintao.

102
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,660
This is him as a young man.

103
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,510
And this is him as the head of the Party.

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,830
His nickname was woodface.

105
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,220
It’s been a great 100 years for the Party.

106
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,520
War, famine, cultural destruction, and lots
and lots of labor camps.

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,800
So much to celebrate.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,330
And the Biden administration is celebrating
by making a new agreement with China.

109
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,560
More after the break.

110
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Welcome back.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,690
The Biden Administration and the Chinese Communist
Party have made an agreement to cooperate

112
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,600
on climate issues.

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,500
The agreement came days before Joe Biden will
hold a virtual summit of world leaders to

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,720
discuss climate change.

115
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,060
Just what our planet needs—politicians spewing
hot air.

116
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,970
Of course, China is the world’s largest
emitter of greenhouse gases.

117
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,650
China burns more coal than the rest of the
world combined.

118
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,410
And that’s why the US has to work with China.

119
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,710
Climate change is a global issue.

120
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:28,660
And we can only solve it if we work together...with
regimes that break their promises.

121
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,720
Why does no one ever listen.

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,490
But at least China is doing one thing to combat
climate change.

123
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,880
After stealing US technology, China now makes
most of the world’s solar panels.

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,550
And they’re much cheaper now.

125
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,210
Because they use ethnic slave labor.

126
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,400
Fighting climate change, protecting human
rights—who says you can’t do neither.

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,430
This week, Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshide Suga.

128
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,660
It was his first in person meeting with a
world leader.

129
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,300
And the point was to project unity against
China’s assertiveness.

130
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,060
And to make sure America can get more of this...

131
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,370
And less of this...

132
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,900
We did a full episode covering the meeting
on our other channel, America Uncovered.

133
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,810
Check it out, the link is in the description
below.

134
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,550
Chinese hackers are compromising dozens of
government agencies, and defense contractors.

135
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,580
Hackers were able to exploit a VPN called
Pulse Secure that many US government agencies,

136
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,640
and just normal companies, were using so their
employees could work remotely.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,300
And good news, the hacking is still going
on.

138
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:47,180
But in some actual good news, Australia has
canceled a major Belt and Road deal with China.

139
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,200
Which of course angered China.

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,760
This is the state of Victoria.

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,010
It’s biggest city is Melbourne.

142
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,990
It’s the San Francisco of Australia.

143
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,520
You may remember it for having one of the
longest and harshest Covid lockdowns in the

144
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,000
world.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,030
Years ago, Victoria’s leadership made several
high profile deals with China as part of the

146
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,500
Belt and Road initiative.

147
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,740
That’s China’s global investment and infrastructure
plan that gets up to some pretty shady stuff.

148
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,630
But those deals have now been scrapped.

149
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,930
That’s under a new Australian law that gives
Australia’s federal government the power

150
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,830
to stop deals that Australia’s states have
made with foreign governments.

151
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,270
And get this.

152
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:36,330
“Two other deals between Victoria and the
governments of Iran and Syria have also been

153
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,800
scrapped.”

154
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,510
Making deals with China, Iran, and Syria?

155
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,550
What was the state of Victoria getting up
to?!

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,140
I say, not enough.

157
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,790
If Premier Daniel Andrews really wants to
bring his state a brighter future, it’s

158
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,170
time to buy nukes from Kim Jung-un.

159
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,340
Although Victoria seems a little eager to
make deals with authoritarian regimes, it’s

160
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,780
not alone in potentially having its deals
with China cancelled.

161
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,110
“The law may still allow the federal government
to review and overturn memorandums of understanding

162
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,510
between Beijing and the state governments
of Western Australia, South Australia and

163
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,720
Tasmania.”

164
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,680
That last deal was a real whirlwind.

165
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,820
Like I said, the Chinese regime is not happy.

166
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,500
Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of my favorite
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times,

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,970
tweeted:
“A formal agreement has been cancelled so

168
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,970
easily.

169
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:39,500
Australians, is your country a uncivilized
rogue that deserves stern admonition and punishment?”

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,790
Oh Hu.

171
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,370
Were you trying to insult Australia or compliment
it?

172
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,590
Because Australia’s entire brand is “uncivilized
rogue.”

173
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,100
It’s what makes them so charming.

174
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,970
And now time to answer a question from a member
of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army, fans

175
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,440
who support the show on Patreon.

176
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,690
brazzjazz asks “Mova Globes all seem to
depict Taiwan as part of China, I have checked

177
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,950
several globes on their website.

178
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,540
Why would you accept such a company as your
sponsor??”

179
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,040
Excellent question Brazzjazz!

180
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,530
We actually did a whole episode on it, called
How China Is Secretly Changing Everyone’s

181
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,530
Maps.

182
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,000
The link is in the Description.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,500
But here’s the gist.

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,070
MOVA Globes, like many Western companies,
had their products made in factories in China.

185
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,110
But then the Chinese government required that
all their maps sold in China, or printed in

186
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,570
China but sold abroad, had to have China’s
official version of the world map.

187
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:50,060
That meant some MOVA Globes were being printed
with China’s 9 Dash Line and Taiwan labeled

188
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,880
as part of China.

189
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,529
But the good news is that MOVA pulled its
manufacturing out of China a couple years

190
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,630
ago.

191
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,670
And MOVA was open and honest with us about
what happened, and helped us expose what the

192
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,140
CCP is doing.

193
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,790
They’re not printing China’s version of
the map anymore.

194
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,760
Like if you order this 6” Black and Silver
model, it no longer has it.

195
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,470
But some of the other sizes and models still
do—at least until their stock runs out.

196
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,450
So if you want to make sure the one you order
doesn’t have the Nine-Dash Line, contact

197
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,630
MOVA’s Customer Care.

198
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,870
Thanks for your question brazzjazz.

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,330
