1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,150
the Chinese regime wants to stop rich people

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,299
from moving their money out of China.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,579
I’m sure they’ll listen.

5
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:08,880
I mean after all,

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,000
they got rich in Communist China

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,100
by following all the rules.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,680
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,340
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,510
China is home to more than a million millionaires.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,029
Which is odd for a communist country.

12
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,560
I guess you’d call it “communism lite.”

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,539
Or maybe “socialism with benefits.”

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,120
Well, one of the most popular activities for
Chinese millionaires

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,760
is getting their money the Feng Shui out of
China.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,780
Money is flowing out of China

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,539
on the scale of several hundred billion dollars
a year.

18
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,570
And Chinese authorities are scared.

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,320
It could hurt their economy.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,530
Plus all the millionaires now have less money

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,970
left over to bribe them with.

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,970
So a few years ago,

23
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,879
the Chinese government passed a law:

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
A Chinese citizen is only allowed to transfer

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,859
the equivalent of $50,000 US dollars

26
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,680
out of China each year.

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
$50,000?!

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,900
That’s not even enough to buy a single

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,230
diamond-encrusted bathtub for your puppy!

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,400
So it should be no surprise

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,330
that China’s wealthy have come up with ingenious
ways

32
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,220
of getting large sums of money out China

33
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,990
without technically breaking the law—

34
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,610
or at least without getting caught.

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,310
A lot of millionaires launder money

36
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,190
through casinos in Macau.

37
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,180
But after that terrible typhoon flooded the
city

38
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,250
back in August,

39
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,580
a lot of them might be looking for new ways

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,060
to launder their money—

41
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,660
without getting it wet.

42
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,810
Which is why I’ve compiled this helpful
list

43
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,330
of 5 additional ways Chinese elite

44
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,480
can get their money out of China.

45
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,050
Number 5:

46
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,050
“Smurfing”

47
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,030
It’s named after the little blue cartoon
creatures

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,270
that demonstrate the value of teamwork.

49
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,800
Like when all the smurfs got together

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,210
to kill Gargamel and bury his body.

51
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,420
Or was that fan fiction?

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,110
Well, this kind of smurfing refers to

53
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,140
using teamwork to get money out of China.

54
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,960
If a rich person wants to transfer

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,820
more than $50,000,

56
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,520
he can “smurf” it—

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,170
by getting a group of family and friends together—

58
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,640
and they each individually transfer $50,000

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,900
into his overseas bank account.

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,280
Where did those family and friends

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,760
each get their $50,000?

62
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,390
How the smurf should I know?

63
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,030
Number 4:

64
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,890
Returning Merchandise

65
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,700
You can only transfer $50,000,

66
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,790
but you can still buy as much junk as you
want

67
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,030
when you travel overseas.

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,870
So let’s say a Chinese tourist visits Paris.

69
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,500
He can take his Chinese debit card and buy,

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,560
say, a $20,000 Rolex.

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,980
And then immediately return that Rolex

72
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,500
to the store for cash—

73
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,700
minus a small service fee.

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,490
He’s just gotten foreign currency,

75
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,170
without technically touching his $50,000 quota.

76
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,500
The only downside is,

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,870
now he has no idea what time it is.

78
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,870
The Chinese government eventually

79
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,750
caught onto this, though.

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,930
Now they’re monitoring

81
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,100
all overseas debit card transactions

82
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,560
of more than $150.

83
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,660
That should put a stop to it.

84
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,780
Unless...

85
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,450
instead of buying a single $20,000 Rolex,

86
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,750
he buys 500 individually wrapped

87
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,990
plastic Casio watches.

88
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,350
This could work, people.

89
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,819
Number 3:

90
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,500
Underground Banks

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,120
Carrying a briefcase full of Mao money

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,590
across the border may work in movies,

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,740
but like most things you see in the movies,

94
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,280
it’s a stupid idea in real life.

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,100
Like building a baseball diamond in a corn
field,

96
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,790
and hoping dead guys will show up.

97
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,790
But there’s a smarter way

98
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,480
to carry money across the Chinese border

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,290
that doesn’t require a suspicious briefcase:

100
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,440
A paper check.

101
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,470
Fortunately,

102
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,990
there are underground banks in China

103
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,740
that would be happy to provide this service
for you.

104
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,740
There’s lots of them.

105
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,970
They’re part of that shadow banking system

106
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,310
you hear about.

107
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,280
So you go to one of these shady,

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,300
underground banks and give them

109
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,980
your Chinese money.

110
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,500
They reach out to a shady bank in Hong Kong,

111
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,060
and then use that bank to write you a check

112
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,390
in foreign currency.

113
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,790
Now, all you have to do is take that check,

114
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,209
put it in your pocket,

115
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,989
and walk across the border to Hong Kong.

116
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,540
And then cash that check at a legitimate shady
bank.

117
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,980
Like Citibank.

118
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,040
Hong Kong is legally separate from the rest
of China,

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
so those pesky currency rules don’t apply
there.

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,570
Is this method of getting money out of China
legal?

121
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,090
Well, technically you weren’t the one

122
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,690
who transferred Chinese currency into foreign
currency,

123
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,220
so...sure.

124
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,750
Probably.

125
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,290
Maybe.

126
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
Number 2:

127
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,650
Hong Kong Money Changers

128
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,110
When I was in Hong Kong last year,

129
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,690
I saw tons of money change shops like this
one.

130
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,840
At first, I wondered,

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
how there could be so many of these,

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
just for exchanging currency for tourists?

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
Well, it turns out,

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,650
they have a more lucrative business model

135
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,169
on the side.

136
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,280
Fook Kee Seeds.

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Just kidding.

138
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,530
The side business is helping rich people

139
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,370
move money out China.

140
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,890
It works like this.

141
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,910
You—a Chinese millionaire—

142
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,160
travel across the border to Hong Kong

143
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,190
and set up a normal bank account

144
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,320
at, say, Citibank.

145
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,760
Set up the account in US dollars.

146
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,430
Then you go to a money change shop.

147
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,720
The money changer will give you a bank account
number

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,560
at their bank inside China.

149
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,280
Then you call your own bank inside China,

150
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,570
and have them wire transfer your money

151
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,410
over to the money changer’s bank account.

152
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,280
That money is still in yuan,

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,070
and it stays in China.

154
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,570
But a couple hours later,

155
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,970
after the wire transfer is confirmed,

156
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,970
the money changer will deposit an equivalent
amount

157
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,770
of US dollars into you Hong Kong account—

158
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,229
minus a small fee.

159
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,740
This may sound sketchy,

160
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,210
but it’s technically legal,

161
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,610
because no money ever crosses the border.

162
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,270
You’ve just got to trust them

163
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,350
that they’re going to give you your money

164
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,140
after that first transfer.

165
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,270
It’s like when a tourist visiting New York

166
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,699
asks a local to take a photo of her,

167
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,669
and hands him her expensive camera.

168
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:15,310
It’s all about trust.

169
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,780
And Number 1:

170
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,050
Expensive Art

171
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,380
For the truly en vogue Chinese elite,

172
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,720
the best way to legally move

173
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,690
large amounts of money out of China

174
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,690
is with expensive art.

175
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,750
Buy an expensive piece of art in China.

176
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
For example,

177
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,270
this ink splatter painting by modern artist
Hua Tunan.

178
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,780
What’s it worth?

179
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
10 dollars?

180
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Maybe.

181
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,830
But with the frame—

182
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,470
10 million.

183
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,449
So you, the en vogue millionaire,

184
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,050
take your Chinese money and buy

185
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,770
this expensive piece of art/crime scene photo.

186
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,720
Then you pack it up and take it with you

187
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,230
to the land of art aficionados—America—

188
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,230
where you sell your

189
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,280
painting/handkerchief from a coal miner

190
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,199
to an American collector for US dollars.

191
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,199
He can hang it on his wall

192
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,660
next to his velvet Elvis painting.

193
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Just make sure you sold him the original,

194
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,340
and not accidentally a placemat from Applebee’s.

195
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,370
And ta da—

196
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,669
you’ve just gotten cash in a foreign currency

197
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,070
without moving any money across the border.

198
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,770
And hey, don’t stop at paintings.

199
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,860
You could probably sell Americans

200
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,270
all sorts of objects at inflated prices:

201
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,730
statues, ceramics,

202
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,160
or the beard of a Daoist master

203
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,780
ground up with rhino horn powder and melamine.

204
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,180
So between these five methods,

205
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,669
plus a bunch of others that I haven’t even
mentioned—

206
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,199
China’s wealthy have no problem getting
their money

207
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,840
out of China on a large scale.

208
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,650
No one knows exactly how many millionaires

209
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,430
are transferring money like this—

210
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,479
since keeping it secret is kind of the point.

211
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,040
But next time you see a Chinese guy in a suit

212
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,070
walking down 5th Avenue in with an ugly painting

213
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,370
and 500 Casio watches,

214
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,030
you’ve found your man.

215
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,970
So if you were a Chinese millionaire,

216
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,710
which method would you use?

217
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,310
Leave your comments below.

218
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,720
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
See you next time.

220
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,039
Thanks for watching.

221
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,380
And if you *are* a Chinese millionaire,

222
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
the best way to make sure

223
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,020
you keep getting episodes like this

224
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,510
is to support China Uncensored.

225
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,800
With your money.

226
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,389
Money that I assume is about to be transferred

227
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,889
safely out of China.

228
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,160
You’re welcome.
