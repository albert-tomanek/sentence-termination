1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Protests in Hong Kong are heating up.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,900
And in response to chief executive Carrie Lam,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,380
a new group of angry citizens is getting involved.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,800
Here in Hong Kong

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,180
demonstrators and police have been clashing.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,720
After more than a million people took to the streets last Sunday,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,740
in protest over a proposed extradition bill.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,960
If passed,

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,940
it could allow the Hong Kong government to extradite people in Hong Kong

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,360
to mainland China.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,680
Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam is calling the protests "organized riots."

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,440
And China's foreign ministry is telling the US to stop creating chaos in Hong Kong.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,740
That's after the US already said it wasn't getting involved.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,180
But that's not stopping China Uncensored from getting involved.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,440
Walking into the protest, Shelley and I were ready for anything.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,780
Well maybe not that...

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,920
For what Carrie Lam called an organized riot,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,440
there sure were a lot of older women.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,340
Shelley, I thought you said there were going to be some serious mothers here.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah, I said there were going to be some serious mothers.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,700
Suddenly this protest made much more sense.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,600
But it still had an air of rebellion one might expect from... slightly younger older women.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,180
Do you think tonight's protests will turn violent?

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,980
No, I don't think so.

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,520
Do  you think the protests tonight will turn violent?

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,780
No, not at all.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
With a message of "don't shoot our kids,"

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,420
at least 6,000 people, mostly mothers, according to organizers,

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,280
staged a sit-in at a public park in the heart of Hong Kong's business district.

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,380
But Hong Kong police have shown in the past that they know how to handle rowdy older women.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,580
Woah.

32
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,740
But that hasn't stopped mothers this time from getting involved.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,140
Why did you attack those kids like this? It's enough for today.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,340
Just leave!

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
So why are you here tonight?

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,740
We're a group of mothers. We're all caring parents.

37
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,320
We want our children to have a

38
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,800
to have a home where they can breathe freely and voice their opinion freely.

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,400
Many of the youngsters were being hurt.

40
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,620
They had been arrested without reasonable reasons

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,280
They just fight for their freedom and voicing their opinions.

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,140
But you know what? Carrie Lam is a mother, too.

43
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,000
And that's why she says she's pushing the extradition bill.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Because it's for the people's own good.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
And you don't want to spoil your children, right?

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,900
And Carrie Lam certainly hasn't been spoiling these kids.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,700
But these mothers have something to say about that.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,340
When we heard from her speech like this,

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,860
we think as mothers, we all disagree with the way

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
of Carrie Lam.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,840
What she did, we all disagree.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,080
So we want to

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,920
to use our own way to express

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,820
our support to our kids in our own way.

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,960
We're actually very angry about that.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,600
No mother would use such violence toward their children.

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,700
Not to use bullets, and they had.

58
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,820
And all mothers should have the responsibility to provide a good

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,980
and respectable environment for their children to grow.w

60
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,380
And more importantly, she is not our mother.

61
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,740
She is paid by us. We are the taxpayers who want her to remember it very clearly.

62
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,340
So tonight, we are the mothers of the children who went to protest

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,580
and we ant her to listen to it.

64
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,880
So if the authorities think they can walk all over Hong Kong's freedoms,

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,340
they're gonna have to get past some serious mothers.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,460
But as the night wore on, their protests were getting clearly out of hand.

67
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,540
You can almost hear the kids screaming.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,760
Aw, cut it out, Mom! You're embarrassing me!
