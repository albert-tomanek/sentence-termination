00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:01,890
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,029
if you’re feeling dizzy, don’t worry!

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,509
It’s just the spin.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,520
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,880
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,960
At the beginning of the month,

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,450
The World Bank released its 2016

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,550
Poverty and Shared Prosperity report.

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,589
And Chinese state-run media ate it up.

10
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,589
Why?

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,619
Let’s just say,

12
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,759
it made China look pretty good.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,860
According to the World Bank report,

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,340
since 1990,

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,120
worldwide extreme poverty fell from 35%

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,260
to less than 11% today.

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,970
And most of that change is from China,

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,079
which has a fifth of the world’s people.

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,579
According to the report,

20
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,329
since 1978 China

21
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,250
“has lifted more than 800 million people
out of poverty.”

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,059
Even Westerners interviewed by Chinese state-run
media agree.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,610
“China has lifted 728 million people out
of poverty,

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,130
by international standards...

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,170
Therefore the contribution to human well-being

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,630
made Deng Xiaoping

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,320
is unequaled, in my opinion.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,040
I was really deeply moved.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,970
You may even hear my voice slightly waver.”

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, this British guy was so deeply moved

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,980
that he moved to China,

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,130
got a cushy job at Renmin University,

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,880
and now writes articles about how China’s
economic model

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,780
is so much better than what we have in the
West.

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,300
But I actually agree with him on one point:

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,430
It’s a good thing that so many Chinese people

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,510
are no longer living in poverty.

38
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,910
He just didn’t tell you the terrible catch.

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,289
Just because those 800 million people

40
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,469
aren’t living in poverty

41
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,130
doesn’t mean they’re doing great.

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,290
The World Bank defines poverty as

43
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,250
“the international poverty line of a dollar
ninety

44
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,330
per person per day.”

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,570
In other words,

46
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,619
if you make a dollar and ninety one cents

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:05,869
per day in China,

48
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,940
you’re counted as having been lifted out
of poverty.

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,780
You’re now called “low-income.”

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,250
And according to the Pew Research Center,

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,790
China still has about 900 million people

52
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,640
who are low-income—

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,970
people who make more than $1.90

54
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,000
but less than $10 a day.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,010
That’s a day,

56
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,010
not an hour.

57
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,480
A day.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,840
So while the version of China you see in the
media

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,370
looks like this,

60
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,470
with sparking Skylines and...

61
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,180
weird buildings...

62
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,819
..that’s just the part they want you to
see.

63
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,400
Most of China looks more like this.

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,599
So the great majority of people in China

65
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,569
are still really, really poor.

66
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,569
Just not in “poverty.”

67
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,870
Thus, the Communist Party can brag about

68
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,650
lifting people out of poverty,

69
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,620
and still be technically correct.

70
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,489
That’s the best kind of correct.

71
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,769
They’ve clearly been reading Derrell Huff.

72
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,270
And along with those 900 million really, really
poor people,

73
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,000
there is still a huge number of people living
in technical poverty.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
For example,

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,120
the 82 million who make less than a dollar
a day.

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,110
So the equivalent population of the entire
Western United States

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,390
is still living on less than a dollar a day
in China.

78
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,800
But the Communist Party chooses to focus on
the positive.

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,070
The people they’ve lifted out of poverty.

80
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,161
It’s just that...

81
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:32,959
the Communist Party maybe shouldn’t get
all the credit.

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,110
I mentioned that the World Bank said that
since 1978,

83
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,830
more than 800 million people in China

84
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,940
have been lifted out of poverty.

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,650
But what happened before then?

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,650
Well,

87
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,390
“for a long part of history,

88
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,409
China was the largest and most advanced economy

89
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,049
in the world.”

90
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,470
That’s according to the World Bank.

91
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,659
In 1820,

92
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,769
China had 33% of the world’s GDP.

93
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,950
In fact, during the 1600 through early 1800s,

94
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,780
the world so admired China that the Europeans

95
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,610
were making knockoff Chinese goods.

96
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,610
They called it chinoiserie.

97
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,549
Fast forward through two opium wars,

98
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,730
the Taiping Rebellion,

99
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,019
the collapse of the Qing Dynasty.

100
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,450
And just when the Nationalist government

101
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,010
was starting to rebuild the economy,

102
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,080
there was the communist insurgency,

103
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,440
followed by World War II.

104
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,910
At the end of World War II,

105
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,990
China was in shambles.

106
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,990
And the civil war

107
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,490
between the Communist Party and the Nationalist government

108
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,520
started up again almost immediately.

109
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
In 1949,

110
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,970
Mao Zedong took over the country.

111
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,000
And the first thing he did was...

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,930
kill one or two million landlords

113
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,790
and other wealthy people who may or may not
have been

114
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,650
a threat to his power.

115
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,480
And for the next 30 years,

116
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,150
the Communist Party completely,

117
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,140
and utterly wrecked what remained

118
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,670
of the Chinese economy,

119
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,180
with insane policies like

120
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,760
forcing farmers to make useless steel in their
backyards

121
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,150
instead of harvesting their crops.

122
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,000
Tens of millions of people starved to death.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,030
And most of the survivors lived in poverty
for decades.

124
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,520
Plus Mao's Cultural Revolution threw the country

125
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,710
into further chaos.

126
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,960
But then Mao died,

127
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,660
his yellowing corpse put on display for all
to admire.

128
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
And in 1978,

129
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,890
the new leader, Deng Xiaoping,

130
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,540
kind of figured it might be time

131
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,840
to let people make money again.

132
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,450
So he started lifting some of the

133
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,800
communist economic restrictions.

134
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,410
People began selling their extra crops,

135
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,410
starting businesses—

136
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,110
basically doing what they did before

137
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,710
the Communist Party suppressed them.

138
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,850
With hard work and ingenuity,

139
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,360
Chinese people began lifting themselves out
of poverty.

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,380
That’s right.

141
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,310
The Communist Party backed off,

142
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,500
and people started to make money.

143
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,730
But the flip side is that the Communist Party

144
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,980
also backed off from implementing

145
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,040
meaningful regulation.

146
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,850
So while a lot of poor farmers have been moving
to cities

147
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,370
for higher wages,

148
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,100
they are often forced to work long hours

149
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,670
in unsafe conditions for low wages

150
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,890
with no right to unionize.

151
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,890
But still,

152
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,520
the easing of communist restrictions

153
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,300
has been enough for 800 million industrious
Chinese people

154
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,710
to lift themselves out of abject poverty—

155
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,100
and into at least no-longer-starving-level
poverty.

156
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
And you know what?

157
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,480
That’s a great step.

158
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,170
I admire the hard work and tenaciousness

159
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,860
of people in China.

160
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
But even so,

161
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,430
China’s economy today is still not as big a share of the world's economy

162
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,500
as it was during the height of the so-called

163
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,040
“backwards” dynasties.

164
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,980
China now makes up 17% of the world’s total
GDP,

165
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,920
which is only half as much as it did 200 years
ago.

166
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,200
So don’t let the Communist Party take all
the credit.

167
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,590
To be clear,

168
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,510
I'm not saying that the Communist Party

169
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,930
wants Chinese people to be poor.

170
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,920
After all,

171
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,120
a huge gap between the rich and the poor

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,490
usually leads to social instability,

173
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,100
which would be bad for the ruling Party.

174
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
And my point here isn't to debate

175
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,560
which of China's specific market reforms

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
have been good or bad.

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,240
My point is,

178
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
looking at the big picture,

179
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,940
the Communist Party repeatedly takes all the credit

180
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,790
for "lifting people out of poverty,"

181
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,290
they're making themselves look great while

182
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,430
glossing over all of the things they did

183
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,050
to put people into poverty in the first place.

184
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,030
It's like a guy who congratulates himself

185
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,420
on the nice new house he built you--

186
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,740
after he set your old house on fire,

187
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,790
made you live in the rubble for decades,

188
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,330
and then allowed you to rebuild it yourself.

189
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,330
But hey,

190
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,780
he gave you a great deal on the bricks.

191
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,640
So what do you think about China’s

192
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,750
“lifting people out of poverty”?

193
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,370
Do you think that’s a fair measurement of
progress?
