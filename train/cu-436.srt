1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,049
"A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's
cool?"

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,529
"A billion people."

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,900
You know, we've all had our embarrassing moments
on Facebook, right?

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,960
Like that time I got stuck on top of a troll
in Norway.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,369
Or that Halloween I dressed like a future
robot version of Michael Jackson.

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,140
Wait. That was awesome.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,710
Even the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
has had his public foibles.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,130
Like this picture he posted last week.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,719
Oh ho ho, Mark, did you not notice how dangerously
full of smog the air was that day?

12
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,399
"It's actually 15 times the level considered

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,460
safe by the World Health Organization."

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,680
Huh, come to think of it, how did Mark Zuckerberg
even post the photo,

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,020
since Facebook looks like this in China?

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,560
I wonder if anyone else noticed that?

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,580
Oh.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,420
Well, like I said, we all have our embarrassing
moments on Facebook.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,480
Just not everyone gets it photoshopped into
the most iconic image of oppression from the

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,090
Tiananmen Square Massacre.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,020
Anyway, some people have taken offense to
Zuckerberg's photo.

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,970
But that was nothing.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,549
Because the next day, he met with the head
of China's propaganda department.

24
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,860
This all created fevered debate on the Chinese
interwebs,

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,009
especially on China's largest mirco blog,
Sina Weibo.

26
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,009
One popular account asked users,

27
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,729
"Will Facebook this time successfully enter
the Chinese market?"

28
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,100
Now, one would think even this comment wouldn't
get past Chinese censors, since Facebook has

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,860
been blocked in China since 2009.

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,820
But it wasn't long before the censors cracked
down...

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,970
on people picking on poor Mark Zuckerberg!

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,590
China Digital Times leaked this,

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,880
a top-down instruction telling press to control

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,990
"malicious commentary on Facebook founder
[Mark] Zuckerberg's visit to China."

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:03,370
Yes, the ones responsible for censoring Facebook
are defending the founder of Facebook.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
Even CCTV said...

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,140
wait, CCTV has 21 million Facebook fans?!

38
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,640
In fact, the state-run Global Times brags
that CCTV's Facebook presence is

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,540
“outshining many of its foreign counterparts.”

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,510
Now anyway, it's been no secret that Mark
Zuckerberg has gone pretty far in his attempts

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,500
to woo the Chinese Communist Party.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:36,080
I mean, it's understandable that he'd try
to impress crowds with his Mandarin.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,349
And you have to admit,

44
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,530
this family Lunar New Year greeting was kind
of adorable,

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,140
in an awkward way.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,050
But Zuckerberg goes that extra mile.

47
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,770
Like when he so coincidentally happened to
be photographed with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's book.

48
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,480
That was just there.

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,300
On his desk.

50
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,339
Prominently.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,980
Then there was the time, I kid you not,

52
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,300
he asked Xi Jinping to name his unborn daughter.

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,250
Xi Jinping declined.

54
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,099
So I think it's safe to say Mark Zuckerberg
will do whatever it takes to get China's 700

55
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,769
million internet users onto Facebook.

56
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,760
And can you blame him, really?

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,970
Yes. Yes you can!

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,129
And not just for his embarrassing sucking
up that is obvious to people on both sides

59
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,900
of the Great Firewall.

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,950
The Chinese regime ranks dead last in Internet
freedom, according to a survey last year by

61
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,470
Freedom House.

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,519
And yet this weekend, Zuckerberg praised the
progress China has made on the Internet.

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,409
"Zuckerberg said he appreciates China's achievement
in Internet development."

64
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,489
Seriously?

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,440
So you're saying you appreciate China's advanced
censorship technology?

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,989
That's like going to Agent Smith and saying,

67
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,799
"Oh yes, I really enjoy this Matrix you've
built up. Yes, mmm, very impressive. "

68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,159
"I...hate this place."

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
That's understandable.

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,209
Because seriously,

71
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,989
how would you feel if Facebook censored your
posts according to Chinese law?

72
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,620
My Facebook page would look like this.

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,090
And that's why I'm somewhat concerned when
my favorite state-run propaganda media says

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,440
Zuckerberg, "sets a good example for foreign countries
hoping to enter China's market."

75
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,560
Because if Zuckerberg is successful at getting
Facebook into China,

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
then he will be setting an example:

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,550
that an acceptable price for doing business
in China

78
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,550
is not just complying with the government's
censorship controls,

79
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,110
but running full tilt toward them with open
arms.

80
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,850
And if Zuckerberg thinks the controls are
going to loosen up,

81
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,250
he'd better think again.

82
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,650
Just this month, Chinese censors put into
effect new restrictions on foreign online publishers,

83
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,600
saying the purpose of content must be to "promote
core socialist values."

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,370
Which Zuckerberg should know all about from
reading Xi Jinping's book.

85
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,500
So for Facebook to ever be unblocked in China,

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,380
Zuckerberg will have to deal with what the
Global Times calls

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,460
a "lax filter system in dealing with harmful
information."

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,930
In other words, anything the Party doesn't
like.

89
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,009
And here's the thing,

90
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,710
I believe that Mark Zuckerberg genuinely cares
about China and Chinese culture.

91
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,310
It's just that by trying to get Facebook into
China,

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,120
he's helping the people who are making it
worse, keep it that way.

93
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,789
So what do you think about Facebook's attempt
to get into the Chinese market?

94
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,949
Would Zuckerberg be setting a bad precedent,

95
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,990
or is it worth censoring content to get Facebook
into China?

96
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,509
Leave your comments below.

97
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,900
And remember to check out the China Uncensored...

98
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,479
Facebook page ! While it lasts.

99
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,200
Once again I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.
