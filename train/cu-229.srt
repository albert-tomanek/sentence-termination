1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,780
China is fighting the coronavirus

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,100
With a brand new test

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,090
You might feel a slight pinch

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:19,810
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,240
China has a new coronavirus test.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,360
And it’s a real pain in the butt.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,270
Now I don’t want to taint your view of China’s
anal swab test.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,500
Some Chinese experts claim it’s way more
effective.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
One specialist told CCTV, “If we add anal
swab testing, it can raise our rate of identifying

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,010
infected patients.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,510
But of course considering that collecting
anal swabs is not as convenient as throat

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,260
swabs, at the moment only key groups such
as those in quarantine receive both.”

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,240
Sure, it’s not as convenient.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,350
But if you’re going to be forced into a
Chinese quarantine center you might as well

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,970
have a little fun, right?

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,630
So how does the test work?

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,440
Don’t worry, they’ve made diagrams!

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,159
You only have to put the swab in about 1-2
inches deep.

19
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,530
Of course, it’s also helpful to know what
the heck is happening.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,770
Apparently “some residents in China’s
northern regions...have been subjected to

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,830
the swabs with little warning.”

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,720
Surprise!\h

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,990
This new test couldn’t come soon enough.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,790
It’s almost Chinese New Year.

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,180
That’s the biggest travel holiday in China.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,000
An estimated 3 billion trips happen during
a normal year.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,380
That’s not good during a pandemic.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,730
Already more than 22 million people are under
lockdown.

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:57,010
And so “More than 1,000 schoolchildren and
teachers in Beijing were given anal, throat

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,150
and nose swabs last week.”

31
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,900
I hope not all at once.\h

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,200
On the plus side, I can’t wait for the next
New York Times article praising how well China

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,220
is handling the pandemic.

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,989
Those reporters can be the first ones to try
out the test in America.\h

35
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:23,510
Of course, one expert told Bloomberg, “I
don’t understand why Beijing added anal

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,510
swabs.”

37
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,310
Well, they don’t call it a Communist *Party*
for nothing.

38
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,459
While a couple of studies have shown that
in some cases the coronavirus is still detectable

39
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,049
in stool samples even after it doesn’t show
up anymore in nose or throat swabs, it’s

40
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,060
not clear that means anything when it comes
to spreading the virus.

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,139
“There’s no evidence that virus transmission
is any more common among patients who test

42
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,499
positive in the anus area.”

43
00:02:54,499 --> 00:03:00,069
All I know is, I do not envy the scientists
who have to run that study.\h

44
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,709
China doesn’t have any nationwide policy
about the anal swab.

45
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:13,230
So that leaves its use in the hands of overzealous
local officials—who will implement any policies

46
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,129
that might stamp out the coronavirus.

47
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,699
Or even policies that just make it look like
they’re stamping out the coronavirus.

48
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,129
No one wants to be in charge of the next Wuhan.

49
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,019
As the Washington Post puts it, “Since the
beginning of the pandemic, China has been

50
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,599
willing to take draconian measures to halt
the spread of the coronavirus, even at enormous

51
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,499
inconvenience to its population.

52
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:42,439
In the early days of lockdowns, health officials
sometimes sealed apartment buildings to keep

53
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,579
people from leaving.

54
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:50,919
Millions were rounded up for overnight flash-testing
drives, with people forming lines in the streets

55
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,980
in darkness.”

56
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,809
In darkness?

57
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:58,629
Why, that’s the perfect environment for
an anal swab!

58
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:04,639
And the problem is, now that anal swabs have
become a thing, unless someone in the central

59
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:11,370
government comes out and says to stop, more
and more areas will implement them, regardless

60
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,120
of whether they actually help.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,310
That’s how it works in China’s communist
system.

62
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,900
Another example of this is the problem that
China is having now with food imports.

63
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,410
In their eagerness to blame the coronavirus
on any other country that’s not China, Chinese

64
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,450
state-run media have been running a propaganda
campaign about how the virus may have come

65
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,930
from imported frozen foods.

66
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,830
Meanwhile the US Centers for Disease Control
and the World Health Organization have both

67
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,970
said that there’s no evidence that anyone
has gotten the coronavirus from frozen foods

68
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,330
or food packaging.

69
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,140
But people in China are now scared of buying
imported food, and frozen food is just sitting

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:01,400
at Chinese ports for weeks, causing a huge
backup in the global food supply chain.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,980
Some areas in China are also now dealing with
food shortages and skyrocketing food prices

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,530
due to lockdowns.

73
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,570
People aren’t happy about high food prices.

74
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,370
But they’re even less thrilled about the
anal swabs.

75
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,880
Obviously people are concerned about government
overreach.

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,300
Or would this be under reach?

77
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,580
But really, to help protect the public from
the coronavirus, is there anything you wouldn’t

78
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,950
let the government do to you?

79
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,680
Or are you a monster?

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,710
Anyway, no matter how bad things get in America,
let’s just say, they got it a lot worse

81
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,310
in China.

82
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,920
And this kind of penetrating, deep China coverage
would not be possible without the support

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,340
from viewers like you.

84
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,620
I call them the China Uncensored 50 cent army,
fans who contribute a dollar or more per episode

85
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,500
through the crowd funding website Patreon.com/chinauncensored.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,990
As a thank you, I’ll answer your questions.

87
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,680
Today’s question comes from TheOKWoodsman.

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,000
“With all the money and efforts into the
many military and ‘civilian’ island building

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,930
projects, isn't the CCP worried about sea
level rise due to climate change?”\h

90
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,060
Now that’s a good question.

91
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,880
If you don’t know, China is aggressively
expanding its territory in the South China

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Sea.

93
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,280
They’ve built artificial islands and then
call them Chinese territory.

94
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
How do they get away with that?

95
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,730
Well, first they militarize them.\h

96
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,390
And then they have Chinese citizens move in.

97
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,730
For example, Sansha City—built back in 2012
on the Paracel Islands.

98
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,180
It now has a population of almost 2,000 people.

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,650
But as you say OKWoodsman, what if the ocean
levels rise because of climate change?

100
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,400
Helped along by the insane number of coal
plants China has.

101
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,730
Well, that’s why China is also building
secret villages along the China India border.

102
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,800
Those are way up in the Himalayan Mountains.

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
So you see?

104
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,310
The Chinese Communist Party plans for any
contingency.

105
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,889
That’s why they hate to be the butt of jokes.

106
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,100
Thanks for your question OKWoodsman.\h

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,600
And thank you for watching.

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:49,909
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
