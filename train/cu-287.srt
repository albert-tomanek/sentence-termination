1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,349
Are you going to Scarborough Shoal?

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,969
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,020
Ready to catch some big fish?

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,360
What are you talking about, Chris?

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,100
Our fishing trip you told me about.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,840
You know “fishing trip” was a code word,
right,

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,630
for going to the Scarborough Shoal?

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,180
The Scarborough Shoal?

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,590
The disputed territory the Chinese Coast Guard
is patrolling?

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,880
Yeah, that Scarborough Shoal.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,960
Ok.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,690
It’s like two or three hours there and back,
right?

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,550
Ok, it’s 19 hours.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,990
19 hours round trip‽

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,950
Each way.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,640
Ok.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,160
Where’s our yacht?

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,020
So instead of the nice, relaxing fishing trip

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,569
I thought we’d be going on,

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:17,409
we’re going on a 120-mile journey

21
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,409
to the Scarborough Shoal

22
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,590
in the middle of the South China Sea.

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,560
That’s the center of a hotly contested territorial
dispute

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,390
between The Philippines and China.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,880
So, how do we get there?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,259
Why, we’re hitching a ride on a Filipino
fishing boat.

27
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,019
We’re going to be traveling in style.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,880
The Bubhoy fishing boat.

29
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,279
Joining the China Uncensored team are three
members

30
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,389
of the Philippine Daily Inquirer,

31
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,949
the biggest newspaper in the Philippines.

32
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:47,749
Little do they know

33
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:50,120
what they’re getting themselves into.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,480
Yar!

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,960
Shiver me timbers!

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,620
Row faster, ya lazy dog!

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Aye, Captain!

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,300
Are you guys going to do this the entire trip?

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,399
Argh, we be seamen,

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,080
you wouldn’t understand, you landlubber.

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,330
Landlubber!

42
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,459
We've done several episodes on the South China
Sea,

43
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,870
but being here,

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,379
knowing the Chinese coast guard could be

45
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,900
just over the horizon,

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,239
feels a little different.

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,489
I'm sure we’ll be fine, but just in case...

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,740
Hey guys!

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Where can I get a life vest?

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,260
Oh, I don’t think there are any left, Chris.

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,830
What?

52
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,160
Well, I guess the Filipino fishermen don’t
wear any

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,300
and they’re all right.

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,380
Oh, you didn’t tell him about the...

55
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,160
Oh, well, I mean, it was back in March, so...

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,660
Woah, wait, wait.

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,160
What happened?

58
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,120
I mean, this ship got rammed by the Chinese
Coast Guard.

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,160
This ship got rammed by the Chinese Coast
Guard‽

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,660
Yeah.

61
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,160
Yeah.

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,280
Oh.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,500
Uh, I think I’m gonna go talk to the captain.

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,260
Could you tell me more about the Chinese Coast
Guard

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,340
ramming this boat?

66
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,080
How they drove into it?

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
I’m afraid.

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,880
Because my son was driving this boat when
they hit this boat.

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,960
So what was the situation like back in March

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,340
with the fishermen?

71
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,220
Based on accounts of the fishermen,

72
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,400
we were being driven away by the Chinese Coast
Guard vessels

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,971
when they tried to get closer to the Shoal.

74
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,440
Some of the boats were rammed by the Chinese
Coast Guard vessels,

75
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,940
like this boat we’re on right now.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,580
And the Coast Guard—

77
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
the Chinese Coast Guard—

78
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,740
even used water cannons to drive away Filipino
fishermen.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,220
Which also happened to this boat, too?

80
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,220
Yes, exactly.

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,180
Not exactly reassuring.

82
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,729
But despite the dangers,

83
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:00,580
Filipino fishermen keep trying to come back.

84
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,170
Not only can they catch far more fish near
the

85
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,700
shallow waters of the Scarborough Shoal,

86
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,810
the lagoon inside is also a safe haven during
dangerous storms.

87
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,810
Except when the Chinese Coast Guard blocks
you.

88
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,900
For four years.

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,810
But a few weeks ago,

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,019
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte met with
Chinese leader

91
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,019
Xi Jinping.

92
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,900
Now there are reports the Chinese Coast Guard
are letting

93
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,669
some Filipino fishing boats at least go close
to the Shoal.

94
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,629
So we’re off to see just how close.

95
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,199
Well, it’s dawn in the South China Sea.

96
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,780
The fishermen are taking a moment

97
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,849
to see if they can catch some fish,

98
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,039
and then we’ll head off the Scarborough
Shoal,

99
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,449
where we’ll be holding a fan meet-up with
the Coast Guard.

100
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,610
The fishermen we spoke to have different opinions

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,639
about the Scarborough Shoal.

102
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,110
Some of them would be happy to be able

103
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,830
to fish there again.

104
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,380
Others are concerned that President Duterte

105
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,460
may have weakened the Philippines' claims

106
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,930
to the area.

107
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,240
But none of them want the Chinese Coast Guard

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,710
hanging around.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,020
So Matt,

110
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,940
it’s been about 19 hours now.

111
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,060
We should be seeing the Shoal pretty soon,
right?

112
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,780
I just talked to the captain.

113
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,589
It’s going to be 27 hours.

114
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,930
That’s—cool.

115
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,000
Captain's log:

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,340
It feels like we’ve been on this boat forever.

117
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,880
I think I may be coming down with something.

118
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,560
Shelley!

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Shelley!

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
Is this scurvy?

121
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,710
We’ve only been on this boat for like 24
hours.

122
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,490
But is it scurvy?

123
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,900
Captain's log: hour 24.5.

124
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,260
They’re all plotting against me.

125
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
Ben Affleck.

126
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,780
Ben Affleck?

127
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,520
The best Batman is LEGO Batman.

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,580
Captain's log: hour 24.6.

129
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,280
I am alone.

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,180
I have only one true friend.

131
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,900
It’s just you and me now, Milson!

132
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,080
Chris, Chris!

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,260
We’re almost at the Shoal.

134
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,760
Oh, great.

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
Let’s go.

136
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,240
11 miles out from the Shoal.

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,740
The captain tells us that usually here,

138
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,110
the Chinese Coast Guard would already be forcing
us back.

139
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,341
No sign of them yet.

140
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,460
Well, we are approaching the Scarborough Shoal,

141
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,040
which means we are within China’s Nine-Dash
Line.

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,540
That’s the boundary of what they claim is
Chinese territory.

143
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,280
And we’ve spotted around nine Chinese Coast
Guard vessels.

144
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,170
You can maybe make them out just over that
way.

145
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,720
So wish us luck;

146
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,830
we have no idea what’s going to happen.

147
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,170
It’s...a little more intimidating than I
imagined.

148
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,379
We are dwarfed by some of the larger Chinese
vessels,

149
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,310
including the two guarding the lagoon entrance.

150
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,909
Our captain is too nervous to approach them,

151
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,530
so we’re going around the side in small
boats

152
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,710
to avoid being intercepted.

153
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,090
Well, we finally made it to the Scarborough
Shoal.

154
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,270
It used to be that Filipino, Malaysian, and
Vietnamese fishermen

155
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,360
would all come and fish here at the same time.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,180
They would even meet together and eat on the
Shoal.

157
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
But in 2012,

158
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,099
China asserted its claim to the region

159
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,240
and all that stopped.

160
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,160
Well, as you can see,

161
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
it’s high tide at the Shoal,

162
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,980
so you can’t see much of it.

163
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,600
But as far as I’m concerned,

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,240
this territorial dispute is over.

165
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,740
Oh.

166
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,160
It’s solid rock.

167
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,800
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

168
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,280
It’s coral!

169
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,380
Oh.

170
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,400
Sailing to the Scarborough Shoal

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,900
has definitely made this territorial dispute

172
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,790
more real for me.

173
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,640
Especially how it affects the lives of these
ordinary fishermen

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,100
caught up in circumstances beyond their control.

175
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,600
For now,

176
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,450
the situation seems to be as calm

177
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,390
as the tranquil waters around the shoal.

178
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,560
But out here on the open ocean,

179
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
you never know what storms could be gathering

180
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,860
just beyond the horizon.

181
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,260
And so we beat on,

182
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,840
boats against the current,

183
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,540
borne back ceaselessly into the past.

184
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,340
Man, that was the coolest thing we’ve ever
done.

185
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,380
I can’t wait to get back to Manila and have
some lumpia.

186
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,110
You know it’s another 27 hours back, right?
