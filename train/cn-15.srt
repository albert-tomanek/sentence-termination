This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it's Chris Joel.

Did you just say gull?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Yes, that was the joke.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,840
-Okay, just... just clarifying that.
-Enunciate, then!

♪ I... didn’t come up with anything
to say here. ♪

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,080
In front of me I've got an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding.

13

And there's a special prize for
particularly good answers which is...

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,700
-That was pretty good.
-Yeah.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,360
And today we are talking about
the Norwegian butter crisis.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,600
Awrgh!

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,240
Of all the crises, up there with Cuban missile,
I always find.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,320
I can't believe that it's not a margarine crisis.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
Well, that actually clarifies what I was going
to ask which is...

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
-Clarifies!
-Clarifies!

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,440
I'd like to say it was on purpose - no.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,560
Just slid into that one.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
The Norwegian butter crisis.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,160
Was it a crisis involving butter?

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,480
In Norway.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,600
You can both technically have a point for that,
but I'd like a bit more.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,120
Is that a bit like an essay question where
you're just repeating the title

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
basically to get you out of deep water?

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,440
Now the question I have to try and think of the
answer of is,

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,200
did they have too much or too little?

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,320
-Because...
-"Aargh! There's so much butter!"

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
-I'm going for too much butter.
-Butterlanche!

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
-Butterlanche?
-Butterlanche.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,520
The question was too much or too little?

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,000
-Well, too much.
-Too little.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,560
Exactly the right amount,
which freaked everybody out.

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Gary gets the point.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
Too little butter.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,960
So if there's a butter crisis does that mean
there's a milk crisis going on as well?

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
-Oh!
-Ooh. Yes.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
Because doesn't butter come from milk?

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,320
Yes, it does.

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,920
Yay!
Do I get a point for that?

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,840
Yeah. You don't get a point
for butter coming from milk,

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,320
but you do get the point for…

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,960
But, yes, heavy rains during the summer affected
the grazing of cows and reduced milk production.

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,240
So what happens
if there is a shortage of butter?

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,160
You buy butter from somewhere else.

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Toast is awful,
it's just dry with a topping.

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,560
We're talking basic supply and demand here,
there is less butter therefore…

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,880
Butter is more costly and only available
to the crown heads of Europe.

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm... I'm giving you a point
for the first half of that answer.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,520
Norway was gripped by smørpanikk
which translates as...?

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
Some more panic.

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
Some more...

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
-Butter panic.
-Yes.

57
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,020
I can think of like a Norwegian panic scale

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,600
which is "nor-panic, smør-panik,
lots of panic".

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,120
So, yes, it got to the point where
a single pack of imported Lurpak butter…

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh, Lurpak, oh...

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
Cost, oh, you know what,
we get to do Price is Right rules here.

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
Here is a pack of butter.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
-A pack this big?
-Import...

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,520
-Here is a pack of butter.
-Here is a pack of butter.

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
Mid-December 2011,

66
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
-so this is recent.
-Salted or unsalted?

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
-It does not specify.
-Because it does depend on the use,

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,960
because if it's unsalted that's more your bakers
who are going to be throwing money at it.

69
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Oh, no, this is...
this is very much dietary butter.

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,680
-Dietary...
-Dietary butter?

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,200
Dietary butter, there's a butter diet now?

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
I quote.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Slice it like cheese and put it on toast.

74
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
-Place your bids?
-1,000 krone.

75
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,040
-1,000 krone.
-Oh, s***, we're doing it in krone?

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,080
No, we're not doing it in krone,
I don't have a calculator here.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm doing it in krone.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,240
1,000 krone is about 100 quid, I think.

79
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah, that's more or less 100 quid, so…

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
1,000 krone!

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm going to say the equivalent of 25 quid.

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
I was going to say 100 quid, but he's already
got that, so let's say £150 or 1,500 krone.

83
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Gary is correct,
£32 for a small pack of butter.

84
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,000
Hang on, 32 quid for a pack of butter?

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah. It's about the same as you pay
in Saino's now for Lurpak.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,600
So why did this not get resolved by...
by the free hand of capitalism?

87
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,680
Because the free hand of capitalism
had too much butter on it,

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,160
it was all slippy and couldn't grip it.

89
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,920
They could pass the butter but they couldn't
pick up the corners.

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Just sliding out of their hands.

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160
I think the butterfingers of capitalism

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
has just summed up everything
that's wrong with the world, Gary.

93
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm giving, yeah, you know what...

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Mystery Biscuits.

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Hey!

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,940
Actual satire.

97
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,640
Why did they not just import more butter?

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,520
-Tariffs.
-Yes.

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,380
'Cos… 'cos not in EU.

100
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,160
-Yes.
-Topical.

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
Hold on everybody, Radio 4, Radio 4, get the...

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
get the big reel to reel recorders running,
we're coming.

103
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,200
Yes, tariffs on butter, there was a deficit of
500 to 1,000 tons of butter in the country.

104
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,280
Just one shipping container.

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,180
That they can see over the border in...

106
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,080
...Sweden? Norway?

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,440
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
That is a land border.

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Yes.

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
(Thank you.)

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm all a bit hazy around that region,
I don't know who's next to what.

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
Surely that affected Sweden as well because the
weather should be similar around there, right?

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,080
You say that, what did some Swedes do?

114
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Did they taunt them on the border
by eating really thickly buttered toast?

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
-I'd do that.
-I would actually, yeah.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
To Lancashire!

117
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,840
Post butter over the border?

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
-Try and make...
-Smuggle, butter smugglers!

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes.

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
What's in the van?
"Nøt bütter."

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,960
A number of individuals were apprehended by
the authorities

122
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,860
for attempting to smuggle butter
across the border,

123
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,960
whilst Swedes posted online adverts
offering to drive butter to Norwegians.

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,640
Did they get around the customs
by greasing their palms?

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Hey!

126
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,600
No.

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,920
A Danish television show also broadcast something.

128
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Television.

129
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,360
I need to learn to be more specific
with my questions.

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,560
Did they just have some slow TV, Norway style,

131
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,080
but of just butter
melting in a kitchen somewhere?

132
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Someone's just watching going,
"What a waste."

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,760
Sad chefs with empty pans go looking
with big puppy dog eyes.

134
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
And going, "If only I had some butter."

135
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,040
Do you know what, yes, they broadcast
a satirical emergency appeal to send butter.

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,960
This isn't a joke,
there are people without butter in this country.

137
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
They gathered 4,000 packs to be distributed
to butter starved Norwegians.

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
-Bloody hell.
-Really.

139
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,880
There's a lot of very dark stuff in here,
but there is also the Ark of Taste.

140
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
What?

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,800
Is that like the Ark of the Covenant but with…
with tasty treats?

142
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,560
"Don't look at it!
It's full of...!"

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,320
The butter just comes flying out, fried foods.

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,240
"I'm melting!"
But it's butter, it's all just butter.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,560
Is it an institution kind of thing that is a...
a catalogue of national tastes?

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,200
So would it have the
fermented fishy canny thing in it?

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Almost, there's one word you're missing
in there,

148
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,480
which is, yes, it's a catalogue of international
foodstuffs and tastes and things like that.

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,600
Extinct.

150
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,760
Nearly.

151
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,800
You're not longer culturally dying out like
Welsh died out, that sort of thing...

152
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
That'll do, endangered heritage foods.

153
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,600
So is it all stuff that people either
can't be arsed to make any more,

154
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,160
they've decided it's not good for you
and it's gone out of fashion kind of stuff

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,400
and then everyone's forgotten about it?

156
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
Yeah, pretty much, it may not be
forgotten about, but it could be.

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,120
Or rules have presented it being done
like unpasteurised milk, that kind of thing.

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Does anyone want to name some of the things that
are in the United Kingdom section of the articles,

159
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,680
just in terms of categories, if not exact things,
what are we famous for historically?

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
Cornish pasties?

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
No, they're fine, aren't they?

162
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,440
There's loads of those,
there was one on York Station this morning.

163
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Just lying there abandoned,
sad music playing over the top of it.

164
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Some kind of cheese?

165
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,220
Yeah, it's mostly cheeses and grains, that’s…
that's the history of Britain right there.

166
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,560
What a great duo they were: cheese and grains.

167
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
-And potatoes.
-Potatoes, really?

168
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,160
-Potatoes.
-Any specific famous potatoes you might know?

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,760
King Edward?

170
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,920
Maris Piper?

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
You're just naming potatoes now.

172
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,040
That's what you asked us to do.

173
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
-What we're looking for here…
-What, an individually famous potato?

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
What we're looking for here
is the pointless answer.

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,120
The Koh-i-Noor potato that sat
in the royal crown up until 1640,

176
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,600
until the English Civil War the middle of the
English crown had a f***ing spud in it.

177
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,720
Jersey Royal, apparently...

178
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
How are they endangered?

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,760
It is listed here as being this…
this endangered thing.

180
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,200
I smell bulls***.

181
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,640
Not in there.

182
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,560
Not in there, not in there sadly,
there is old Gloucester beef.

183
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,320
Old Gloucester beef is just an argument
in old Gloucester.

184
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
Well, you enjoyed it.

185
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,440
Not to be confused with a double Gloucester beef
when there's only one piece of cheese left,

186
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,680
And you can't decide who wants it.

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
Come on Radio 4, come on, this is good.

188
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,080
We also have under food politics,
the British Restaurant.

189
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
That from World War…

190
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,720
I saw, sorry, I saw your face go there.

191
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,440
-Ding!
-That was the face of Gary going,

192
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
"I have remembered an archive fact."

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Can I just say, readers, there's a...
one of my things I'd like to get out on this…

194
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
-Did you just call them readers?
-Yes.

195
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
They may be reading.

196
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,880
They're that bored they've all got a book out.

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,640
Not every fact comes from intelligent things,
this is from Dad's Army.

198
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,840
The British Restaurant was a national
restaurant in the Second World War,

199
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,600
that sold cheap and…
cheap and good food to people.

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
-Yes,
-Not just soldiers.

201
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Absolutely right. It was a government...
it was originally a community feeding centre.

202
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,240
-then Winston Churchill came along and…
-Why did they change the name?

203
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,760
Yeah, Winston Churchill came along and decided
that British Restaurant was a better name.

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
"The British Restaurant."

205
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,280
"We're serving brandy
and you can have a large plate of brandy."

206
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,640
"And some cheese."

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,960
We also have the category here
in Wikipedia of butter.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
There is an entire article on Lurpak,

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,320
there is also an entire article
on someone called Norma Lyon - L-Y-O-N.

210
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,560
She's an American farmer and an artist.

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,800
Who painted in butter or carved into butter.

212
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
-Yes.
-Like the Lurpak advert,

213
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,640
remember it, this was in the 90s.

214
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes, born in Nashville, Tennessee,
what kind of things did she carve out of butter?

215
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
-President's faces.
-Busts.

216
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
Cubes. Bricks.

217
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
Cathedrals.

218
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,840
They're made of bricks,
just made of bricks.

219
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, this was a specific thing at the
Iowa state fair, and has been every year.

220
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,080
-Corn.
-It's... oh, it's very apt

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
that you would carve
this out of butter, it's almost…

222
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
-A cow.
-A cow.

223
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
Yes.

224
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,600
The Iowa state fair butter cow.

225
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
That’s taking the piss a little bit, isn't it?

226
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,160
Well, taking the milk, but you know.

227
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,040
If you're taking the piss, something's
gone very wrong with your butter, mate.

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,000
Do they carve a specific cow
or just the generic concept of cow?

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
Eh?

230
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,120
Oh, wow,
Plato's World of the Buttery Cave.

231
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
Eh, how does that work?

232
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Did they carve a cow
or did they carve Daisy?

233
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,960
Oh, right, so a specific cow or just like
an outline of, you know, cows. Yeah

234
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,680
So Daisy can look at butter Daisy
made from Daisy's butter.

235
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,720
No, it was a generic cow,

236
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,320
but there were also some other topical things
that were carved alongside it.

237
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
A milk urn or whatever it's called.

238
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,160
No, topical for whatever was going on
in the world that year.

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,200
A tank.

240
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,680
-Well, it would have been World War 2.
-What was the year?

241
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,960
Basically every... what I have for a list here
is everything since 1996.

242
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,960
Every year since 1996
they've carved something out of butter?

243
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,240
They've carved both a butter cow,
that's been since 1911

244
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,440
and since '96 there's been something else there.

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,680
-Tony Blair.
-Spice Girls.

246
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,560
We’ve both hit 1996 there.

247
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,240
You see, what was weird was what I didn't get
out in time was 'Mr Blobby',

248
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
so I would've been about '96.

249
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I think we were in Britain in 1996, weren't we?

250
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
No, some of the things include Tiger Woods,

251
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
when he... when he won the golf.

252
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
-Bill Clinton.
-A saxophone,

253
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,160
something that's definitely just a cigar?

254
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,760
-Yes.
-Ah. No, that... that year...

255
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
What year was that?
Good grief.

256
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,200
That would be about 99, no, 97,
it will have been around 96, 97.

257
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,520
No, an American eagle was there that year.

258
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
America.

259
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,000
And in 2007, Harry Potter.

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,040
-Of course.
-Wow!

261
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
-Harry Butter.
-Hairy butter?

262
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,080
-Hairy butter?
-Send it back to the cow.

263
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,680
Alright, there was one last thing I want
to talk about in the category of butter.

264
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,480
The great sentences of our time!

265
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,680
This is the butter episode,
and I would like us to talk…

266
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,400
The butter episode.

267
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,720
About artificial butter flavouring.

268
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Eurgh, just don't.

269
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,000
God, you sound like this chair
at an agricultural conference,

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
"There is... and finally, delegates,
there is one thing I would like to talk about,

271
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,280
"the scourge of artificial butter flavouring."

272
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,840
"Crusty butterers."

273
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,560
The thing is: it is a scourge.

274
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,480
It is a scourge?

275
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,160
A scourge is actually
a pretty good word for this.

276
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,040
Things that are calling themselves butter when
they aren't really butter,

277
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,360
but they've got pretend butter in them.

278
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,920
Yeah, it's butter flavouring
that goes into other stuff.

279
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
"'Tis but-ter flavouring!"

280
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,360
And that’s from the new BBC2 series,
"William Shakespeare, food analyst".

281
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Including a very modern bit of technology.

282
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
-VR.
-iPhones!

283
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,920
No, we're looking for something pretty modern,
technology that's…

284
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
that's used by a lot of people.

285
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,000
Condoms. Buttery condoms.

286
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,440
Oh, no.

287
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,560
-No.
-Hey, I've seen whiskey flavoured

288
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
and smoky bacon flavoured ones in pubs,
so that must be possible.

289
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,640
Those are the crisps, Gary.

290
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,600
The thing you're going to in the bathroom
to get your crisps from, they're not crisps.

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
Oh, that’s where the kid came from.

292
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,480
This is something that is causing
lung problems.

293
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,800
-Fags.
-Oh, vape!

294
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
-Yes.
-Buttery vape?

295
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,560
Buttery vape, popcorn flavoured vape

296
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,840
or butter and popcorn flavoured vape
was a thing for a while.

297
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
And now they are trying to sell it
without these chemicals in.

298
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
But that... that is vaporising some liquid,
so can you just put butter in it?

299
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,920
Use aerosol butter, yeah.

300
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,240
Or spreadable, that's more liquefied,
isn't it?

301
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,520
Yes, yeah, yeah, more oils though,
you've got to be careful.

302
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,880
I don't think inhaling actual butter is a...

303
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,680
is any better than inhaling diacetyl fumes.

304
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,960
Ah, but is it tastier?

305
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,680
There's only one way to find out, folks.

306
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
Smash cut.

307
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,640
And why didn't that flavouring, that margarine,
everything like that,

308
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,520
why didn't that solve the
Norwegian butter crisis?

309
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,200
Because it's dreadful.

310
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,040
Yes, that is actually the case.

311
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,160
Well, margarine, if you've ever seen it
in its natural form, is really unappetising,

312
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,720
just a grey lump, isn't it?

313
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,960
It is coloured yellow so it looks
more like butter, and therefore appetising.

314
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah, you're absolutely right, margarine was
such a poor substitute by Norwegian standards,

315
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,640
that they went out
and bought the butter instead.

316
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,680
I have lower standards than Norway.

317
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
And what year was this?

318
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,160
2011.

319
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,520
Oh, so that was still when you could get
reasonable butter substitute?

320
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, because...

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,840
It's still... it is still definitely a substitute?

322
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,020
It is still definitely a substitute
and that was why there was smør-panik,

323
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,800
butter panic in Norway.

324
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
And that's what the Smiths song,
'Panic' is about.

325
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Panic in the streets of Oslo?

326
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,360
Yeah, but Morrissey will be enjoying that
because he's a vegan,

327
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,180
he's known as a vegan, isn't he?

328
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,840
I think what we’re learning here is that
Morrissey caused the butter crisis.

329
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
"Morrissey!"
