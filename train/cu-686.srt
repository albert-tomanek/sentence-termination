1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,899
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,440
a beauty queen gets the axe.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,360
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,940
You know,

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,831
it sure seems like the Chinese Communist Party

7
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,260
is trying to get down, with the land down
under—

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,260
Australia.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,390
In fact, I was there a couple months ago

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,190
specifically to uncover how the Party

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,680
is attempting to infiltrate Australia—

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,050
through politics, business, and even community
groups.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,340
Which is why I really admire

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,500
shows like the ABC’s The World.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,720
Even though the ABC,

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,010
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,280
is a huge mega company that has some

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,190
pretty significant deals with the Chinese
Communist Party...

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,100
The World invited yours truly to go on air
this past March,

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,850
and talk about some of the things the Chinese
regime

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,010
wants to keep censored.

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,030
So I was very sad to hear that at the last
minute,

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,260
The World decided to cancel a live interview

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,360
they’d scheduled with Chinese rights activist,

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
former Miss World Canada,

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,640
and friend of the show Anastasia Lin.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,450
Anastasia is in Australia promoting

28
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,880
two of her new movies, Reunion,

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,700
which deals with forced organ harvesting

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,950
of political prisoners in China,

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,400
and In the Name of Confucius,

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,720
a documentary about how China’s

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,820
state-backed Confucius Institute

34
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,240
is undermining democracy in countries like...

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Australia.

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,729
And China Uncensored is sponsoring one of
her events.

37
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,409
So why did The World cancel the interview
with Anastasia,

38
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,830
after working on it for a week?

39
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,810
Apparently, a producer there

40
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,740
told Anastasia’s representative over the
phone

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,210
that she was being cut because higher ups
in the ABC

42
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,750
were concerned about Anastasia’s quote “affiliations.”

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,080
Whoa.

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,740
Pretty surprising,

45
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,979
since ABC has done more than most big media
companies

46
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,140
when it comes to covering the Chinese Communist
Party’s

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,020
infiltration into Australia.

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,070
But...maybe there’s a bit more infiltration

49
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,470
that needs to be exposed.

50
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,470
Now in response,

51
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,759
the ABC released this statement saying the
story,

52
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,090
“has no basis in fact,”

53
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,090
and “the producer...

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,319
does not recall ever using the word ‘affiliations.’”

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,319
In other words,

56
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,680
Anastasia is a lying liar and no one should
believe her.

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,490
Wow, funny, that’s what the Chinese Communist
Party

58
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,290
always says about her.

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,019
Go figure.

60
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:29,239
One little problem.

61
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,099
That phone conversation was recorded.

62
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,439
The Australian, another media company,

63
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,299
“can reveal that the conversation between
the producer

64
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,409
and Ms Lin’s representative was recorded

65
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,409
to protect her legal interests,

66
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,019
in case her version of events was disputed.”

67
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,769
Uh oh.

68
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,439
Now according to Australian law,

69
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,900
that recording can’t be released to the
public

70
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,620
unless the ABC gives permission.

71
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,329
And guess what?

72
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,370
They haven’t given permission.

73
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,939
Now for legal reasons,

74
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,069
I’m not supposed to say

75
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,199
whether I’ve personally listened to or not
listened to

76
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,040
any specific audio recording.

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,939
But I can say that a very credible source
has confirmed

78
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,049
that an ABC producer did indeed

79
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,709
tell Anastasia’s representative

80
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,959
that it was “a decision from….

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,959
higher-ups…

82
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,349
about some of Anastasia’s affiliations.”

83
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,949
Now the ABC didn’t clarify what “affiliations”
meant,

84
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,599
because this conversation—

85
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,909
which was recorded—

86
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,430
never happened.

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,870
But “affiliations” might refer to how
Anastasia Lin

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,499
practices Falun Gong—

89
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:40,310
a meditation practice persecuted in China.

90
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,400
She had won Miss World Canada in 2015,

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,989
but then was banned from competing

92
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,620
in the finals inside China.

93
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Not to worry.

94
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,480
The ABC has a section on their website

95
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,329
for lodging a complaint.

96
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,840
I’ve provided the link below in case you
have any.

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,049
And I’d just like to point out,

98
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,709
I don’t necessarily blame the show The World,

99
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,979
or its producers,

100
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,299
or its host for this.

101
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,180
We don’t know who those higher ups are,

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,549
if they’re higher ups in The World or the
ABC itself.

103
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,180
But after it came out that there was a recording,

104
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,539
ABC suddenly decided to release this article

105
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,449
about Anastasia’s work on organ harvesting.

106
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,419
What great timing!

107
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,880
Which just goes to show you:

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,790
It’s either totally a coincidence,

109
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,430
or all that international pressure

110
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,840
really does have an impact.

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,569
So what do you think about the ABC cutting
Anastasia

112
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,449
for her so-called affiliations?

113
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,300
Leave your comments below.

114
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,349
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored,

115
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,389
once again I’m Chris Chappell,

116
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,420
see you next time.

117
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,860
Thanks for watching.

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,569
It’s hard for a controversial show

119
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,520
like China Uncensored to get advertisers,

120
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,310
and a lot of our YouTube videos get demonetized.

121
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,300
And that’s why we rely mainly on your support.
