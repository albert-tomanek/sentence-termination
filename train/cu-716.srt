1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,440
Back to the G20.

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,140
As we draw the curtains on the meeting

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,990
between the world’s 20 largest economies,

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,309
and the streets are swept clean

7
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:12,240
from the several days of riots,

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
these 20 Gs head home.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,400
That picture just proves that Angela Merkel

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,920
is still the OG.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
But after it’s all over,

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,900
we’re left with the question—

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,360
what the heck just happened?!

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,780
The G20 had some big challenges:

15
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,340
Meaningful reforms on climate change,

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,119
a coordinated response to the Syrian crisis,

17
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,170
comprehensive solutions for refugees,

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,370
immigration, and terrorism.

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,360
But, when 20 world leaders with individual
agendas

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,730
all got in the same room, they...

21
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,640
let’s just say they made incremental progress
at best.

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,430
Outside the meetings, there were protests.

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,000
Some of them got a little crazy.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,160
And most threatening of all...

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,640
Clowns.

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,800
But worse than the protests were the media,

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,430
which treated us to non-stop G20

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,690
body language analysis.

29
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,480
Because who wouldn’t want to spend days

30
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,580
carefully scrutinizing these bodies

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,020
of old politicians in suits?

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,620
What’s that, Shelley?

33
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,000
There’s G20 fanfiction?!

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,160
Wait, no, don’t tell me.

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,840
Back to non-traumatizing physical contact

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,130
between world leaders,

37
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,690
there’s the all-important handshake.

38
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,540
Clearly, Trump won the handshake with Putin.

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,380
I mean, clearly,

40
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,500
Putin won the handshake with Trump.

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,520
Wait, that’s a still unclear.

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
But remember in January

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,940
when the world first learned of

44
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,520
the “Trump handshake?

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,540
That awkward handshake

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,120
where he pulls the guy towards him?

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Well, let’s just say China

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
has been learning from the West.

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,000
Speaking of China,

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,980
China.

51
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,180
China won big at the G20.

52
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,140
There was no conflict over the South China
Sea,

53
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,250
and no criticism of China’s human rights
abuses.

54
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,060
I think this clip illustrates the level of
tension.

55
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,140
“The wish was expressed that this time

56
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,100
I would bring with me two panda bears.

57
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,830
I gave a positive answer.”

58
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,890
So Xi Jinping brought pandas to Germany

59
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,470
that China will loan to the Berlin zoo

60
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,500
for a million dollars a year

61
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,750
for the next fifteen years,

62
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,480
and then China will demand the pandas

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,520
and all their offspring back.

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,880
Pandas, yayyy!

65
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,890
But anyway,

66
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,200
on to less black-and-white issues.

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,430
As I mentioned earlier,

68
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,530
during the G20,

69
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,930
the US and China did meet.

70
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,100
And it looked like everyone had so much fun.

71
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,070
They discussed two main issues.

72
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,070
One:

73
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,980
Trump wants to China to stop its unfair trade
practices

74
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
with the US.

75
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,730
We know that because Twitter.

76
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,730
And two:

77
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,820
Trump wants China to stop trading at all

78
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,790
with its nuclear-armed neighbor.

79
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,890
Oh sorry,

80
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,400
I meant the one with the dangerous leader.

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,940
The fat one.

82
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,070
Yeah.

83
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,760
Again, because Twitter.

84
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,819
But despite Trump’s increasing frustration

85
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,819
that Chinese leaders haven’t done more

86
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,630
to help with North Korea,

87
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,950
Trump remained cordial at the meeting,

88
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,290
telling Xi that he appreciated what he had
done

89
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,430
“relative the very substantial problem

90
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,380
that we all face in North Korea.”

91
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,180
So against all odds,

92
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,010
could their friendship live on?

93
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,750
I mean, in April they bonded over dessert.

94
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,880
“And we had the most beautiful piece

95
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,290
of chocolate cake you’ve ever seen.”

96
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,310
Most beautiful piece of cake?

97
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,680
I’d beg to differ.

98
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
But anyway,

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,130
what if the US-China cake-based friendship

100
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,580
starts to crumble?

101
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,370
Well, that’s why Trump may be

102
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,319
trying to improve ties with Russia.

103
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,660
Uh, no, I’m not talking about Trump Jr.

104
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,630
I mean President Trump is trying to improve

105
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,160
bilateral ties with President Putin.

106
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,220
This marks a departure from previous US policy.

107
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,470
Wait, “We can do stuff to you”?

108
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,060
Was Obama...flirting?

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,560
What’s that Shelley?

110
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,170
No, I haven’t been reading more fanfiction.

111
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,930
Who would write fanfiction about politicians
anyway?

112
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,590
Wait, no, don’t tell me.

113
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,750
What does this have to do with China, you
ask?

114
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,630
Well, over the past several years,

115
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,040
Russia and China have supported each other—

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,270
economically and politically.

117
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,510
Both hold permanent member seats

118
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,280
on the UN Security council.

119
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,239
They’ve used that platform to block

120
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,020
democratic nations from certain objectives.

121
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,070
For example,

122
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,210
putting sanctions on Syria.

123
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,210
And most recently,

124
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,020
efforts to target human traffickers.

125
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
If Trump is indeed planning

126
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,630
to put more pressure on China—

127
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,370
then a friendly, or at least neutral, Russia

128
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,020
could be to America’s advantage.

129
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,680
When President Richard Nixon visited China

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,100
in 1972 to establish ties,

131
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,810
his goal was to give the US leverage over
Russia—

132
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,590
then part of the Soviet Union.

133
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,800
It worked.

134
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,020
It would be somewhat ironic if President Donald
Trump’s

135
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,800
warming relationship with Russia

136
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,690
is now aimed at giving the US leverage over
China.

137
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,900
You know it could be working

138
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,610
when Chinese state-run media say,

139
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,610
“Fine.

140
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,610
I don’t care.”

141
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,870
Of course, that doesn’t guarantee that Russia

142
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,180
wouldn’t try to be buddy-buddy

143
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,020
with both China and the US.

144
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
After all,

145
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,680
the Chinese regime is doing its best

146
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,340
to promote a positive image of Putin

147
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,410
on social media.

148
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,410


149
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,410
But take it from me,

150
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,410
it never works when you try

151
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,410
to have two best friends.

152
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,410
To be clear,

153
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,410
I’m not saying that the US

154
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,710
should definitely cozy up to Russia.

155
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,710
For one,

156
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,810
Russia is an authoritarian state

157
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,490
that has done a lot questionable things.

158
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,500
Not that that’s stopped the US

159
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,530
from working with other authoritarian countries.

160
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,530
And two,

161
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,520
the Trump Administration’s growing Russia
problems

162
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
might make it difficult for them

163
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,960
to have a strong relationship.

164
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,449
But the Trump administration may still try.

165
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,919
Because you know what they say,

166
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,560
the frenemy of my frenemy

167
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,620
is my...fren-en-enemy?

168
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
So we’ll be keeping an eye

169
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,400
on how the world’s superpowers are shifting

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,510
the balance after the G20.

171
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,420
At least in the fanfiction.

172
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,210
Speaking of frenenenemies,

173
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,580
China and Vietnam.

174
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,080
We’ll have more after the break.

175
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,280
Wait for it...

176
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,180
It happened! Oh my gosh, it actually happened!

177
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,380
Even they look surprised!

178
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,040
As for Canada's Justin Trudeau, well...

179
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,680
sometimes it's best not to read too much into body language.

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,440
There's probably fanfiction about this, isn't there?

181
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,760
