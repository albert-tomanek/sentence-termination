1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,670
A new virus is spreading in China.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,910
Are Chinese authorities covering it up?

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,600
And do you need to be worried?

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,960
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,370

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,800
Because you should be using a reliable VPN
whenever you go online.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,520
There’s a new virus spreading in China.

9
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,130
It appears to cause pneumonia, and in some
cases, death.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,840
The new virus is a coronavirus.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,920
It’s in the same virus family as the common
cold,

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,940
and as SARS,

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,430
the deadly virus Chinese authorities covered
up back in 2003.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,670
It’s called a coronavirus because it’s
like ads for Corona beer:

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,879
They cover up how terrible it will make you
feel.

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,980
The first confirmed case of the new coronavirus
appeared on December 31

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,110
in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,200
Never heard of Wuhan?

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,350
It’s just another small central Chinese
city...

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,040
of 11 million people.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,949
“Many of the cases were connected to the
Hua-nan Seafood Market,

22
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,110
which also sold live poultry and exotic animal
meats.”

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,380
Exotic animal meats apparently includes...

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,180
Live ostrich, live civet cat, alligator tongue,

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,110
and good old-fashioned dog meat.

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,930
What could go wrong?

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,880
So how widespread is the new virus?

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,070
It’s complicated.

29
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,410
First, let’s go to our trusted source:

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,150
Chinese state-run media.

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,150
On Wednesday,

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,720
they reported that the number of confirmed
cases was 543 in China.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,380
I expect those numbers to go up by the time
you’re watching this.

34
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,420
There have also been several cases abroad,

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,420
including one in the US.

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,600
But fear not!

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,740
According to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
the Global Times,

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,649
the virus is preventable and controllable.

40
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,110
Just like democracy in China.

41
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,270
Chinese state-run media released

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,970
this footage of doctors in protective gear.

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,110
It’s all very sanitary.

44
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,070
There’s even a doctor claiming patients
have been cured.

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,350
“Up until January 17 there have been 19
patients

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,350
who have been cured of this (virus) and left
the hospital.

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,590
This pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus,

48
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,729
in general, can be cured.”

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,760
So again, you have nothing to worry about.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,209
Which is why authorities in Wuhan have imposed

51
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,220
a semi-quarantine on people traveling in and
out of the city.

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,150
And at least 17 people have officially died
of the coronavirus so far.

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,960
That would make it less deadly for now than
SARS.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,129
But you might want to worry about the official
numbers.

55
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,550
The “543 cases in China” statistic comes
from

56
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,410
the same state-run media and government agencies

57
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,470
that covered up SARS in the early 2000s.

58
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,420
Meanwhile, in London,

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,599
the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease
Analysis

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,040
estimates that there are more than 1,700 cases.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,540
And that’s just in the city of Wuhan.

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,100
One expert told the BBC that

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,530
“For Wuhan to have exported cases to other
countries

64
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,300
would imply there would have to be

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,800
many more cases than have been reported.”

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Don’t worry,

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,760
he added that it’s “too early to be alarmist.”

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,480
I’ll let you know when it’s time to be
alarmist.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,870
That’ll probably be next week.

70
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,370
That’s because Chinese New Year begins this
Saturday, January 25.

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,760
It’s the peak of China’s annual travel
season—

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,060
and the world’s largest human migration,

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,430
where Chinese people will take an estimated
3 billion trips.

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,140
That will include an estimated 7 million overseas
trips.

75
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,380
This is potentially a huge problem.

76
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,209
Especially now that Chinese authorities have
confirmed that

77
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,630
human-to-human transmission is happening.

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,220
It’s not just for people who visit exotic
animal markets anymore.

79
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,480
So the big question here is,

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,290
have Chinese officials been covering up the
spread of the coronavirus?

81
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,290
Yes.

82
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,730
The answer is yes.

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,940
On January 16, a little over two weeks after
the first reported case in Wuhan,

84
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,340
there were still only 41 confirmed cases of
the virus in China.

85
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,959
And they were only in Wuhan, nowhere else
in China.

86
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,300
That was according to Chinese authorities.

87
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,300
But there were already three confirmed cases
in Thailand and Japan.

88
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,849
Again, that’s part of the reason these scientists
estimated

89
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,349
the number of cases was much higher than reported.

90
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,910
Meanwhile, as official Chinese state-run media
was being censored,

91
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,850
rumors about the virus started on Chinese
social media,

92
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,130
and went, uh, viral.

93
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,150
This WeChat text thread claims that

94
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,500
"All the information about the infection is
being locked down."

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,580
This one claims that hospitals won’t even
give you the test

96
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,760
that would identify the virus.

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
And this one says,

98
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,990
"I asked a doctor, it's true.

99
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,890
Four people were deceased just in his ward,

100
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,220
numerous medical staff were infected."

101
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,110
Now again, these are just rumors.

102
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,270
But people spread rumors like this when

103
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,330
they don’t trust the authorities or the
media.

104
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,630
And then rumors like this can cause panic.

105
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,810
Then on Monday,

106
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,040
Chinese state-run media reported that Chinese
leader Xi Jinping

107
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
said China will “resolutely curb” the
outbreak of the virus.

108
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
On the same day,

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,560
the official number of confirmed cases of
the coronavirus

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,979
suddenly tripled.

111
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,169
And the virus also suddenly spread from Wuhan

112
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:11,180
to several Chinese provinces.

113
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,350
And the official number has kept increasing.

114
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,050
Not to mention, only after Xi’s announcement
did Chinese officials

115
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,110
also confirm that there was human-to-human
transmission.

116
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,890
Funny how that happened.

117
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,220
Almost as if Xi Jinping had given permission

118
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,670
to stop the coverup that totally never happened
in the first place.

119
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,550
And this exposes a fundamental weakness

120
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,479
of the Communist Party’s rule in China.

121
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,660
In a system so obsessed with top-down control
and scapegoating,

122
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,160
lower-level officials are incentivized to
cover up things

123
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,970
that could be politically bad for them.

124
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,030
Things like the start of a possible pandemic
in your city

125
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,850
from a sketchy market that sells dogs and
ostriches.

126
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,340
How do they cover it up?

127
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,289
The Guardian reported on one case where

128
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,759
the relatives of a woman who died of pneumonia

129
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,760
were told by doctors that she probably had
the coronavirus.

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,400
But she hadn’t been screened for the virus
before she died,

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,580
and the hospital pressured the family to cremate
her quickly.

132
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,340
So she didn’t officially count as one of
the almost 300 confirmed cases.

133
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,440
If you don’t officially count the patients,

134
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
they don’t have the virus, right?

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,390
Similar cases have been posted on Chinese
social media,

136
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,290
and then those posts got censored.

137
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,740
But now that Xi Jinping has said that China

138
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,199
must “resolutely curb” the outbreak,

139
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,080
that could mean that the cover-up will stop.

140
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,590
After all, Chinese authorities said on Tuesday

141
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,660
that “lower-ranking officials who covered
up the spread of the virus

142
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,560
would “be nailed on the pillar of shame
for eternity.”

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,530
Ouch.

144
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,740
On the other hand, this might mean the cover
up will get worse.

145
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,169
Because now all those officials have to cover
up the fact that

146
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,910
they had previously covered up the spread
of the virus.

147
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,710
I mean, no one wants to be nailed on the pillar
of shame for eternity.

148
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,080
And again, people in China

149
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,960
think that the government and media are lying
to them,

150
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,740
which causes more anger and panic.

151
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,169
What do you think about the Wuhan coronavirus
cover up?

When you go online, everything you do is being
tracked and logged—

155
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,319
by the websites you visit and your internet

156
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,240
And in many cases, by the government.

157
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,490
And if you’re in an authoritarian country
like China,

158
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,310
this kind of tracking can put you at risk
of surveillance and even arrest.
