1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,990
I’m here with Andrew Choi,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,319
the executive producer of the movie, “Ten
Years,”

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,809
which won Best Film in the Hong Kong Film
Awards.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,840
Andrew, thanks for joining us.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,969
I’m a huge fan of this film,

6
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,420
I’ve seen it at least five times.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,420
Tell me,

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,380
what’s it like working with Channing Tatum
and Chris Pratt?

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,930
What’s that, Shelley?

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh, that’s a different movie also called
“Ten Years…”

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,080
Andrew, excuse me for just

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
a moment.

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,670
Okay, Andrew, thank you.

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,560
Pardon the interruption.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,420
So I just watched “Ten Years,”

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,560
which is apparently a collection of five short
films

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,310
about the Chinese Communist Party’s erosion
of freedom

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,520
in Hong Kong.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,780
So the film is set in 2025,

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,479
ten years in the future of Hong Kong.

21
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,249
Why are there no robots or sentient machines?

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,039
Well, because we have a very limited budget.

23
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:29,049
That’s the best answer!

24
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,859
Actually, we talked to the director and said,

25
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:39,049
we only have 100,000 dollars Hong Kong per
film.

26
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:40,359
So it’s very, very low budget.

27
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,430
Per each of the five films?

28
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,430
- Yeah

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,259
So total, 500,000 Hong Kong dollars budget.

30
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,460
So I don’t think you can have a robot with
this budget.

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,960
Always cardboard.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
So why did you get involved with this film?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,060
Well, I think we started out 3 years ago,
it was 2013,

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,979
me and my co-producer, Ng Ka-Leung,

35
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,969
who’s a wonderful director,

36
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,300
we just finished a documentary film in Hong
Kong

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,400
also talking about some of the changes in
Hong Kong.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,520
And we had the idea that,

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,360
oh, after this documentary film want to do
a feature film

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,200
about the future of Hong Kong?

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,691
Because back then you could kind of sense
that

42
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,630
Hong Kong is changing.

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,260
Of course the influence of China is,

44
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,480
you can feel it’s getting

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,640
more and more involved in the Hong Kong issues.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,450
So we were just asking the question,

47
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,690
what’s next for Hong Kong?

48
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,160
So “Ten Years” was very successful in
Hong Kong -

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,200
sold out theaters.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,380
Were you expecting this kind of response?

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,390
Definitely no.

52
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,780
We never imagined we could have such a

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,440
huge response.

54
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
At the beginning we were imagining,

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,620
maybe one theater can show it for one week.

56
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,410
At the end, theaters showed it for eight weeks,

57
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,250
total of six cinemas show it.

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,280
But even after eight weeks,

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,470
our film was still doing quite well.

60
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,690
It was selling out in all cinemas.

61
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,320
But the cinema told us,

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,970
sorry Andrew, but we won’t have any screening

63
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,490
time for you next week.

64
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,490
And we were asking why.

65
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,500
“It was making money for you guys.”

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,290
He just says, “I’m sorry,”

67
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,740
I just don’t have any slot for you guys.

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,280
So that’s an interesting part,

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
since that normally won’t happen in Hong
Kong.

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,990
Why do you think there was that?

71
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,540
Well, of course they won’t tell us the reason.

72
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,320
But you can kind of know it’s self-censorship

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,480
from the cinemas.

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,470
But yeah, we don’t have the chance

75
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,970
to continue to show it in the cinema.

76
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,910
We show it in the community.

77
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,440
So we did 150 screenings since February this
year

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,090
in universities, community centers,

79
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,180
different high schools or even churches.

80
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,740
So yeah, people are eager to watch our film.

81
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,250
So we continued to screen it for 5 or 6 months

82
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,210
in the community.

83
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,550
And then it won Best Film at the Hong Kong
Film Awards.

84
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,560
How did you feel about that?

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,900
So we were very surprised,

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,549
and of course we were honored.

87
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,159
But I think this film,

88
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,870
not just because that we,

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,460
in terms of production quality, I don’t
think we are in that level.

90
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,789
In terms of the meaning,

91
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,770
in terms of response from the Hong Kong people…

92
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,219
But I think people appreciate it for the timing
of the film,

93
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:36,840
that it was released.

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,090
And people say, well, it seems like things
we’re talking about i the film

95
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,560
are actually happening in Hong Kong.

96
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,689
So people say you are prophesying the future,

97
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:47,819
and it’s really happening.

98
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,569
And so it generated more awareness to the
Hong Kong people.

99
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,080
And I know some people said the things that
happen in the movie

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,030
could never actually happen in Hong Kong.

101
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,580
But then as you say, shortly after it came
out there was the

102
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,680
five Hong Kong booksellers that were detained
in mainland China,

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
in the past few months there’s the interpretations

104
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,560
Beijing is making about Hong Kong legislators.

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,850
So do you feel that opinion has changed

106
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,639
that this could never happen?

107
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,900
Well, actually, people are saying that we
should

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,759
change the title of the film.

109
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,479
Instead of “Ten Years,” we should name
it “This Year.”

110
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,099
Because we are imagining the future ten years
from now, right?

111
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,099
2025.

112
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,860
But just a few months after we release the
film,

113
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,409
people are saying things are already happening
in Hong Kong.

114
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,590
You can really sense these things are going
to happen

115
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,870
in the near future.

116
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,050
Actually, when you do the film

117
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,389
all the directors have this in mind that,

118
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,620
we don’t want to see the story

119
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,270
that we talk about in the movie happen in
real life.

120
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,430
But unfortunately, things are already happening,

121
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,949
as you said.

122
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,669
Some of the conspiracy theories that we talk
about

123
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,789
in the first film,

124
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:04,960
people can associate…

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,659
Actually, the Mong Kok Incident in February
this year -

126
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,659
there’s a riot.

127
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:12,900
Fishball Revolution.

128
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
People kind associate,

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,360
“oh, this is what you’re talking about
in the film.”

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,650
And of course the bookstore,

131
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,910
in the film we talk about a secret bookstore.

132
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,969
So people associate those things we’re talking
about

133
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,880
with things that are already happening.

134
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,499
And when we do the local community screenings,

135
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,139
especially after the Q&A session,

136
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,259
we always say that, in real life,

137
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:44,139
things are more ridiculous than what we’re
talking in the film.

138
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,169
And because of the political nature of the
film,

139
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,990
have you face any censorship or pressure because
of it?

140
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,689
Not directly.

141
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,439
We are asked very often,

142
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,219
“are you guys being followed?”

143
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,740
“Are you guys afraid?”

144
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
No.

145
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,349
So far, no.

146
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:07,470
But I think - I think we can feel the pressure,

147
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,719
especially when we know,

148
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,900
when we were nominated in the Hong Kong Film
Award,,

149
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,599
The main news, Global Times, wrote an article
about us,

150
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,189
that we are spreading virus.

151
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,639
Spreading despair.

152
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,940
I believe the specific term they used for
the film was a

153
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,280
“Thought virus.”

154
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,300
- Yes, thought virus!

155
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Congratulations!

156
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,319
Actually, yes!

157
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
After this news came out,

158
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,589
we were just saying we got free publicity.

159
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,370
In Hong Kong, when the government say something,

160
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,370
you’re no good,

161
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,439
it means that’s very good.

162
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,919
So it helped people to do more of our film.

163
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,900
We really believe that our film

164
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,189
is doing something right.

165
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,080
It’s definitely, actually, a good way to
understand

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,110
things that are happening in Hong Kong.

167
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,819
Any plans to take the film to the mainland?

168
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,150
Well, there’s a pirated version.

169
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,699
Yup, I heard it is quite popular among the
mainland people.

170
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,900
There’s a lot of download - a lot of BT,
I heard.

171
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,039
Of course it’s illegal.

172
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,559
But that’s probably the only way we can
go in.

173
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:17,719
I don’t think you’ll be making that box
office revenue.

174
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,499
No, there’s no box office there.

175
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,259
But we released in Taiwan, the film.

176
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,839
And we went to, I think,

177
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,809
over 30 international film festivals in the
past year.

178
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,440
I think we did arouse quite a few interests

179
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,240
in different areas in the world.

180
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,919
And we just released a DVD.

181
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,940
And we released it online.

182
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,220
So hopefully more people will see the film.

183
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,600
For the China Uncensored viewers in the US,

184
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,500
is there any way they can see the film?

185
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,550
I think we’re gonna release it in iTunes
and Google Play

186
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,990
in the US as well.

187
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,660
So you guys have a chance.

188
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,990
But I can share a little bit about our next
project

189
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,560
because it’s related with “Ten Years.”

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,269
Because we went to a lot of international
film festivals,

191
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,430
we got the idea of “Ten Years,”

192
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,100
it’s a very local topic about Hong Kong.

193
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,990
But when we show it in other countries,

194
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,630
people are very interested.

195
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,660
Not only to Hong Kong,

196
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,160
but they kind of reflect off of their own
country.

197
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,730
So we’re going to have a project called
“Ten Years: International.”

198
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,430
We’re going to go to different places to
do a local version of “Ten Years.”

199
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,990
For example, we’re going to Taiwan.

200
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,019
We’re gonna do a “Ten Years: Taiwan.”

201
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,389
We’re gonna have local Taiwan directors

202
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,600
to do a “Ten Years” about Taiwan.

203
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,850
We’re gonna do Thailand, Japan, and Korea…

204
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,610
We want to bring this to different places,

205
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,600
and continue this discussion about the futures
of different countries.

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,610
So that’s going to be interesting, yeah.

207
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,000
Well since you mentioned the next project,
you know,

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,490
I’ve been told I have a certain, um,

209
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,680
cinematic appeal.

210
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,980
I don’t know if you would consider maybe
casting

211
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,410
me in something, particularly if it involves

212
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,930
sentient machines in the future.

213
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,720
You look like a Matrix!

214
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,990
Something like that.

215
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,259
That’d be good.

216
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,259
Yeah.

217
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,310
If I make a “Ten Years in US,” I’ll
probably cast you.

218
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,950
Well ten years in the future of the US would
be pretty, uh…

219
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,100
I wanna talk about this, because I was in
New York…

220
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Cut the cameras!

221
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,630
Yeah, cut the cameras.

222
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,319
One final question: at the end of the film,

223
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,009
it ends with the phrase, “it’s not too
late.”

224
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,540
I know people are saying that Hong Kongers
have become very

225
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,540
pessimistic and cynical.

226
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,050
Do you feel it’s not too late?

227
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,750
Do you feel there’s still hope?

228
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,259
Well, I think it’s gonna be difficult.

229
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,910
I think the control and censorship

230
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,360
is gonna be even more tightened in Hong Kong.

231
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,860
At the same time, with all the screenings,

232
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,230
we’ve talked to many people,

233
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,800
especially younger generation of Hong Kong.

234
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,550
And we feel they’re all concerned about
the future.

235
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,100
And they really want to fight for something

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,589
they used to enjoy in Hong Kong.

237
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,759
Freedom of speech,

238
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,090
freedom to do their own things,

239
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,220
to have a good jurisdiction system in Hong
Kong -

240
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,060
I think young people are, I think, stepping
up.

241
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,660
I can see the future in them.

242
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,610
It’s gonna be difficult, but I think

243
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,440
but more and more people are gonna fight for

244
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,759
what we used to have as an international city.

245
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,079
And that’s why we think it’s never too
late.

246
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,620
If we lose hope,

247
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,930
then we’re gonna be very pessimistic.

248
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,011
But if we keep the hope,

249
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,510
and keep the hope in people, especially…

250
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,379
That’s how we see it.

251
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,050
Well thank you for joining me, Andrew.

252
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,839
The film is called “Ten Years,”

253
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,120
be sure to check it out,

254
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,319
and keep your eye open for the US release.

255
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,089
I highly recommend the film.

256
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,089
Thank you.

257
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:09,589
- Thanks again.
