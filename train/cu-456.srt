1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,070
Huawei’s deep connections with China’s
military.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,139
Indictments in GE Intellectual Property Theft.

3
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:10,580
And an arresting slap.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,600
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,520
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,789
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,490
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,490
Huawei:

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,950
It’s the Chinese telecom company

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,039
that wants you to know

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,619
it poses no security risk,

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,620
because it totally has no connection

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,480
to the Chinese Communist Party.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,350
Well, it turns out,

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,630
Huawei may actually be partly funded

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,120
by the Chinese Communist Party’s military.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,040
A source speaking to the British newspaper
the Times, said,

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,989
“The CIA accused Huawei of receiving funding

19
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,329
from China’s National Security Commission,

20
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,700
the People’s Liberation Army

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence
network.”

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,930
Okay.

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,770
Just because Huawei may be funded

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,320
by the Communist Party’s state security
apparatus,

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,160
doesn’t mean you should be worried they’re
building

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,180
a backdoor into your phones or 5G networks,

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,829
so the Chinese military can sneak in.

28
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,920
It just might make you think twice about using
Huawei equipment.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,029
Huawei has of course denied all the accusations,

30
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,029
saying the company,

31
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:18,209
“does not comment on unsubstantiated allegations

32
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,020
backed up by zero evidence from anonymous
sources.”

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,950
But it really can’t help that just last
week,

34
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,139
this academic paper,

35
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:29,079
looking at publicly available records, concluded

36
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,280
“Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned.”

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,700
So how much control could the Communist Party

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,639
really have over Huawei?

39
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,060
Let’s just say,

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,890
it’s the Party’s way,

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,890
or the Huawei.

42
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,890
Wait, no.

43
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,890
It’s both.

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,399
They’re the same way.

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,139
Two Chinese men have been indicted for stealing
trade secrets

46
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,880
from the American conglomerate GE.

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,469
Now China will now know the secret to GE’s
success...

48
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,359
well maybe not.

49
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,609
One of the men is a former engineer at GE.

50
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,559
He was charged last August.

51
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,859
But the latest unsealed indictment gave more
details,

52
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,319
“that the alleged theft was conducted to
benefit China,

53
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,799
and that the Chinese regime provided

54
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,069
‘financial and other support’ to the Chinese
companies

55
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,560
that received the stolen information.”

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,159
The two men are uncle and nephew.

57
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,849
It’s a family affair.

58
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,230
Together, the pair are charged with stealing

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,939
electronic files of design models,

60
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,060
engineering drawings,

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,540
and other info about the company’s gas and
steam turbines.

62
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,450
Then, they allegedly “coordinated with Chinese
government officials

63
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,069
to enter into research agreements

64
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,900
with Chinese state-owned institutions

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,859
to develop turbine technologies.”

66
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,439
That’s basically a textbook case of how

67
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,310
the Chinese government steals American intellectual
property

68
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,620
and then puts it in the hands of Chinese companies.

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,060
Turbine theft is big business for the Chinese
Communist Party.

70
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,720
Not just gas and steam turbines, but wind,
too.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,700
Yes, Xi Jinping loves his windmills.

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,209
The Confucius Institute!

73
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,569
It’s everyone’s favorite tool of Chinese

74
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,430
state-backed soft power propaganda.

75
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,730
The Confucius Institute is a free Chinese
language program

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,710
paid for by the Chinese state,

77
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,099
and set up in schools across America,

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,140
and around the world.

79
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,370
You’ll learn useful Chinese phrases like,

80
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,270
Taiwan is part of China’s sacred territory.

81
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,040
And you won’t learn un-useful phrases like

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,139
Tiananmen Square Massacre.

83
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,719
And that’s why it’s so sad that Western
Kentucky University

84
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,280
is getting rid of its Confucius Institute.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
Now how will its students not learn about

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,260
the Tiananmen Square Massacre?!

87
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,680
The decision was made because of

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,739
US legislation created last year

89
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,219
“barring any U.S. university from using
Pentagon resources

90
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,629
for any program involving Confucius Institutes.”

91
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,219
Remember that CCTV reporter

92
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,930
who allegedly slapped a Conservative Party
member

93
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,469
at a Hong Kong democracy event...in London?

94
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,629
Well, that CCTV reporter was charged with
common assault,

95
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,459
but she didn’t show up to her court date.

96
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,510
And now there’s a warrant out for her arrest.

97
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,510
Which is quite a twist—

98
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,639
since a few months ago,

99
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,609
the charges against her had been dropped,

100
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,930
because there wasn’t enough evidence.

101
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,599
Wait, not enough evidence?

102
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,859
Well at some point, the investigation was
opened again.

103
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,039
This does seem like a tough case.

104
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,310
Only a mind like Sherlock Holmes could sort
it out.

105
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,490
Taiwan is working to create a blacklist of
certain tech companies,

106
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,160
and ban them from building critical infrastructure—

107
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,310
things like water and energy supply,

108
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
communications,

109
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,310
as well as government webcams,

110
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,599
servers, and computer software.

111
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,099
Of course this blacklist won’t be dedicated

112
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,680
to any country in particular.

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,880
But I’m sure if there were say,

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,300
a hostile country to the north

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,300
that’s repeatedly threatened to invade Taiwan,

116
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,740
and has tech companies known to work with
that country’s military,

117
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,750
then those tech companies might be targeted.

118
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,060
Speaking of the military,

119
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,379
what about all those elderly Chinese soldiers

120
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,160
who served their country?

121
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,349
Well, the higher-ups want to make sure Chinese
veterans

122
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,850
don’t “disturb social order”,

123
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,770
such as by asking for the retirement benefits
they were promised.

124
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,270
Or by protesting when they don’t get them.

125
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,790
Or by protesting about how the police beat
up

126
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,360
the previous group of veterans for protesting.

127
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,560
That’s why Chinese courts have imposed “heavy
sentences”

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,200
on a group of veterans in eastern China.

129
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,120
18 of them have been sentenced to

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,919
between 2 and 6 years in prison

131
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,020
for “disturbing the social order,”

132
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,440
“intentional assault,”

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,580
or “the crime of preventing officials

134
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,069
from performing their duties.”

135
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,910
There’s no way the Communist Party

136
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,639
going after its own soldiers

137
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,040
will ever come back to bite them.

138
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,830
And finally, think your student loan debts
are bad?

139
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,830
At least you didn’t borrow from a loan shark.

140
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,050
Probably.

141
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,330
Because one Chinese student

142
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,300
did borrow from from loan sharks.

143
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,759
He borrowed about 1,000 dollars,

144
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,259
and in a year,

145
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,879
it ballooned to almost 450 thousand dollars.

146
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,560
Graduates in China often struggle to make
ends meet.

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,270
There’s a lot of graduates,

148
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,509
but not a lot of jobs.

149
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,070
That makes loans hard to pay back.

150
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,830
Plus, a lot of these loan sharks

151
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,010
put on a good show of being legitimate lenders.

152
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,229
So for the first time ever,

153
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,550
I actually feel better about my student loan
debt.

154
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,819
Slightly.

155
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,229
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines.

156
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,129
Now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

157
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,879
a fan who support China Uncensored

158
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,759
with a dollar or more per episode,

159
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,879
by contributing through Patreon.

160
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,890
Charles Walter Brooke asks,

161
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,580
“Chris, what are the percentages of times

162
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,290
you are wearing dress pants vs just shorts,
jeans, or whatever,

163
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,770
while you are filming the episodes?

164
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,099
Well, I hate to break it to you Charles,

165
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,280
but I actually do the whole show in the buff.

166
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,500
I feel more free that way.

167
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,440
This suit... is just CGI.

168
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
By the way,

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
thanks for filming the show Matt.

170
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,439
Matt: I hate this job.

171
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,199
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

172
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,560
who support China Uncensored.

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,729
It’s only because of your support that we’ve
been able

174
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,090
to cover topics that most other media don’t
want to,

175
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,490
because they prefer to get advertising dollars,

176
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,490
or make cars in Xinjiang,

177
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,060
rather than criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

178
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,990
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

179
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,220
See you next time.
