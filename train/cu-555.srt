00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,200
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,660
Gap draws a map of China on a T-shirt—

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,099
but it’s missing all the fun parts.

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,030
China stops importing trash from Europe.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,120
Well, other than its fashion trends.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,930
And a Chinese family raises a cute, cuddly
dog.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,480
Except instead of a dog,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,340
it was a bear.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,160
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,700
Welcome to China Uncensored.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,410
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,110
US fashion retailer Gap is apologizing profusely

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,840
for this t-shirt.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,329
Yes, they are “extremely sorry”

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,000
for the shirt’s “erroneous” design.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,680
What’s that?

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,780
You don’t see what’s so offensive about
this shirt?

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,500
It’s because it doesn’t “respect the
sovereignty

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,579
and territorial integrity of China”!

20
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,330
Which means the t-shirt doesn’t include
Taiwan!

21
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,739
Or the 9-Dash Line that surrounds the entire
South China Sea!

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,829
Gap is just the latest foreign company

23
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,030
that has stumbled onto the Chinese

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,059
sovereignty and territorial integrity landmine.

25
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,090
Recently, the Chinese Communist Party sent
this letter

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,149
to 36 foreign airlines demanding they stop
listing Taiwan

27
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,619
as a separate country.

28
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,850
Although if Gap is apologizing for anything,

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,420
it should really be for trying to make both
khakis

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,220
and swing dancing cool.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,619
In other news,

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,369
realizing just how sensitive

33
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,429
territorial claims on t-shirts can be,

34
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:33,819
a group of Chinese tourists showed up in Vietnam

35
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,600
wearing this—

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,590
the kind of shirt Gap really ought to make

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,680
if they want to stay in China.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,829
It has both Taiwan

39
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,000
and the ridiculous looking 9-Dash Line.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,429
Needless to say,

41
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,590
since Vietnam disputes China’s 9-Dash Line,

42
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,209
people in Vietnam were not too happy

43
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,500
with their new guests’ attire.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,499
In fact, these Chinese tourists were stopped

45
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:59,090
at the airport by security

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,039
and told to remove their shirts.

47
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,249
Still, the photo went viral in Vietnam,

48
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,840
with a lot of internet users there

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,420
calling for the tourists to be immediately
deported.

50
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,079
I’m starting to think that the next world
war

51
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,450
is going to be fought over a t-shirt.

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,840
According to Deutsche Welle,

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,930
China sent Iran a shipment of over

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,459
a thousand tons of sunflower seeds.

55
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,590
Maybe it’s in preparation for the first
annual

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,819
Sino-Iranian Sunflower Seed spitting contest!

57
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,090
China and Iran have pledged to grow trade

58
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,849
to 600 billion dollars a year.

59
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,980
Iran could be an important part of Xi Jinping’s

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,900
Belt and Road Initiative,

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,599
as a physical bridge that could link China
and Europe.

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,489
And since sunflower seed shipment this happened

63
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,989
two days after President Trump announced

64
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,860
he was putting sanctions back on Iran,

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,220
this is probably China’s way of telling
Iran,

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,030
“Hey buddy, we’ve got your back.”

67
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,040
Also, your sunflower seeds.

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
Here’s a quick update

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,709
on the story of the former CIA agent

70
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,600
who is accused of selling out to China.

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Court documents say Chinese intelligence officers

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,780
gave him 100,000 dollars

73
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,980
and promised to take care of him for life.

74
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,140
Well, his alleged selling out

75
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,299
got a bunch of CIA agents killed.

76
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,400
So now it looks the US

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,040
will take care of him for life, too.

78
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,000
China used to take

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,180
almost half of Europe’s plastic trash.

80
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,520
But no longer.

81
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,640
“But an environmental crackdown

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,379
China began last January

83
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,650
has led to a whopping 96 percent drop

84
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,470
in how much it takes.

85
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,840
And now there's a messy problem for Europe:

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,370
What to do with all this leftover garbage!”

87
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,379
Maybe they can ship it here to New York.

88
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,660
No one will be able to tell.

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,760
This footage from Hong Kong Free Press

90
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,290
shows a journalist getting roughed up

91
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,569
by police in Beijing.

92
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,980
The Hong Kong journalist was in Beijing covering

93
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,730
the trial of a right’s activist Xie Yanyi.

94
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,849
Don’t worry,

95
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,310
police let him go to the hospital.

96
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,609
As soon as he signed an apology letter.

97
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,819
And finally, this video from state-run CGTN

98
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,820
shows a black bear that was supposedly

99
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,080
raised as a pet by a Chinese family.

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,260
They thought it was a dog.

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,520
“Honey, something’s wrong with Fido.

102
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,390
He won’t play fetch.”

103
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,390
Funny story,

104
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,290
the same thing happened to me.

105
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,670
The family was so disappointed when they found
out

106
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,340
I wasn’t a puppy.

107
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,600
Sorry mom.

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,210
Thanks for watching the headlines from China
this week.

109
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,990
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

110
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,200
See you next time.

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,380
And time for another question from you,

112
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,850
our loyal supporters on Patreon!

113
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,230
Mark Mathews asks: “Have you read the book

114
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,980
Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party?

115
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,720
Do you recommend it to others?”

116
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,320
Yes, I’ve read it.

117
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,730
And I definitely recommend it to anyone

118
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,420
who wants to really understand

119
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,170
the nature of the communism

120
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,570
and how it’s affected modern China.

121
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,390
It gives insight into how the Communist Party

122
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,800
seized and maintains power.

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
And let’s just say,

124
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,500
the body count is high.

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,590
On that cheery note,

126
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,620
I’ll put a link to the book in the description
below.

127
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,200
Thank you Mark for your question.

128
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,540
And just a reminder to the fans

129
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,200

130
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,730
leave your questions on our Patreon website

131
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,840
and maybe I’ll answer yours next time.
