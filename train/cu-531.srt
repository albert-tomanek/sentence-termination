bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
Guess what s washing up in Chinese Rivers

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,429
Now? Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I m
your host Chris Chappell. Okay, this is not

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,110
funny anymore. When 6000 dead pigs washed
up in Shanghai s drinking water, and the idiot

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,920
authorities said it was still fine to drink,
that was already a bad joke. When that number

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,300
shot up to 16,000, it just stopped being funny.
Then, then they had to find a thousand dead

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,010
ducks in another river, along with a few hundred
more pigs. And the water was still safe to

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,640
drink. I, I don t think these authorities
understand what it means for water to be safe

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,530
to drink. Maybe they just mean it s politically
safe to drink the water, like they won t get

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,879
arrested for it. But come on, seriously! Do
they have to start finding human corpses before

10
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,440
they say the water isn t safe to drink? Of
course that s ridiculous. If you ve been watching

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,569
China Uncensored, you d know, of course, of
course human corpses have been washing up

12
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:01,010
by the hundreds for decades. Recently, authorities
in Lanzhou City in Gansu Province said they

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,390
find about 100 bodies every year in their
part of the Yellow River. That s probably

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,080
a gross underestimation however. Though, really
the truth is even grosser. The Gansu Province

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,100
has become home to a booming business called
body fishing. A body fisher is someone who

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,830
combs the river looking for corpses. They
leave the bodies floating in the water to

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,150
preserve them and then charge the families
about 500 dollars to take a look at their

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,540
deceased loved ones. In this report from 2010,
just one body fisher said he finds about 100

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,720
corpses a year, so yeah, there s more than
100 corpses a year turning up. Of course,

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,090
according to Lanzhou s environmental official,
even though there s hundreds of decomposing

21
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,200
corpses, it s had no effect on the quality
of water. Okay, come on. If hundreds of dead

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,731
bodies doesn t affect water quality what does?!
Unless, maybe the water quality is already

23
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:03,220
so bad, what they re saying is it just can
t get any worse. And they say don drink the

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,720
water when you go to Mexico. Come to think
of it, how many of you have been to China

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,362
and had a glass of water or tea? Of course,
the other unpleasant question this whole thing

26
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:17,600
raises is, why are there hundreds of corpses
in China s rivers? You d think, you know,

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,320
police might want to fish out the bodies and
I don t know, investigate. Authorities say

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,850
most of the victims drowned or died in accidents,
but, well, I think we ve established how credible

29
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,140
Chinese authorities are. The body fishers
say most of the corpses look like suicides

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,080
or murders, but that obviously can t be. Why
just in February China s Ministry of Public

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,021
Security (LINK) reported that China s murder
rate was nearly the lowest in the world, and

32
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:50,640
what few homicide cases there were get solved,
so there s no way these hundreds of unidentified

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,270
dead bodies could be unsolved murder cases.
There s no way. So, what do you think will

34
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,490
be the next thing they find washing up in
China s rivers? Comment below and let me know

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,459
what you think. Thanks for watching this episode
of China Uncensored. Once again I m Chris
