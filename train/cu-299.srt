1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,060
Is China building a new aircraft carrier?

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,859
The US-China Trade War Heats up

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,000
And PUBG gets shot in China.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,340
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,520
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,920
This week's China news headlines:

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,620
Last year, at the request of the US government,

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,340
Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,179
the CFO of Huawei.

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,130
Huawei is the Chinese telecom company

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,330
the US has been warning everyone

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,040
is a national security threat.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,950
Meng is accused of violating US sanctions
on Iran.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,040
And now, after months of waiting,

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,520
we finally have an update.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,880
Meng’s extradition trial is set to begin...

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,810
in January 2020.

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,990
And it could go for any length of time.

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,930
That’s so unfair!

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,480
If only the Canadian legal system

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,350
were more like the Chinese legal system,

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,090
where a foreigner can be sentenced to death
after a quick trial.

24
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,970
Satellite photos of a shipyard outside Shanghai

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,440
show China is building a mysteriously large
ship.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
This photo was published by the Washington-based
think tank

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,800
the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, or CSIS.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
You know what?

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
I can look at satellite photos and comment
about them too.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,160
Doesn’t mean I give myself some fancy pants
name

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,960
like the Center for Strategic looking at stuff.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,600
Here, let me give it a go.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,120
Here’s a photo from the Gobi Desert.

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,220
It’s...a bunch of lines.

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,020
Which could be a secret...thing.

36
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,030
Fine.

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,730
Here’s one from the middle of Kazakhstan.

38
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,070
I know what it is.

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,040
It’s a giant pentagram!

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,430
I have no idea what to make of it, though.

41
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,030
Okay, this is harder than it looks.

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,440
According to CSIS,

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,690
parts of the ship’s hull are over 130 feet
wide.

44
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,460
“Experts said while it was difficult to
be sure,

45
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,590
the size and scale of the new vessel

46
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,370
strongly suggested China's much-anticipated
new aircraft carrier,

47
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,190
referred to as Type 002.”

48
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,850
And Chinese state-run media has been hinting
at it as well.

49
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,950
Okay, that’s a bit more than a hint.

50
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,170
The Chinese Communist Party has been

51
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,200
rapidly trying to build up its navy.

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,090
According to US government reports,

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,950
in two years the People’s Liberation Army
Navy added 32 ships.

54
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,510
Hopefully China’s new aircraft carrier

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,520
will be better than its last one.

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,980
I’m just kidding.

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,730
Hopefully the new one will be a piece of junk,
too.

58
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,230
More on the latest developments in the US-China
trade war.

59
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,280
This Reuters report suggests China may not
have been

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
that serious about making reforms.

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,349
“In each of the seven chapters of the draft
trade deal,

62
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,260
China had deleted its commitments to change
laws

63
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,000
to resolve core complaints that caused the
United States

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,160
to launch a trade war:

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,180
Theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade
secrets;

66
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,200
forced technology transfers;

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
competition policy;

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
access to financial services;

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,209
and currency manipulation.”

70
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,300
I know, we’re all shocked.

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,280
Try to breathe.

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,090
Of course, the Reuters report cites anonymous
sources,

73
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,209
so we don’t know if that’s all true.

74
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,780
But there have been signs that

75
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,800
maybe the trade deal isn’t going as planned.

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,390
That’s okay though,

77
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,780
because the Chinese economy is full of resilience,

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,550
according to state run media.

79
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,290
Yes, the Chinese economy is just chock full
of resilience.

80
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,270
People are practically tripping over the resilience.

81
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,280
And that’s good,

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
because as of Friday,

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
the Trump administration went ahead

84
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,570
and increased tariffs on

85
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,010
200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

86
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,430
It came “after a pivotal round of trade
talks

87
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,700
in Washington on Thursday

88
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,090
night failed to produce a [trade] agreement.”

89
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,290
So what will the Chinese Communist Party do
now?

90
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,030
Well, obviously they’re upset.

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,410
And they’ve vowed to take necessary countermeasures.

92
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,450
What exactly those countermeasures are,

93
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,819
is not clear.

94
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,160
Hopefully it’s deep introspection,

95
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,599
culminating in the realization that it’s
morally wrong

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,849
to steal other people’s intellectual property.

97
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,430
But I won’t hold my breath.

98
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,569
There’s one part of China that’s getting

99
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,379
a lot of love from the US government:

100
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,379
Taiwan.

101
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,030
I mean, the Chinese Communist Party

102
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,250
considers Taiwan a part of China,

103
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,769
so it should be very happy about the new pro-Taiwan
bill.

104
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,909
Okay, obviously the Chinese regime is freaking
out.

105
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:18,909
In the past,

106
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,229
similar bills have brought the threat of war.

107
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,199
And I mean, you know, the Chinese Communist
Party

108
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,740
could soon have an entire fleet of three aircraft
carriers,

109
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,150
some of which might even work properly,

110
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,699
so...watch out.

111
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,990
But here’s the real shocker to this story.

112
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,439
This bill supporting Taiwan was passed unanimously

113
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,990
in the US House of Representatives.

114
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,220
As in 414 to 0.

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,740
I didn’t think that many Democrats and Republican

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,050
could ever agree on anything.

117
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,180
As I always like to say,

118
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,860
the Chinese Communist Party is really bringing
America together.

119
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,129
But if this bill does spark war, be warned—

120
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,810
the People’s Liberation Army fears nothing.

121
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,879
That’s according to this recent video

122
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,020
by state-run People’s Daily.

123
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,080
Here they are, heroically...

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,449
jumping neck deep into a hole filled with
muddy water.

125
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,300
Jumping into a hole filled with muddy water?

126
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,259
Well, at least they’ll be ready for a career
in politics.

127
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,150
Do you like the Chinese style model of mass
surveillance?

128
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,969
Who doesn’t?

129
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:23,310
Certainly not the city of Darwin, Australia.

130
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,419
They’re bringing it home!

131
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,520
Inspired by the Chinese model,

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
they’ll be setting up poles “fitted with
speakers,

133
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,430
cameras and Wi-Fi.”

134
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,419
This will allow the Darwin city council

135
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,300
“to gain data on how many people walk on
what footpaths

136
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,789
and where they use certain websites and apps
in the city.”

137
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,349
It’s what the residents there have always
wanted:

138
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,740
A mass surveillance tool in the hands of the
government.

139
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,759
And finally, are you a fan of the South Korean-made
game

140
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,160
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, a.k.a. PUBG?

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
I mean, pretending to kill people,

142
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,199
what could be more fun?

143
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,499
But if you like PUBG,

144
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,650
I hope you’re not in China.

145
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,889
Because it’s been pulled in favor of a more
patriotic game.

146
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,120
That more patriotic game is called Elite Force
for Peace,

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,270
or Game for Peace.

148
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,840
An expert speaking to Reuters said,

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,639
“It’s almost exactly the same.

150
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,639
The game play,

151
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,639
the background,

152
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,639
the graphic design and the characters,

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
they’re almost the same.”

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,300
Almost.

155
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,080
The new game is apparently more “socialist”

156
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,300
and focuses on China’s air force fighting
terrorists.

157
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
The important part is,

158
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,060
you’re still running around killing people.

159
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,689
But in Elite Force for Peace,

160
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,110
“when you shoot people,

161
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,270
they don’t bleed,

162
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,399
and the dead get up and wave goodbye!”

163
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,860
Yes, that’s what peace is all about.

164
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,020
And it just goes to show:

165
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,960
There’s no foreign intellectual property

166
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,300
Chinese companies won’t rip off—

167
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,139
and make into a slightly stupider version.

168
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,689
This all happened because Tencent,

169
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,729
he Chinese mega company that licensed PUBG,

170
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,490
did not get a license renewal from Chinese
censors

171
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,999
to continue to publish the game.

172
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,840
Tencent got angry and tried shooting the censors,

173
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,659
but the censors just got back up and waved.

174
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,779
So what do you think?

175
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,550
Leave your comments below.

176
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
And now it’s time for me to answer

177
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,819
a question from one of you—

178
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,509
a fan who support China Uncensored

179
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,300
with a dollar or more per episode,

180
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
by contributing through Patreon.

181
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,539
Jeppe Christensen asks,

182
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,639
“Chris, when can we expect to see you

183
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,749
on the top 10 most wanted by the CCP

184
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,229
or do you aim for top 3?”

185
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,999
Oh my gosh,

186
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,199
that would be a dream come true.

187
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,980
Unless of course the CCP really tries to go
after me.

188
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,300
Like, arrest me in Hong Kong level kind of
thing.

189
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,680
Hmm, you know what?

190
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,889
The more I think about this,

191
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,580
the more creeped out I am.

192
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,200
I mean, if they’re even using

193
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,789
Chinese inspired surveillance in parts of
Australia,

194
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,699
I might start to have some problems.

195
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,039
I think I’ll stick to flying under the radar.

196
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,690
Thanks for your question.

197
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,169
And thanks to everyone watching!

198
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,389
We could make this show without your support.

199
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,479
Whether it’s Patreon or just watching

200
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,919
and sharing the show with your friends and
family.

201
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,229
So thank you from me and everyone

202
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,110
on the China Uncensored team.

203
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,439
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
see you next time.
