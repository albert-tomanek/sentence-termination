00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,420
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,510
better dead than -

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,240
Oh my gosh they’re so cute!!!!

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,900
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,960
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,740
Those who don’t learn from history

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,540
are doomed to repeat it.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,680
I learned that from Back to the Future.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,100
That’s why we do uncomfortable things in
school,

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,940
like learn about the Trail of Tears,

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,840
read Uncle Tom’s Cabin,

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,900
or repeat third grade.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,170
But I think something about that whole

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,380
learn from history thing got lost in China.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,500
More than 200 “Red Army schools”

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,950
have sprouted up around China.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,010
Ordinary schools get special funding

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,540
for transforming into these “Red Army schools.”

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,970
The money comes from “China’s ‘red nobility’

20
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,239
of revolution-era Communist commanders

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,290
and their families.”

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,290
Schools like this one

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,289
are taking patriotic education to its illogical
extreme.

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,080
Who needs paved roads when you’ve got

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,860
the glorious spirit of Marxist-Leninist thought?

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,390
And in between spending the school day

27
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,140
singing patriotic songs and discussing Communist
thought,

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,220
it’s always nice to get in a little kung
fu training.

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,470
Primarily because these schools

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,070
don’t have central heating,

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,530
so it’s the best way to get warm.

32
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,210
And I’m sure they get around to studying
science

33
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,520
at some point.

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,930
After they’re done marching in place!

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,159
Oh yeah, he’s having fun.

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,840
And I’m pretty sure this girl could kill
me.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,460
And wants to.

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,100
These red army schools are usually

39
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,130
“built in ‘old revolutionary areas,’

40
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,670
historical cradles of Communist uprisings

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,119
but still often among the country’s poorest
areas.”

42
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,189
If I lived in a rich part of China,

43
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,170
I’d be a bit concerned about the spread
of those

44
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,770
old Communist ideals.

45
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,540
Since those old communist ideals involved

46
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,520
killing rich people and taking their stuff.

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,329
So what revolutionary ideals

48
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,869
are these little red soldiers learning?

49
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,409
"To the communist cause!"

50
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,609
"Love the people!"

51
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:15,629
Yeah...communism is all about...loving...the
people.

52
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,879
I guess these “red nobility” have such
a rosy view of history,

53
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,139
they might have missed the bloodshed.

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,880
“Life has improved so much that children

55
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,549
can’t understand the hardship of those who
built our country.”

56
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,380
Right, professor.

57
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,480
Like all of the adults in the school do.

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,959
I mean, you weren’t around back then either.

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,019
You may have been a child during the Cultural
Revolution,

60
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,239
when schools were shut down

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,689
so kids could play with guns.

62
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,780
But those were Cultural Revolution Red Guards.

63
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,909
These kids are dressing up like the Red Army.

64
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,269
And what do they want to do when they grow
up?

65
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,319
“I want to be a doctor in the future”

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,299
Well, that's actually pretty good.

67
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,479
“So that if other countries invade China,

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,900
I can rescue the dying and heal the wounded.”

69
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,400
Uh...Ok.

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
So why else are you in Red Army school?

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,860
"I want to know our past.”

72
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,811
I think there are a few things that little

73
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:11,821
Susie here

74
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,950
might not be learning about her past.

75
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,060
You see the Red Army was established in the
1920’s—

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,680
a guerilla Communist army dedicated to

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,719
overthrowing the government,

78
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,069
and stealing everyone’s stuff

79
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,499
so they could redistribute it as they saw
fit.

80
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:29,209
Now obviously that didn’t sound too appealing

81
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,799
to a lot of people,

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,919
so the Red Army came up with a compromise—

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,900
kill anyone who disagrees.

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,189
After being nearly defeated by the forces

85
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:40,650
of the previous government of China,

86
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,470
the Red Army embarked on one of the most glorious

87
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,459
and proudly remembered moments

88
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,629
in the Chinese Regime’s history—

89
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,839
The Long March.

90
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,079
What a victory!

91
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,489
More than 80,000 people started,

92
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,059
and only 6,000 made it to the end,

93
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,430
with tens of thousands of soldiers dying

94
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,439
or deserting along the way.

95
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,370
Everyone looked so happy.

96
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,010
Finally, the CCP set up camp in Yan’an.

97
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,400
And boy did their Red Army get busy!

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,920
The CCP treated Yan’an as a revolutionary
holy land,

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,759
a place where they cleansed people’s minds
of terrible,

100
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,079
dangerous things—

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,759
like morality, independent thought, and human
dignity.

102
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,590
You might call it brainwashing.

103
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,400
The CCP at the time called it purging human
nature.

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,539
Ironically, when Little Susie said she wanted
to

105
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,150
"rescue the dying and heal the wounded"

106
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,840
that was actually part of a slogan Mao used
in Yan’an,

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,220
when he said that medical workers

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,060
should practice “revolutionary humanitarianism.”

109
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,460
Right.

110
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,240
Well, the Red Army’s “revolutionary humanitarianism”

111
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,050
included forced confessions,

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,650
self-criticism sessions,

113
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,000
and something called douzheng,

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,690
a term for a particular type of struggle.

115
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,110
And if a person resisted having his thoughts
cleansed,

116
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,180
he would often be tortured,

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,259
or beheaded,

118
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,889
or hacked to death with axes.

119
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,539
The Red Army killed 10,000 people in Yan’an,

120
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,900
including many of its own soldiers.

121
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,669
So yeah, kids these days really don’t appreciate

122
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:16,990
what it was like to be in the Red Army back
then.

123
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,569
But that’s probably not what Little Susie

124
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,289
is learning about the Red Army.

125
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,939
Because the CCP has a way of rewriting,

126
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,669
or shall we say “glorifying” history.

127
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,780
This China Central Television special called

128
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,520
“Ode to Yan’an” is a good example.

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,879
Look at these glorious soldiers on the Long
March!

130
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,699
And here’s Chairman Mao giving a fellow
revolutionary his coat!

131
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,779
I wish I could have been a revolutionary Red
Army soldier back then!

132
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,439
Weird, though:

133
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,900
State-run media left out the parts

134
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,700
about torturing and brainwashing.

135
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,680
So, yes, kids should be educated

136
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,550
about the CCP’s Red Army.

137
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,009
But if history repeats itself,

138
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,930
it might be good if these kids were also taught

139
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,729
about the tragic parts of China’s history—

140
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,009
the way American kids are taught about

141
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,530
the killing of Native Americans and slavery.

142
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,669
Sadly, I don’t think dressing them up in
cute Red Army uniforms

143
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,520
and teaching them to shout communist slogans

144
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,310
is achieving that.

145
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,199
So what do you think of China’s Red Army
schools?

146
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,139
Leave your comments below.

147
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,580
And speaking of armies,

148
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,830
I just want to thank my 50-Cent Army

149
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,229
for supporting the show on Patreon!

150
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,860
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

151
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,160
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

152
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
see you next time.
