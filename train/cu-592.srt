00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,850
it seems the Chinese military is building
missile silos

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,860
in the South China Sea -

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,700
for peaceful purposes…

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,459
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,370
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,280
The Chinese regime is just putting the finishing
touches

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,600
on some of its artificial islands in the South
China Sea,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,830
in an attempt to break the Guinness World
Record

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,180
for the largest ever live-action game of Minecraft.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,850
Watch out for the Creepers.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,879
Maybe that's why they’re allegedly also
building

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,159
missile silos on those islands.

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,170
Two US officials exclusively tell Reuters

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,989
Beijing is almost finished building two dozen
structures

16
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,769
on their artificial islands.

17
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,579
And they’re built to house weapons,

18
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,089
likely long range surface-to-air missiles.

19
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:55,050
Yes, it appears China is building real missile
silos

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,100
on fake islands in disputed territorial waters

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,249
in the South China Sea.

22
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,519
But how do we know these are missile silos?

23
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,570
Well, according to Reuters’ sources,

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,030
they have “retractable roofs,”

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,479
and they “resemble others that house SAM
batteries.”

26
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,240
Well, hey, come on.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,719
That’s not exactly a smoking...missile.

28
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,780
I mean, the retractable roofs could just be for,

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,340
I don’t know,

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,620
elaborate vampire killing devices?

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,710
Or indoor-outdoor swimming pools.

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,380
Or very small football stadiums.

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,490
What was China’s response?

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,130
Well, they admit it,

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,920
but with Chinese characteristics.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
I want to repeat here

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,679
that China carrying out normal construction activities

38
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,250
on its own territory,

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,640
including deploying necessary and appropriate

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,500
territorial defense facilities,

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,899
is a normal right under international law

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,710
for sovereign nations.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,800
So yeah, China is arming the islands they built.

44
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,710
Demonstrating, once again,
China "highly values" peace and stability

45
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,349
in the South China Sea.

46
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,420
Now this is causing huge waves internationally.

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,280
Even more so
than when they finished building that lighthouse.

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,750
Hey, that was kind of scary.

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,010
Fortunately, a US intelligence official told
Reuters

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,000
that these silos aren’t actually a significant

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
military threat.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,420
They’re highly visible and vulnerable.

53
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,580
Just like me.

54
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,690
But why are they building these silos?

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,070
Well according to the anonymous officials:

56
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,670
They say instead it appears to be a

57
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,650
political test of the waters

58
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,159
to see how far Trump will go.

59
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,180
That’s it!

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,799
China began planning and building these missile silos

61
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,950
to test Donald Trump…

62
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,310
a year ago,

63
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,120
before he’d even won the presidential primary.

64
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,430
Proving that the Chinese military

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,840
has already invented time travel.

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
Or was that a Netflix show?

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,160
But there could be another reason.

68
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,200
By building these missile silos,

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,730
the Chinese regime can establish

70
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,879
an Aircraft Defense Identification Zone.

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879
Basically, they could claim rights

72
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,030
to control all aircraft movement

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,459
within a certain area of the South China Sea.

74
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,049
And that could hinder the normal movement
of aircraft

75
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,750
from a number of countries.

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,019
Will the Trump administration push back,

77
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,620
now that this has landed in its lap?

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,760
Well, over the past several years,

79
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,269
the US government hasn’t been very effective

80
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,329
at actually stopping the Chinese regime

81
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,750
from militarizing those disputed islands.

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,190
Sure, the US Navy has sent in ships

83
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,390
to conduct freedom of navigation operations.

84
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,540
But those didn’t stop the construction.

85
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,659
As Rex Tillerson put it

86
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,080
during his senate confirmation hearing,

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,549
China’s activity in this area

88
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:53,599
is extremely worrisome.

89
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,239
And I think again the failure of a response

90
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,769
has allowed them just to keep pushing the
envelope on this.”

91
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,269
So perhaps the Trump administration

92
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,099
wants to push back.

93
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,620
But how could they do it effectively—

94
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,290
and without starting a war?

95
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,860
Perhaps they’ll attempt to use what General
Douglas MacArthur

96
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,459
called America’s “unsinkable aircraft carrier.”

97
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,709
No, not the floating plastic thing

98
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,840
from my favorite childhood board game.

99
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,460
I’m talking about Taiwan.

100
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,780
In December,

101
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,280
when Donald Trump took a phone call

102
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
from Taiwan’s president,

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,690
he proved he was open to use Taiwan

104
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,190
as a negotiating tool with the Chinese Communist
Party.

105
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,840
Trump could use weapons deals

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,120
and diplomatic relationships with Taiwan

107
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,270
as leverage to pressure the CCP

108
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,060
to chill out on its militarization

109
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,710
of those piles of sand.

110
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,389
But hopefully, whatever happens,

111
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,180
it can be executed in a skillful way.

112
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,590
Because World War III doesn’t sound fun.

113
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,169
Especially when China is developing

114
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,200
giant spider tanks,

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
and, of course,

116
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,820
missile silos in the middle of the ocean.

117
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,060
So what do you think?

118
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,650
Leave your comments below.

119
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,490
And to commemorate the completion of the missile silos,

120
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,550
I’m adding yet another new level of support

121
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,650
to our Patreon page!

122
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,460
Help us raise the funds to build our own…

123
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,190
bomb shelter.

124
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,310
And one lucky patron will get to spend the
apocalypse

125
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,789
with me and Shelley.

126
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,100
What’s that, Matt?

127
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh, sorry,

128
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,580
there’s no more room.

129
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,320
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

130
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,400
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

131
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,760
See you next time.
