00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,560
A famous Chinese YouTuber

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,800
Showcases rural life in China

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,800
Everyone loves it

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,760
Especially the Chinese Communist Party

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,120
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
Modern China can be a chaotic place.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,400
Crowded streets. Traffic jams.\h
Police blocking your camera.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,440
Thank Mao there’s a way to relax! Retreat to the\h
countryside. Enjoy the quiet life, the traditional\h\h

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,320
life of a Chinese farmer, like back in the day...\h
before Mao totally didn’t starve farmers to death.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,080
And that brings us to YouTube star Li Ziqi.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:51,680
Li Ziqi’s YouTube channel is all about daily\h
life in rural China. She prepares meals and\h\h

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,080
other tasks for her and her grandmother\h
using only the nature that surrounds them.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,760
Her channel showcases\h
homestyle farming and cooking.\h\h

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,800
She uses homegrown ingredients to prepare\h
dishes in traditional ways. Think farming\h\h

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,680
documentary plus reality TV plus cooking\h
show—all in a colorful, quiet lifestyle vlog.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,640
Some people have called Li Ziqi the Martha\h
Stewart of the Chinese countryside.\h

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Although I don’t think even Martha\h
Stewart plants and picks her own cotton,\h\h

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
so she can turn it into a handmade mattress.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
I mean, who doesn’t love picking cotton!

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
Except obviously half a million\h
forced laborers in Xinjiang.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,280
At any rate, Li Ziqi’s videos are\h
beautifully shot and produced. And\h\h

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,280
they’re hugely popular around the world. She\h
has more than 27 million followers on Weibo,\h\h

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,160
China’s version of Twitter. And she has\h
nearly 15 million subscribers on YouTube,\h\h

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,120
breaking the Guinness world record for\h
most subscribed Chinese language channel.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,120
All of this is great. And I mean that\h
for real. She makes great videos.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,440
But unfortunately, things are\h
never so simple in communist China.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,360
Under China’s authoritarian regime, it’s not\h
always easy when you get too much publicity.\h\h

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,440
Make one wrong move, and you could be\h
in deep trouble. Like in 2018 when a\h\h

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,120
live streamer was sent to jail for singing\h
China’s national anthem in a goofy manner.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
To be fair, I like her version...

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
“Bum bum bum, qi lai!”

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
...at least compared to the official version.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Luckily for Li Ziqi, her content is focused\h
on nature. Her only dialog is with her pets\h\h

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,520
and her grandma. So she’s probably safe\h
from politically motivated censorship.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
In fact, Li Ziqi is more than just safe.\h\h

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Chinese state-run media actively\h
support Li Ziqi’s YouTube stardom.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
“Supporters argue that [Li] has\h
done more to sell Chinese culture\h\h

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
than the Confucius Institute, the\h
government-backed soft power promotional\h\h

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,800
organization with a presence\h
in more than 100 countries.”

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,040
Yes, Chinese state-run media absolutely\h
love Li Ziqi. So much so, that Li was\h\h

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
invited to be the Promotion Ambassador\h
for China’s Communist Youth League.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
And just in case that wasn’t enough,\h
People’s Daily even co-branded with Li Ziqi\h\h

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,520
to sell plum snail powder\h
noodles to her fans in China.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,880
Yes. Plum Snail Powder Noodles. Yum.

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Of course, in many ways it’s great\h
that such a talented person gets\h\h

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,520
good press and opportunities like this.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,840
But it does raise a few questions. Which I’ll\h
get into, after this quick commercial break.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Welcome back. The Chinese Communist\h
Party endorses Li Ziqi’s YouTube channel.\h\h

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
And that brings with it some issues.

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,000
The most obvious one is: How is Li\h
free to use YouTube, which is banned\h\h

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,040
in China? The Chinese government hands\h
out punishments to netizens who access\h\h

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,240
YouTube through a VPN. Like that guy Lonely\h
Fly—who we did a video about just last month.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,840
But Li Ziqi’s YouTube channel\h
somehow gets a free pass.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,760
Another issue is, she’s allowed to promote\h
this kind of traditional culture—the kind of\h\h

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,200
culture Mao tried to wipe out. And she’s doing\h
it at a time when the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,160
wants to promote its Skyscrapers...5G\h
technology... and high speed trains.

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,160
The Party has been trying to bury\h
the memory of laborious farm work...

58
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
and promote everything modern.

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,840
But as it turns out, viewers around the world\h
are actually much more captivated by Li Ziqi’s\h\h

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,000
vivid presentation of China’s traditional farm\h
life than they are by China’s modern technology.\h\h

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
The culture the Chinese Communist\h
Party once tried desperately to destroy\h\h

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,600
is now what’s giving them the\h
positive attention they crave.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
And that’s why Chinese\h
state-run media doesn’t hesitate\h\h

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,320
to approve Li Ziqi. Her videos can promote\h
China’s soft power and global influence.

65
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,000
At the same time, her videos are in line with\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s new campaign\h\h

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,160
of rural revitalization, as well as its ideas\h
of “rejuvenation” of the Chinese nation.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,440
So Li Ziqi can keep her YouTube channel,\h
because of her influence outside of China.\h\h

68
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Li Ziqi carries out the same agenda as Chinese\h
state-run media, only better. It’s almost as\h\h

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,240
if her quiet traditional life snippets are\h
a solution to China’s lack of soft power.

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Soft power has been pretty high up on\h
the Communist Party’s priority list.\h\h

71
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
Back in 2007, then-Chinese leader Hu Jintao\h\h

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
said, “We must enhance culture as part\h
of the soft power of our country.”

73
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,560
And that “We will further publicize the fine\h
traditions of Chinese culture and strengthen\h\h

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,840
international cultural exchanges to enhance\h
the influence of Chinese culture worldwide.”

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,600
“According to Joseph Nye, who coined the\h
term “soft power,” China suffers a soft\h\h

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,520
power deficit for two main reasons – first,\h
the promotion of nationalism, which propels\h\h

77
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,160
an assertive approach to conflicts and antagonizes\h
foreign audiences; and second, China’s soft power\h\h

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,120
does not derive from civil society but from\h
government sources, which lack credibility.

79
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,440
In other words, centralized\h
government power isn’t fun to watch.\h\h

80
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,360
When they come out with rap groups who lay down\h
tracks celebrating the Party’s growing military...

81
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
...people watch that and think it’s garbage.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
But people enjoy Li Ziqi’s videos.

83
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,280
The problem is that they don’t represent\h
the life of a real Chinese farmer.\h

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
And they don’t represent\h
urban Chinese life either.

85
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,080
It’s all an escapist fantasy. Now, although\h
she’s on YouTube, Li Ziqi’s content is\h\h

86
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,840
mostly for a domestic Chinese audience that she\h
reaches through Chinese social media platforms.\h\h

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,640
And it’s a burned-out urban audience\h
that longs to escape to the countryside.

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,640
They know it’s a rural fantasy,\h
but that’s what they want.\h\h

89
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,640
It’s a nostalgia for a way of life\h
that’s gone. If all this sounds familiar,\h\h

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,360
that’s because there’s a Western version\h
of this rural escapism called cottagecore.\h

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,640
I mean, I get it. That’s basically\h
why I play Stardew Valley.\h\h

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
Well, that and my love for Abigail.

93
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,320
But the difference is that Li Ziqi’s escapist\h
fantasy is also great for the Chinese Communist\h\h

94
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Party. Li’s channel and comment section show\h
the beautiful side of China, and it works in the\h\h

95
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,040
Party’s favor that this is on YouTube’s platform.\h
Not only do people outside China get to watch the\h\h

96
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,080
wonders of China’s traditional lifestyle, but also\h
anyone in China who uses a VPN to access YouTube\h\h

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,280
can feel proud of their nation when they see\h
how well received Chinese culture is worldwide.

98
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,600
It’s like the Chinese saying, “Yi Shi Er\h
Niao” 一石二鳥, which literally translates as,\h\h

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,440
“One stone, two birds.”\h

100
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,920
Why does every culture have a phrase about\h
killing birds with stones? Who does that?!

101
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,040
I guess that’s also a way of life that’s gone.\h

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,600
Anyway, the Chinese Communist Party is\h
having more and more trouble maintaining\h\h

103
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,200
a good image around the world. Even\h
before the 2020 CCP Virus outbreak,\h\h

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,040
people in many countries have had\h
increasingly negative views of China.

105
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,440
So to fix this problem, the Chinese regime tries\h
to blur the lines between Chinese culture and the\h\h

106
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Chinese Communist Party. This conveniently\h
fogs up the perception of China as a whole.\h\h

107
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,640
China is beautiful, China is peaceful!\h

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,760
China is definitely not armed with a large\h
military ready to invade its neighbors!

109
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,440
Now, I’m not saying the Communist Party is\h
directly pulling the strings on Li Ziqi like\h\h

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,080
a puppet, and I’m not here to discredit\h
her work. She and her production crew\h\h

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
obviously put a lot of effort into these videos.

112
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,680
But the reality is, Li Ziqi doesn’t represent\h
what life is like for most of China’s 500\h\h

113
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,600
million farmers. Farmers who are mostly\h
suffering under the CCP’s authoritarian rule.

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,760
And FYI, when the CCP claims poverty has been\h
eliminated for them. That’s simply not true.

115
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,280
But life sure is good for Li Ziqi.

116
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,280
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a viewer who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

117
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,280
Ahmad Shumayal asks: “Is OnePlus phone (BBK\h
Group) also guilty of forced labour of Uyghyurs?\h\h

118
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,840
Should we boycott OnePlus as well?”

119
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Good question, Ahamad.

120
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,080
BBK Group is a Chinese conglomerate. And as a\h
Chinese company—even a privately owned one—they\h\h

121
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,040
have to do the bidding of the Chinese\h
Communist Party and the Chinese military,\h\h

122
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,840
if they’re called upon.

123
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
For example, if the CCP asks them\h
to put spyware on their phones,\h\h

124
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
they would have to figure out a way to do it.\h\h

125
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,160
I’m not saying they do. But the US has accused\h
Huawei of spying on mobile phone users...

126
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
so it’s a realistic possibility\h
for BBK’s OnePlus phones as well.

127
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,840
Now I don’t know whether or not\h
BBK Group uses Uyghur slave labor.\h\h

128
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,560
But security concerns alone should be enough\h
to convince you to boycott its OnePlus phones.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
