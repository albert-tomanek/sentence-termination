1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,880
Where did the coronavirus begin?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,600
Anywhere but China, according\h
to the Chinese Communist Party.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,920
What outrageous claims are they making now?

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
This episode is sponsored by\h
Surfshark. You should be using\h\h

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,280
a VPN like Surfshark to protect\h
yourself whenever you go online.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Well gang, happy anniversary! It’s been almost a\h
year since the first reports of the coronavirus\h\h

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,320
or as I call it, the CCP Virus. The CCP\h
Virus that changed our lives forever.\h\h

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
How are you celebrating? I’m hoarding toilet paper\h
again. Never know when the next lockdown might be.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,280
But the Chinese Communist Party is celebrating\h
the CCP Virus anniversary in the only way\h\h

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,440
they know how: by blaming everyone else.
 
You see, over the past year, the Communist\h\h

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,200
Party has been trying to muddy the waters as to\h
where the coronavirus outbreak actually began.\h\h

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,320
And they’ve had some help—from\h
the World Health Organization.\h\h

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,760
Last month, the New York Times released\h
internal World Health Organization documents.\h\h

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,640
And it turns out, they never\h
investigated the origins of the virus.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,520
The documents show how the WHO leadership,\h
“quietly negotiated terms [with China] that\h\h

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,120
sidelined its own experts. They would not\h
question China’s initial response or even\h\h

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,480
visit the live-animal market in the city of Wuhan\h
where the outbreak seemed to have originated.”

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,960
And when Australia called for\h
an international investigation\h\h

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,840
into the outbreak origin, China\h
launched a trade war against them.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,320
That is disgusting. How could Trump do that?!

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,200
Trump really is the best scapegoat. Remember\h
kids, if you forgot to do your homework,\h\h

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,440
just tell your teacher that Trump ate\h
your homework. It’s the perfect excuse.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,240
So the point is, the Chinese Communist Party\h
does not want the blame for the CCP Virus.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Which is why the Party is once again trying\h
to raise doubts about the origin of it.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao\h
Lijian is saying, “Although China was the\h\h

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,800
first to report cases it doesn't necessarily\h
mean that the virus originated in China.”

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,920
Maybe the World Health Organization would’ve\h\h

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,840
backed that up… if only they\h
had been allowed to investigate!

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,640
Zhao Lijian of course famously tried to blame\h
the US military for the CCP Virus back in March.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,120
Later in March, China also tried to blame Italy.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
They did that by “twisting the words\h
of Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi.”

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,120
In an interview with NPR, the doctor\h
had said some other doctors in Italy had\h\h

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,600
said that they “remember having seen very strange\h
pneumonias... in December and even in November.”

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
So Chinese state-run media\h
made it sound like he meant\h\h

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
that the virus was circulating in Italy\h
before there was an outbreak in China.

37
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
You know, secondhand hearsay is\h
not exactly conclusive proof.\h\h

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840
Also, it doesn’t mean it was the\h
same virus. And even if it was,\h\h

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,320
it also could have spread there from China—since\h
3 million people from China visit Italy each year.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Remuzzi himself says that Beijing twisted his\h
words in a textbook example of propaganda.

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
And that he thinks the virus\h
definitely came from China\h\h

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
but spread to Italy earlier\h
than previously thought.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,960
By the way, even the first officially\h
confirmed case in Wuhan was traced back\h\h

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,000
to November. Although the Chinese Communist\h
Party didn’t exactly publicize that fact.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,880
That case isn’t considered patient zero though,\h\h

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,480
so we don’t know when the first\h
case of the CCP virus was.

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
Or as the CCP called it at\h
the time: the Wuhan Virus.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,560
Yes, the Wuhan Virus. Because it came from Italy.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,800
So all that blaming Italy and the US happened\h
back in March. But now, as cases are spiking\h\h

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
around the world, the Comunist Party\h
is once again playing the blame game.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
They’re blaming the US again.

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
And Italy again.

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,840
That’s to be expected. But now,\h
there’s a new contender: India!

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
So let’s take a look at these new,\h\h

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
very legitimate claims the CCP is\h
making. Right after this short break.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,680
Welcome back. The CCP is saying the CCP\h
virus totally didn’t start in China.

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,760
So what excuse do they have for\h
blaming America? This time? Well,\h\h

58
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:11,280
a new CDC study found blood samples in the US from\h
December that had antibodies to the CCP Virus.\h\h

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
That means it got to the US weeks\h
earlier than previously thought.

60
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,560
“This discovery adds to evidence that the\h
virus was quietly spreading around the world\h\h

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
before health officials\h
and the public were aware.”

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Which my favorite Chinese state\h
run media, the Global Times,\h\h

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
takes to mean the virus\h
was in the US before Wuhan.

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,680
It says, “China does not seek to alter the virus\h
origin story as some Western media claimed;\h\h

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
it is a fact that China may have been\h
the whistleblower of the pandemic.”

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes, China was a whistleblower! Just\h
like Li Wenliang, the whistleblowing\h\h

67
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,840
doctor from Wuhan. Chinese police arrested him for\h
whistleblowing. And then he died from the virus.\h\h

68
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,680
And the CCP is a whistleblower just like him. What\h
I take from this is: We should arrest the CCP.

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
As for Italy, Chinese state-run media\h
citing another expert to say the CCP\h\h

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,320
virus didn’t begin in Wuhan. This time\h
it's a German expert; so much better.

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,240
He said, “The novel coronavirus\h
rampant around the world is not\h\h

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
from the central Chinese city of Wuhan,\h
but a mutation from northern Italy.”

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
Except just like with the other doctor in March,\h\h

74
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,600
they twisted his words. After the story\h
broke, he tweeted, “Chinese media are using\h\h

75
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,920
the emergence of the G variant in Italy\h
for propaganda. The #coronavirus pandemic\h\h

76
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,040
originated in China and the outbreak was\h
possibly even concealed at the beginning.”

77
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,760
As for the claims the CCP Virus began in India,\h\h

78
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,640
that comes from, “a team from China’s top science\h
institution, Chinese Academy of Sciences”.

79
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,120
Very trustworthy.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
“The paper, which has not\h
been peer-reviewed yet...rules\h\h

81
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,400
out Wuhan as a site of origin of the\h
Coronavirus but nominates Bangladesh, the US,\h\h

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:24,560
Greece, Australia, India, Italy, Czech Republic,\h
Russia and Serbia as potential countries.”

83
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
That’s a lot of countries. Did they just close\h
their eyes, spin a globe, and then point?

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,440
You know, some people say China doesn’t allow for\h
differing opinions, but that’s simply not true!\h\h

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,200
There are people saying the coronavirus began in\h
the US, Italy, India, so many different opinions!\h\h

86
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,520
But it definitely didn’t begin in China. That’s\h
the only opinion you’re not allowed to have.

87
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Now, this propaganda to get people to\h
believe that the CCP virus isn’t the CCP\h\h

88
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,960
virus may sound laughable. But there’s a good\h
reason that the Communist Party is doing this.

89
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,520
And it’s not just because they\h
don’t want to be blamed. You see,\h\h

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,760
the CCP virus opened a lot of people’s eyes to\h
the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party.

91
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,840
It was a PR crisis for the Party. But\h
with every crisis comes opportunity!

92
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Which is why the Communist Party used\h
the coronavirus to wage a propaganda war.

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,480
And to rehabilitate their image\h
by deploying mask diplomacy.

94
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
That kind of backfired.

95
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,840
But that was eight months ago. Everyone\h
has totally forgotten about that.

96
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,360
What’s important now is that China is\h
winning the global economic recovery.

97
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Which is why you should invest in China!

98
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,560
Plus it’s got a vaccine now.\h
And you know what that means.

99
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
It’s time for vaccine diplomacy!

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,560
The only fly in the ointment is people still\h
remembering how the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

101
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
spread the CCP virus around the world.

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,120
So that’s why Chinese state-run media have\h
to say over and over again that it didn’t\h\h

103
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,720
come from China at all. If they say it enough\h
times, maybe people will start to believe it.

104
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,480
So really what the Chinese Communist Party\h
is saying is, Trump ate their homework.

105
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,280
And this episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.\h\h

106
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,000
Whenever you go online, you should use a\h
VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Because governments and your internet\h
service provider may be watching you.

108
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
But big brother surveillance isn’t\h
the only good reason to use a VPN.\h\h

109
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,440
You can also use Surfshark to access websites\h
that are only available in other countries.

110
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Let’s say you want to watch a TV\h
show about science. I’m talking,\h\h

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
of course, about Rick and Morty.

112
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
But you can’t access Rick and\h
Morty on Netflix in the US.\h\h

113
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,800
So, use Surfshark to switch\h
your location to Mexico,\h\h

114
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,680
log in again, and Wubbalubbadubdub! There it is.\h
That’s my catchphrase. I made it up just now.

115
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
Anyway, if for some reason you\h
don’t want to watch Rick and Morty,\h\h

116
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,720
there are a lot of other movies and\h
TV shows that you can only watch\h\h

117
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,840
if you’re logged into Netflix in another\h
country...by using a VPN like Surfshark.

118
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,880
Another cool feature is, you can connect\h
