1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,180
China is full of crazy rich people.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,359
There are over 800 billionaires

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,160
and more than a million millionaires.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,630
But China’s crazy rich aren’t too crazy

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,460
about the movie Crazy rich Asians.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,800
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,520
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,280
After the critical and commercial success
of Crazy Rich Asians,

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,640
it came as a bit of a surprise when it flopped
bigtime in China.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,350
Well, except for the fact that people had
already predicted

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,980
that it probably wouldn’t do well.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,930
In fact, Chinese movie goers related

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,480
more to Venom than Crazy Rich Asians.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,610
Crazy Rich Asians was translated in Chinese

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,320
as An Unexpected Gold-Digging Romance.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,100
Now I’m not saying she’s a gold digger...

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,829
because the movie really didn’t make a lot
of money.

18
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,559
It only brought in 1.2 million dollars in
tickets

19
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,400
during its opening weekend.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,170
And Chinese movie review sites,

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,920
the reviews were not so good.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,930
This one says:

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,590
“I was told that in the United States,

24
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,200
people are going crazy over the ‘All Asian
Cast’,

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,860
but that’s nothing special in China.”

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,860
Another user writes:

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,710
“It’s like selling American style Chinese
food in China.”

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,922
Others said it, “reinforced the stereotype

29
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:17,880
that Chinese people now are rich,

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,060
and all they do is buy, buy, buy.”

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,530
Which seems weird because in the West,

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,460
it was received as a triumph of representation,

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,540
as well as just a good film.

34
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,590
So what happened?

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,980
Some say American rom-coms

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,100
just don’t do well in China.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,799
The last studio-backed romantic comedy

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,619
to get into Chinese theaters

39
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,990
was Bridget Jones's Baby.

40
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,600
It didn’t even crack a million dollars.

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,350
And like many babies in China,

42
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,079
it simply disappeared.

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,260
Others blame Chinese censors.

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,270
There’s always a big delay between a release
in the West

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,170
and the state-approved release in China,

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,610
since Communist censors have to give any movie

47
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,400
a seal of approval before it’s shown.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
In Crazy Rich Asians’ case,

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,780
that gap was three and a half months.

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,869
“That long vetting period led many industry
observers

51
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,970
(and some studio executives) to conclude that

52
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,309
local censors were uneasy with the film’s

53
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:12,599
ostentatious displays of wealth,

54
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,299
as well as its correlation of Asian with ‘crazy.’”

55
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,290
So not the racial triumph it was viewed as
in the West.

56
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,290
That could be because,

57
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,519
“Chinese audiences still regard the movie...

58
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,219
as American and distinctly foreign.”

59
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,819
Of course, the lag in release could also have
meant

60
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,959
many people had already watched bootleg copies,

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,739
but, that didn’t stop them from watching
Venom in theaters.

62
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,989
For years, Hollywood has been chasing Chinese
money.

63
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,510
They’ve been trying to produce movies

64
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,120
that will be a success in the gigantic Chinese
market.

65
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,439
So, many Hollywood movies gloss over anything
bad in China.

66
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,069
Take Transformers: Age of Extinction.

67
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,699
One of the co-producers was Communist Party
mouthpiece CCTV.

68
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,849
So it’s no wonder that in a movie

69
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,499
the Communist Party had a direct hand in,

70
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,519
when aliens attack Hong Kong,

71
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,839
they know who to call for help.

72
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:07,209
“We’ve got to call the central government
for help!”

73
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,829
So will the flop of Crazy Rich Asians

74
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,459
change things for Hollywood in China?

75
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,699
Not necessarily.

76
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,529
But it does show that the Chinese market isn’t
required

77
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,200
for a movie to be successful and hugely profitable.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,680
And relying on the Chinese market isn’t
sustainable

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,359
for Hollywood over the long term,

80
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,749
as the Chinese government tries to boost its
own domestic films.

81
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,749
So I’m sure Hollywood will learn the correct
lesson

82
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,269
from Crazy Rich Asians’ failure in China

83
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,559
and stop relying so much on that market.

84
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,559
Just kidding.

85
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,230
They’re going to stop making movies with
Asian actors,

86
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,639
and make more campy action movies with Tom
Hardy.

87
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,199
So what do you think about Crazy Rich Asians’
flop?

88
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,709
Leave your comments below.

89
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:48,849
And before you go,

90
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,680
now is the time when I answer a question

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,749
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

92
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:56,060
on the crowd funding website patreon.

93
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,450
Largezo asks,

94
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,959
“Is there a group the CCP has not persecuted?”

95
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,150
Uhhh, that’s a really good question.

96
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,619
They’ve persecuted landlords, capitalists,
intellectuals,

97
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:11,299
artists, students, workers, Christians, Buddhists,

98
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,709
Muslims, rightists, leftists, men, women,
children,

99
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,560
the elderly, and, actually now that I think
about it,

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,979
members of the Communist Party as well.

101
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,570
Which just goes to show you that in a Communist
system,

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,430
everyone is equal...ly at risk of being persecuted.

103
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,050
The Communist Party has even persecuted small
birds.

104
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,509
I’m not kidding.

105
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,280
If you want to hear about that one, let me
know.

106
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,940
Right now, I can’t think of any group

107
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,919
the CCP hasn’t persecuted,

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,939
but if someone can name a group,

109
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,629
leave it the comments below!

110
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,629
