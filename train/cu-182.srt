1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey Google.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,240
I’ve got a search for you right here.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,470
America is spending big to counter the Chinese
Communist Party

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,220
And finally, Chinese people are dying to...

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,170
choose what happens to them after they die.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,820
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,300
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,289
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,289
Our top story—

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,800
an anonymous Google employee has leaked a
secret plan—

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,369
Google is creating a censored search engine

13
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,080
just for the Chinese market.

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,860
It will appeal to the sensibilities of a Chinese
audience.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,860
And by that,

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,331
I mean it censors all the stuff the Chinese
Communist Party

17
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,020
doesn’t want them to know about,

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,700
like the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,840
I guess it’s a good thing Google already
removed

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,440
the “don’t be evil” bit from its code
of conduct.

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,440
We’ll have more on Google in a future episode.

22
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,810
In other news—and this is big, folks—

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,620
Democrats and Republicans have agreed on something:

24
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,940
spending money.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,960
Congress just passed the National Defense
Authorization Act.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,170
It’s the defense policy bill that determines

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,719
the annual budget for the Defense Department.

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,719


29
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,460
Let’s just say it’s a pretty big budget.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,060
And it specifically targets the Chinese Communist
Party

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,780
on a range of issues, like:

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,899
military activity in the south China Sea,

33
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:21,840
theft of US technology,

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,649
and propaganda warfare.

35
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,600
It’s part of a larger trend.

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,729
US lawmakers have finally watched enough China
Uncensored

37
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,859
to figure out that the Chinese Communist Party
has been waging

38
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,240
unrestricted warfare against the United States.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,509
And they’re actually willing to take action.

40
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,649
Of course speaking of US-China war,

41
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,149
I can’t help but think about the current
trade war.

42
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,319
President Trump had threatened a 10% tariff

43
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,479
on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,369
The Chinese Communist Party was not happy.

45
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:59,200
So, Trump decided to double down and make
it a 25% tariff

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
on $200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,430
The Chinese Communist Party...

48
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,679
is even not happier.

49
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,909
And they’ve vowed to retaliate.

50
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,070
While those tariffs are not in effect right
now,

51
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,880
and won’t be until after “a period of
public comment,”

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,430
the Chinese regime is already crying blackmail.

53
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
And they have a point.

54
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,690
I mean, Trump is basically threatening them
with high tariffs

55
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,710
unless they actually start following international
trade

56
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,810
and intellectual property rules.

57
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,810
Which is exactly the same as blackmail.

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,850
And you know, it’s not just that.

59
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,630
Trump is being unfair when it comes to Taiwan,
too.

60
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,690
The US has the audacity to allow the Tsai
Ing Wen,

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,730
President of the Republic of China,

62
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,080
also known as Taiwan,

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,970
also known as the country/region-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named,

64
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,400
to stop over in the US on her way to Belize
and Paraguay next month.

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
I mean, can you believe it?

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,660
The Chinese Communist Party is, unsurprisingly,

67
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,650
demanding that the US stop the stopover.

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,060
Maybe they’re just concerned that she’ll
have

69
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,770
a bad impression of the US.

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,470
Especially if she has a four-hour layover
at LAX.

71
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,540
And finally, why is this Chinese parking lot
full of coffins?

72
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,640
Well, I mean, I get it.

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,740
I know what it’s like to be dying to get
a space.

74
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,070
Get it, because it’s a parking lot,

75
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,140
and...ok moving on.

76
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,400
But in this case, it’s part of a campaign
in southeast China

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,990
to ban coffin burials.

78
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,850
So Chinese authorities are rounding them up...

79
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,410
And destroying them...

80
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,140
Sometimes even during a funeral

81
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,550
I really don’t think that’s showing proper
respect to the dead.

82
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,050
Police are even digging up graves.

83
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,700
So Chinese police literally are grave robbers.

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Wonderful.

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,200
And guys, I’ve seen a lot of movies.

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,910
I know how this ends.

87
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,910
Zombies.

88
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,140
But seriously, this is causing outrage in
China.

89
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,200
On September 1,

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,569
Jiangxi Province officials will implement
a zero burial policy.

91
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,990
That means people will have to be cremated.

92
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,120
A lot of Chinese people are not comfortable
with that.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,510
But when has the Chinese Communist Party cared
about

94
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,200
the feelings of the Chinese people?

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,900
Mao Zedong called China’s burial traditions

96
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,819
a “feudal superstition.”

97
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,630
The same Mao Zedong who has this lovely glass
coffin

98
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,260
in the middle of Beijing.

99
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Though technically,

100
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,220
it was never a burial.

101
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
To give you an idea

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,810
of how passionate Chinese people are about
this,

103
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,240
a few years ago, another Chinese province
tried to do this.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,500
So, before the deadline for no more burials,

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
6 elderly people killed themselves

106
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,640
so they could be buried in the ground.

107
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,240
I mean, at least that’s commitment to tradition?

108
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,250
What do you think?

109
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,479
Leave your comments below.

110
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,850
And now, it’s that time when we answer questions
from fans

111
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,130
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

112
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,130
Guus Schut ask, “Have the people in Xinjiang,

113
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,150
actualy posed a threat when it comes to terrorism?

114
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,680
Is there another side to the stories

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,970
or has the CCP made up this story?

116
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,440
Interesting question.

117
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,090
As many of the folks watching know,

118
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,620
Xinjiang is home to the Uighur ethnic minority,

119
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,970
which is mostly Muslim—

120
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,870
or at least come from a Turkic culture.

121
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,020
And despite all the love the Chinese Communist
Party gives,

122
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,370
just like those no good Tibetans,

123
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,900
there are those in Xinjiang

124
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,940
who want freedom and independence.

125
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,490
These people call Xinjiang, East Turkestan.

126
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,220
Which is why for years,

127
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,210
they were referred to as separatists or splitists.

128
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,860
That’s the same language used against Tibetans.

129
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,540
But following the terrorist attacks of September
11,

130
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,950
the Chinese regime had a brilliant idea.

131
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,310
Let’s start calling them terrorists!

132
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,060
And while that term had been leveled against
Uighurs before,

133
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,310
the party doubled down after 9/11.

134
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,000
As this Jamestown Foundation piece put it,

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,460
“There is no doubt that China has taken
advantage of

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,490
the world campaign against terror

137
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,520
in order to serve its domestic politics and
foreign pursuits.

138
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,580
For the first time,

139
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:13,000
China felt unconstrained in using force.”

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,550
And language is powerful.

141
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,240
When you call a bunch of Muslims terrorists,

142
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,620
it makes it a lot harder for them to get international
sympathy,

143
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,560
even if they’re being severely abused by
the Chinese regime.

144
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,030
Is there what we in the US would call

145
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,440
terrorism going on now in Xinjiang?

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,500
Well, the Party has not provided

147
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,210
much convincing evidence of terrorism.

148
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,960
Even so, it wouldn’t be too surprising.

149
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,210
They’ve been oppressed for decades.

150
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,410
They have no outlet to speak.

151
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,170
They’re being forced to abandon their religious
traditions.

152
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,010
It’s possible—just possible—

153
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,840
that the Communist Party’s actions

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,419
are actually creating the urge to be terrorists.

155
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,000
But also—and this is probably the majority
of cases—

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,050
people who are not criminals

157
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,010
are being charged with the terrorist label.

158
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,760
But really, with the lid the Chinese regime
keeps on things,

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,490
we may not ever know what’s really going
on in Xinjiang.

160
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,800
Thanks for you question, Guus.

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
And before you go,

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,180
I’d like to ask all of you:

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,520
Hey, if you haven’t heard,

180
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,290
we have a new podcast,

181
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,639
China Unscripted.

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,680
Along with Shelley, and Matt the producer,

183
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,830
I go into way more detail than we ever could
on the show,

184
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,110
which means more jokes too.

185
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,750
So subscribe to us on iTunes.

186
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,060
Once again that’s China Unscripted.
