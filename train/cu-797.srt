1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,590
The Chinese Communist Party has been exposed

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,120
The tactics the Party uses to undermine democracy

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,760
have been laid bare

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,220
And countries around the world react

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,900
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,380
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,790
For years, the Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,340
has been extending its tentacles into every
level of society

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,960
in democracies around the world.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,480
But before the CCP’s plans for world domination
can succeed,

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,640
some people are beginning to take notice.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,020
In 2018, Clive Hamilton,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,430
a professor of public ethics

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,220
at Charles Sturt University in Australia,

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,020
released Silent Invasion:

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,240
China’s Influence in Australia.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,711
It’s an indepth look at the tactics the
Chinese Communist Party

18
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:50,180
has been using to undermine democracy and
push its own agenda.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,940
Ironically, his initial publisher dropped
the book

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,090
because of fear of a backlash.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,570
But after a new publishing company put out
the book,

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,060
it became a canary in the coal mine.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,120
Australian society began fighting back.

24
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,299
And today, Clive Hamilton joins me in the
studio

25
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,979
to discuss the progress that’s been made
over the past year

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,740
since the book was published,

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,380
and what more needs to be done.

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,820
Clive, it's great to speak with you again.

29
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,700
Are you still facing as much harassment from
your work

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,240
that's as when I first met you a year ago?

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,540
It's a bit hard to tell.

32
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,819
Obviously, I and others who do the kind of
work I do

33
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,860
need to think a lot and take measures about
security,

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,299
both cyber and otherwise.

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,620
So yep, it's a different world I move in now.

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,780
I bet!

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,100
Since your book Silent Invasion painted such
a bleak image

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,780
of how the Chinese commies party was influencing

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,329
all levels of Australian society,

40
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,719
has there been a change since it was released?

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,499
Well, it's certainly been a big shift in Canberra

42
00:01:53,499 --> 00:02:00,750
in attitudes towards Chinese Communist Party
influence operations.

43
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,159
It's now widely understood that it's a big
issue,

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,369
a big problem for Australia.

45
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,220
The major news organizations

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,760
are onto it and they're looking for good CCP
influence stories,

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,650
and coming up with some terrific ones.

48
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,260
And the federal government has introduced
a number of measures,

49
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,690
including legislation which has been passed
by parliament

50
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,390
on a bipartisan basis.

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,440
Introducing a new criminal offense known as
foreign interference.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,060
And there are a number of other legislative
and administrative measures

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,079
that the Australian government has taken.

54
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,049
So there's certainly a desire to push back

55
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,379
and there's a kind of structure in place now

56
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,520
which has attracted a lot of attention around
the world

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,340
from other countries including the United
States and Canada

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,640
to see what's happened in Australia

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,180
and whether our pushback strategy is being
effective.

60
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,670
It's a bit soon to say.

61
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,750
We've yet to see whether the new laws will
bite

62
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,409
or whether that means there will be prosecutions

63
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,000
or whether it means that Beijing

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,290
and its agents of influence in Australia

65
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,910
will change their strategies to stay on

66
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,549
the right side of the new laws.

67
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,599
So we won't know for a couple of years,

68
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,450
but certainly the atmospherics have changed
a great deal.

69
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,710
So people are talking about the issue a lot.

70
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,180
Specifically these foreign interference laws.

71
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,940
What do they do?

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Well, the foreign ...

73
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,110
Well, let me get to the foreign interference
lawyer of several others.

74
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,099
There's a foreign interference ...

75
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,159
Sorry, foreign influence transparencies game,

76
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,329
which is modeled on the US FARA law,

77
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,799
which means that people who are trying

78
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,939
to influence political processes on behalf
of a foreign government

79
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,799
have to put their names on a register

80
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
and that's just come into operation.

81
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,769
The laws governing foreign,

82
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,520
particularly Chinese investment in Australia's
critical infrastructure,

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,219
electricity supply, gas supply-

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,760
Is 5G included in that?

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,480
Telecommunications.

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,600
The Australian government has announced that
Huawei and ZTE

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,770
are simply banned from putting their equipment

88
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,080
into Australia's 5G network.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,370
And so the Australian government really led
the world on that

90
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,770
and it's a big question of whether the rest
of the Five Eyes nations

91
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,000
will follow suit.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,949
And the various other measures,

93
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:42,640
but I think the central measure is the foreign
interference law.

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,699
And what that does is it defines

95
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,350
a new offense called foreign interference,
which ...

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,759
And foreign interference generally described
is foreign influence,

97
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,500
which is a covert coercive or corrupt.

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,550
And what it means is that any act

99
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:10,330
which is undertaken in a secretive way on
behalf of a foreign principle,

100
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,550
which can mean a foreign power or big corporation,

101
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,139
which is close to a foreign power-

102
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,949
Or a host of a show in a foreign country?

103
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,190
Certainly.

104
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,090
And if that host in the media

105
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,870
is trying to influence a government process,

106
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,370
or interfere in the democratic right of someone
in Australia,

107
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,479
then they are committing a criminal offense

108
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,180
and there are large penalties for them.

109
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,210
So this is really radical because it's a new
world

110
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,310
that governments are trying to come to grips
with.

111
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,610
It's not espionage.

112
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,590
Yes, espionage laws cover certain things,

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,820
but then there's this huge gap,

114
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,080
this gray area which the Chinese Communist
Party has been exploiting

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,620
in all kinds of countries.

116
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,819
And so the foreign interference law is a way
of trying to turn

117
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,680
some of that gray area black,

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,680
so that if you do that kind of stuff,

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,319
you could end up in jail.

120
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,090
So these foreign interference laws don't mention
China specifically?

121
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,090
No.

122
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,110
However, when the law, the bill,

123
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,380
was introduced to parliament by Prime Minister
Malcolm Turnbull,

124
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,300
former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull,

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,080
in his speech he specifically mentioned China.

126
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,250
And that caused a great deal of angst and
irritation in Beijing.

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,590
But it was a very bold move by Prime Minister
Turnbull

128
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,830
to finger China and the Chinese Communist
Party specifically.

129
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,290
So there's no doubt in anyone's mind that
this law is directed at China.

130
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,620
We don't have Russian interference in Australia,
not to speak of.

131
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
That you know of.

132
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,490
Well, maybe they are particularly clever and
they've gone under the radar.

133
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,470
But yeah, this law is about China.

134
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,539
Now, I know you talked about the risk of 5G

135
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,110
from Chinese telecommunications companies
like Huawei or ZTE.

136
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,160
What is the risk these companies and their
5G pose?

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Well 5G, the fifth generation of mobile telecommunications

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,560
will completely transform the way our lives
operate

139
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,699
in the sense that they won't just govern our
cell phones,

140
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,250
but they'll also be crucial for all kinds
of communications

141
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,610
and industrial management processes.

142
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,040
Driverless cars, for example, will be operated
through the 5G-

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,180
Smart cities.

144
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,639
Smart cities, the whole box and dice.

145
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:50,449
CCTV, factual recognition, everything will
be a operated through 5G.

146
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:56,080
So if you have the potential for a foreign
adversary

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,950
who could at some point become an enemy with
essentially controlling

148
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,700
or having access to the equipment that organizers
transmits, 5G,

149
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,729
then you've got a major national security
issue on your hands.

150
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,750
And that's why Australia banned Huawei and
ZTE,

151
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,169
and why the US government hasn't formally
banned them,

152
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,510
but I believe is on the verge of doing so.

153
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,960
And similarly, New Zealand has banned those
companies.

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,190
Canada and the UK are the other two of the
Five Eyes nations,

155
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,219
are agonizing, coming under a huge amount
of pressure from Beijing

156
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,529
to allow Huawei into their networks.

157
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,390
But also their security services are saying,

158
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,000
"This would be crazy to do it."

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
So the governments are trying to make up their
minds still.

160
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,570
Well, speaking of the Five Eyes nations,

161
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,790
how do you think they are doing at handling

162
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,690
Chinese Communist Party's influence?

163
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, Beijing would like nothing more than

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,180
to divide the Five Eyes nations.

165
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,170
To have the United States, for example,

166
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,470
unwilling to communicate or discuss it's secrets

167
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,850
with Canada or the United Kingdom.

168
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,010
This will be a major victory for Beijing-

169
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,350
Because for instance, they've used Huawei
Telecom infrastructure.

170
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,350
Exactly.

171
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,560
If Britain in particular had Huawei equipment
in it's 5G network,

172
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,350
and the United States and Australia and New
Zealand said,

173
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,110
"We're not going to have them."

174
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,700
We'll now have their, I'm guessing,

175
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,890
their international hookups to discuss the
deepest secrets

176
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,230
that they have about CCP interference for
example,

177
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,260
or activities in the South China Sea.

178
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,589
You name it.

179
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:56,300
The United States has flagged that it will
be reluctant

180
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,360
to communicate its secrets through a 5G network

181
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,660
because you won't be certain that it is secure.

182
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,340
That would be a big victory for Beijing

183
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,370
and so it's very worrying that the UK can't
make up its mind.

184
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,240
Germany is not in the Five Eyes,

185
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,040
but kind of close to it,

186
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,970
is also in the throes of trying to make up
its mind on this question.

187
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,779
So that's why Huawei's so important to Beijing

188
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,320
for its global program of influence and espionage.

189
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,390
So even if one of the Five Eyes nations used
Huawei infrastructure,

190
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,399
that would be a big victory for China

191
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,130
because then essentially that one country
would be excluded

192
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,339
and then you only have Four Eyes,

193
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,540
which doesn't really sound very-

194
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,680
It doesn't sound very good.

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,610
It sounds more like an insult then then a
secrecy pact.

196
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,310
Yeah, I think to a degree ...

197
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,550
It's a bit hard to say, but put it this way.

198
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,000
The the fifth I would would have to put

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,570
a very persuasive case to the other four,

200
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,680
not to quarantine them from the secret network.

201
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,810
And so Huawei is crucial for that reason,

202
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,079
but also it's the biggest telecommunications

203
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,269
equipment supplier in the world.

204
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:27,350
Kelley communications is growing in importance.

205
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,329
The only major competitors are from Europe.

206
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,390
There are no major US suppliers

207
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,480
of this kind of telecommunications equipment.

208
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,079
And so Beijing believes it can dominate

209
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,950
the global telecommunications market

210
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,510
and all of the implications of that through
through Huawei,

211
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,019
which is why when Canada, at the request of
the United States,

212
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:05,340
arrested they chief financial officer of Huawei
Meng Wanzhou in Canada,

213
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,680
Beijing has been desperate to get her back.

214
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
This is a really big deal for Beijing,

215
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,350
and indeed it is for Canada and the United
States as well.

216
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,100
So with all this, do you think the Australian
government has done enough,

217
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,190
or what would you like to see done?

218
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,690
I think we're seeing the start of the pushback
even in Australia.

219
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,579
We need to say the laws enforced.

220
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,420
We need to see people prosecuted under them.

221
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,370
There are a whole lot of other administrative
measures.

222
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,570
For example, the Australian government has
slowed down,

223
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,870
and in some cases stop the visas of Chinese
scientists

224
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,990
coming to Australian universities to work
with Australian scientists,

225
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,699
particularly on high tech research.

226
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,810
Some of which has military applications.

227
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,870
And when it was discovered that some of the
Chinese scientists

228
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,600
coming to Australia to work on cutting edge
technologies,

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
some of them are actually officers of the
People's Liberation Army.

230
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,310
This sent a chill through the intelligence

231
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,529
and defense networks of Australia.

232
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,670
They didn't know that until it was revealed,

233
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,750
particularly through the research of Alex
Joski.

234
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,649
And the same thing is happening in the United
States,

235
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,209
in Canada and elsewhere.

236
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:25,760
So we're just waking up to this level of penetration,

237
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,290
and I think we've got a long way to go before
we understand

238
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,820
the full nature of influence and interference
and develop

239
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,850
the tools to protect national sovereignty

240
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,870
and democratic institutions from CCP interference.

241
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,910
Now I know in Silent Invasion you make it
very clear

242
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,820
that you are talking about Chinese Communist
Party,

243
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,990
not the Chinese people or Chinese Australians.

244
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,350
And yet you still get accused of racism.

245
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,070
Not just by Chinese officials but by other
Australian politicians.

246
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,080
Yes.

247
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,579
How do you deal with that?

248
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:05,029
Well, fortunately I'm quite confident in the
fact that

249
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,810
I'm not an anti-Chinese racist.

250
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,990
I've got a pretty good history going back
some decades of calling out,

251
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,970
arguing against, writing about, researching
racism in Australia.

252
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,360
But what of course the Communist Party propaganda
department does

253
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,090
is attempts to ... When people like me make
claims

254
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,110
about Chinese Communist Party influence,

255
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,430
they try to throw sand in our eyes

256
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,880
with this accusation that it is anti-Chinese

257
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,540
and that any criticism of the Chinese Communist
Party is a defamation.

258
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,510
A libel against the Chinese people.

259
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,610
But the truth is that quite a lot of the work

260
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,690
that went into my book came from Chinese sources,

261
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,959
Chinese Australian academics, Chinese Australian
journalists.

262
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,880
The book itself was launched in Sydney

263
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,670
by a large group of Chinese Australians.

264
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,480
And a few weeks ago, a Chinese language edition
of the book

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,690
was published in Taiwan and is already selling

266
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,029
well I'm told in Hong Kong, in Taiwan.

267
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,700
So it's a very intense interest.

268
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,509
Because the point is in all of this, Chris,

269
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:26,529
that the greatest victims in Australia

270
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,040
of Chinese Communist Party influence activities,

271
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,570
are Chinese Australians.

272
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,220
And so it's regrettable, let's say, to use
a mild word,

273
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,290
that some Australian politicians

274
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,880
and also some academics and Sinologists,

275
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,220
not to mention a CCP activists on social media,

276
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,880
constantly make this accusation.

277
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,320
What we've seen though is that people from
both the left

278
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,569
and the right of politics in Australia,

279
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,070
and the left of the right,

280
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,750
are public debate in Australia,

281
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:12,910
have woken up to the threat of CCP interference
in Australia.

282
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,930
So it's as in the United States.

283
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,350
I've just been in Washington DC, and resisting,

284
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,220
pushing back against CCP influence in the
United is,

285
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
I think it's true to say,

286
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,050
the only major issue where there is a bipartisan
position.

287
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,000
It's really amazing how the communist party
can bring us all together.

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes indeed.

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
And there's no accident.

290
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,139
I mean, I mean people on both the left and
the right

291
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,130
value and love the democratic institutions.

292
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,980
The freedom of speech, the national sovereignty,

293
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,829
the projection of parliament or government
from foreign interference.

294
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,300
That cuts across the ideological spectrum,

295
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,029
or at least it should.

296
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,040
Ideally.

297
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,880
Are you aware that often Chinese media,

298
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,220
will use the words of,

299
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,730
the criticisms of Australian politicians against
you in their reports?

300
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,530
Yeah, I've noticed that.

301
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,150
There was a particularly rabid article in
the global times,

302
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,690
the Communist parties kind of nationalist
tabloid.

303
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:26,970
And in it's English language version it launched
an attack on my book.

304
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,530
And the way it did it was it quoted prominent
Australian politicians

305
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,540
who like Bob Carr, who's sometimes known as
Beijing Bob.

306
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,850
Not by me, but others, Paul Keating and a
number of others,

307
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,790
who vigorously attack me and my book for its
alleged racism.

308
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,330
And of course the Global Times were very happy
to quite them.

309
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,140
And it accompanied this story with a mock
up photograph of my book,

310
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,860
Silent Invasion, being flushed down a toilet.

311
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,600
Sometimes CCP propaganda can be quite scatological.

312
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,630
But my question,

313
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,410
was it a regular toilet or a squat toilet?

314
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,070
It was a western style toilet.

315
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,640
Hey, that's not so bad.

316
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.

317
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah.

318
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
All right.

319
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Well, Clive, thank you very much for joining
us today.

320
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,070
It's a pleasure catching up with you and hearing
good news.

321
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,140
Would you say?

322
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,820
I think there are grounds for optimism,

323
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,170
where we were all pretty pessimistic two years
ago.

324
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,850
So the Western world, the democratic nations
are starting to push back.

325
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,050
It's only the beginning.

326
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,430
We won't know whether it succeeds for another
10 years,

327
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,860
but at least things have turned in Washington
and in Canberra,

328
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,780
and even in Canada.

329
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,320
And so I think there are grounds

330
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,060
for believing that we can protect our democratic
institutions

331
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,320
from the influence of this authoritarian power.

332
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,000
So yeah, I'm moderately optimistic.

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Moderately optimistic.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,310
I'll take that.

335
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,310
Thanks, Chris.

336
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
Thanks for joining us today.

337
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,300
Cheers.

338
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,140
Thanks for watching the interview with Clive.

339
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,320
He actually has much more to reveal to us.

340
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you want to give us a sample?

341
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,220
Well, I've been in Canada and in Washington,

342
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,340
and there's been some pretty extraordinary
revelations

343
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,800
about the extent of CCP influence.

344
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,470
Canada and the United States are really

345
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,271
just starting to come to terms with it.

346
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,810
So it's big stuff.

347
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,860
So if you want to hear some of those extraordinary
revelations,

348
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,820
