00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,960
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,680
Move over, Global War on Terror,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,660
now it's the People's War or Terror!

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,300
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,200
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,320
China is a land of diversity.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,800
There are 56 officially recognized ethnic
groups!

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,860
Although about 92% of people

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,829
are from the Han ethnic group.

10
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,099
But the important thing is that they all live
in harmony

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,269
under the loving guidance of the Chinese Central
Government.

12
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,670
Like Tibetans!

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,079
Those rooftop snipers are there to keep everyone safe.

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,800
Same goes for the less-talked about groups

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,960
like the Uyghurs,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,789
a Turkic minority in the Xinjiang region.

17
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,839
Thousands of heavily armed troops

18
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,789
have marched through cities in Xinjiang

19
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,280
over the past week,

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,329
in mass military demonstrations.

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,040
As the region’s deputy Communist Party chief
says,

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,059
it’s to show “the caring and strong leadership

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,510
of the Communist Party Central Committee.”

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,220
Also to show that “all separatist activities
and all terrorists

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,780
shall be smashed to pieces.”

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,560
How will they do that?

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,620
With the "powerful fist of the People's Democratic
Dictatorship" of course!

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,130
You know about the Chinese military’s,

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,210
um, benevolence, in Tibet.

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,850
People in the West are pretty familiar with
the political situation there,

31
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,790
thanks in part to Gwyneth Paltrow-era Brad
Pitt,

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,310
and notorious foam visor lover, the Dalai
Lama.

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,680
Well, the same kind of Chinese military “benevolence”

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,659
happens on a regular basis in Xinjiang, too.

35
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,689
Xinjiang is a giant region in Western China

36
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,060
with roughly the land area of Alaska.

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,979
Like Alaska, it’s mostly uninhabitable.

38
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,360
And they also can see Russia from their backyards.

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,450
But unlike Alaska,

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,310
Xinjiang's reality shows have never really
taken off.

41
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,760
Sand Road Donkeys:

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,640
Truly an underappreciated gem.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,580
But the ethnic Uyghurs living in Xinjiang

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,109
don’t get much media attention

45
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:03,570
compared to Tibetans.

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,570
Why?

47
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,930
Well, they don't have a lovable religious
leader

48
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,690
to be their spokesperson.

49
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,990
And it might also be because they’re Muslim.

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,750
Not Muslim extremists generally;

51
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,390
mostly moderate Muslims.

52
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,380
But the Communist Party doesn’t like moderate
Islam

53
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,460
any more than they like moderate Buddhism.

54
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,910
Any system of belief in a higher power

55
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,080
is seen as a threat.

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,260
So how to solve this problem?

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,050
For decades, the Communist Party has flooded
the region

58
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,000
with non-Muslim ethnic Han Chinese.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,670
Which has now increased to 38% of Xinjiang’s
population.

60
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,210
And the CCP has recently implemented a loving,

61
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,530
big brother system of mass surveillance

62
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,580
like “grid management, face recognition
software

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,250
and big data analytics.”

64
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,250
And of course,

65
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,950
who could forget all the things the CCP

66
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,120
has banned in Xinjiang at various times,

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,070
because they’re too dangerous:

68
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,220
Beards, veils, traditional clothing, the internet,

69
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,550
and even, for civil servants,

70
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,060
fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,940
Hey, fasting is dangerous.

72
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,200
You’re not yourself when you’re hungry.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm looking at you, Betty White.

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,180
Now it used to be that Uyghurs who were not
fully supportive

75
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,370
of their benevolent communist overlords

76
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,150
were called “splittists”—

77
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,480
the same term used for Tibetans.

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,340
But after 9/11,

79
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,830
the Communist Party adopted a more politically
savvy label:

80
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,010
terrorists.

81
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,430
According to Beijing Cream,

82
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,520
“Everything—from the theft of sheep to
a land seizure protest

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,990
to a fight with knives—

84
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,130
can now be labeled as ‘terrorism,’

85
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,370
as long as Uyghurs and Han are involved in
the conflict.”

86
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,900
It’s lead to what state-run media are calling

87
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,680
“the People’s War on Terrorism.”

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,430
And if your neighbor turns you in

89
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,340
for being a terrorist sympathizer,

90
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,790
which they get a reward for by the way,

91
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,840
you might find yourself subjected to,

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,430
shall we say,

93
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,250
“enhanced interrogation techniques.”

94
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,630
Unless you then turn in your other neighbors

95
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,830
for being terrorists.

96
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,590
I mean, that technique worked so well

97
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,560
during the Cultural Revolution.

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,850
That's why there's not a single counter-revolutionary

99
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,760
left in China today!

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,480
Fortunately, the Party has put up colorful
propaganda

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
to educate the Uyghurs

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,670
about potential terrorist activities.

103
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,090
Like sharing banned information on video CDs.

104
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,090
Or installing a satellite dish.

105
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,509
News is dangerous.

106
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,509
And don’t wear veils.

107
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,340
You’ll be much happier without.

108
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,680
And if those birds become a problem, why,

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,520
there’s always friendly soldiers nearby

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,750
to shoot them down.

111
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,660
So if you see a group of Uighurs

112
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,449
happily reading Party propaganda

113
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,340
in front of a Chinese flag,

114
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,060
you can bet it has something to do with

115
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,819
the Xinjiang party chief saying,

116
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:47,250
“We shall load our guns, draw our swords
from their sheaths,

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,750
throw hard punches and relentlessly beat,

118
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,400
and strike hard without flinching

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,440
at terrorists.”

120
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,870
All under the watchful eye of the 40,000 security
cameras

121
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,940
set up in Xinjiang’s streets, public places,
and mosques.

122
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,430
And now the latest news,

123
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,260
they're going to use GPS surveillance

124
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,530
to keep track of every car in the region.

125
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,610
This is not to say there are no real terrorist
problems

126
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,610
in Xinjiang.

127
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,639
It’s just that when the persecution of Muslims
in Xinjiang

128
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,080
becomes severe,

129
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,840
I imagine that Islamic extremists around the
world

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,599
will have an easier time convincing otherwise
peaceful Uyghurs

131
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,520
that violently rising up against the Chinese
government

132
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,999
is their only option.

133
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,539
Don’t worry though,

134
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,270
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has a plan.

135
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,729
“Build a ‘wall of bronze and iron’

136
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,110
to fight against terrorism.”

137
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,320
A wall?

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,110
This sounds like a job for Matt Damon.

139
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,110
So what do you think of the

140
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,270
"People's War on Terrorism" in Xinjiang?

141
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,199
Leave your comments below.

142
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,030
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

143
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,729
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

144
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,109
see you next time.
