00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,360
China’s new national defense law

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,880
Means Xi Jinping gets new war powers

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,400
And it gets even worse from there

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,320
Because YouTube has been unsubscribing people.\h
I know some people find that hard to believe,\h\h

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
so if you’ve been unsubscribed by\h

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,800
The new year! is A time for new beginnings. And\h
what is Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s New Year’s\h\h

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,640
resolution? You guessed it! He’s going to cement\h
his hold over the military with new war powers!

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,040
Weight Watchers was a close second. Followed\h
by organizing a cross-strait family reunion.\h\h

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,600
Everyone in Taiwan is invited! The\h
reunion will be at your place.\h

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,040
But let’s talk about Xi Jinping’s new war powers.\h\h

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
A revised national defense law went\h
into effect in China on January 1st.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,720
And that law means that China’s military\h
is taking charge of more war powers.\h

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,720
What powers? Well the powers of\h
global justice of course—according\h\h

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
to my favorite state-run media The Global Times.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
It’s all about global justice\h
and “safeguarding world peace.”

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
Because there’s no better way to safeguard\h
world peace than to give the Chinese Communist\h\h

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Party more military control. And that’s\h
what this national defense law does.\h

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,760
“Revisions to the National Defence Law...weaken\h
the role of the State Council in formulating\h\h

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,200
military policy, handing decision-making\h
powers to the Central Military Commission.”

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
And guess who’s in charge of\h
the Central Military Commission?

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
I feel safer already.\h

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,240
Giving this military policy decision-making\h
power from the State Council\h\h

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,120
to the Central Military Commission is big.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,960
According to one military law expert,\h
“The [Central Military Commission] is now\h\h

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,760
formally in charge of making national\h
defence policy and principles, while\h\h

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,600
the State Council becomes a mere implementing\h
agency to provide support to the military.”

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,960
The State Council is part of China’s Central\h
Government. It’s headed by Premier Li Keqiang.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission\h
is under the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
And it’s headed by Xi Jinping.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
Ok, technically there is also a Central\h
Military Commission under the government,\h\h

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
also headed by Xi Jinping. But the Party\h
version is the actual one in charge.\h

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,440
So with the Party’s Central Military\h
Commission in charge of making defense policy,\h\h

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,200
this new law strengthens\h
the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,520
and helps Xi Jinping consolidate\h
more power over the military.\h

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,880
Although Xi has been purging the military\h
to consolidate his power for years.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Now is a good time to remind everyone\h
that the Chinese military, the\h\h

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
People’s Liberation Army, belongs\h
to the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,160
This is not the Chinese government’s\h
military. It’s the Communist Party’s military.

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,240
And with this latest change\h
to the law, the government has\h\h

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,880
less control over the PLA than it previously had.\h\h

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,560
Although in some ways, this law isn’t giving\h
the Chinese Communist Party new powers.\h\h

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,080
It’s just reaffirming the powers that the Party\h
has already taken. I’ll explain a bit later.\h

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,160
But don’t worry, the Communist Party\h
is here to safeguard world peace.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,440
And I’ll show you what that means after the break.

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Welcome back. The Chinese Communist Party\h
is here to safeguard world peace...using\h\h

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,480
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with\h
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\h\h

49
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
as the guiding thought over China’s\h
national defense activities!

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,280
If this national defense law change is giving you\h
some General Hostility vibes, you’re not alone.

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,960
That’s my favorite soap opera about the Party’s\h
factional infighting. And it’s getting pretty\h\h

52
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,320
intense. I can’t wait for the next episode.\h
You never know who’s going to get purged next!

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,560
Ok, sometimes you know who’s\h
going to get purged next.

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,320
Anyway, back to the national defense law.\h
I don’t want to give you the impression\h\h

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
that the new law is just about\h
giving Xi Jinping new war powers.\h

56
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,480
It’s also about protecting China’s development\h
interests, according to the Global Times.

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,640
Specifically, the law states that China should\h
mobilize its defense “when China's sovereignty,\h\h

58
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,520
unification, territorial integrity, security\h
and development interests are threatened.”

59
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,640
“Development interests” is a new addition there.\h
So what are China’s development interests exactly?

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
According to the Global Times,\h
development interests could involve\h\h

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
economic interests, like overseas investments.

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Hmmm, sounds like US tariffs could be considered\h
a threat to China’s development interests.\h

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,400
And development interests definitely\h
involve Taiwan. Because if “the Taiwan\h\h

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,280
question remains unresolved,” that will\h
impair China’s development interests.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah there’s only one way that the Chinese\h
Communist Party is planning to “resolve”\h\h

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,160
the Taiwan question. It’s family reunion\h
time! Starting with a trip to the beach.\h

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,560
But on the whole, development\h
interests seem to be anything\h\h

68
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,560
that involves China’s development as defined\h
by the Chinese Communist Party. It’s meant\h\h

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,680
to be really broad. Basically it could\h
cover anything that’s not already covered\h\h

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,320
by China’s sovereignty, unification,\h
territorial integrity, and security.

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,920
For example, China’s Belt and Road\h
Initiative investments in other countries\h\h

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,080
could be considered development interests.

73
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,360
So is the national defense law saying\h
that the People’s Liberation Army could\h\h

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,280
be mobilized in other countries to\h
defend the Belt and Road? Yes, it is.

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
In fact, “China has been completely forthright\h\h

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,320
in developing an explicit military\h
agenda to support the Belt and Road.”

77
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,280
Including “pursuing a strong naval force as the\h
logical corollary to its ‘development interests.’”

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,160
Is anyone in the Pentagon paying attention\h
to this? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?

79
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,560
You know what else is part of\h
China’s development interests?\h\h

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,520
Its military-civil fusion program. That’s\h
where Chinese companies and universities are\h\h

81
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,880
encouraged to develop technology that\h
has both civilian and military uses.\h\h

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,760
And that’s something that’s emphasized\h
in this new national defense law, too.

83
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Specifically, state owned and private\h
enterprises need to research conventional\h\h

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,560
weapons, plus weapons related to cyber\h
warfare, space and electromagnetics.”

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
So the Chinese Communist Party is doubling\h
down on their military-civil fusion.\h\h

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
And it’s looking to get even more Chinese\h
companies involved. That includes both state-owned\h\h

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,800
enterprises and private companies. Which, of\h
course, makes those companies not totally private.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,320
This is happening just as the Trump\h
administration has issued executive\h\h

89
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,960
orders to prevent US investors\h
from investing in these companies.\h

90
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,520
But at this rate, all Chinese companies\h
are going to be military-linked companies.

91
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,240
And the Trump administration’s actions are\h
a threat to China’s development interests.

92
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,440
Speaking of military-civil fusion,\h
the new national defense law also\h\h

93
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,400
says that everyone should get involved in\h
national defense, not just the military.\h

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,080
“The revised law makes it clear that\h
all state organs and armed forces,\h\h

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,880
political parties and people’s groups,\h
enterprises and public institutions,\h\h

96
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,640
social organizations and\h
organizations of other types\h\h

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,960
should support national defense and\h
participate in its development.”

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,120
And just like the definition of China’s\h
“development interests” is really broad,\h\h

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,600
so is the definition of national defense. Could\h
“enterprises and public institutions” be ordered\h\h

100
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,040
to steal research from foreign companies and\h
universities to support China’s national defense?\h

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,760
Sounds familiar, right? And that’s because\h
overall, the new national defense law\h\h

102
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,800
provides a legal framework for what the\h
Chinese Communist Party was already doing.\h

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,960
Xi Jinping’s Central Military\h
Commission wouldn’t be getting\h\h

104
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,640
these new war powers if Xi hadn’t\h
already taken over the military.

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
And from militarizing the Belt\h
and Road, to threatening Taiwan,\h\h

106
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,960
to developing military-civil fusion,\h
these things were already happening.\h\h

107
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,440
But now they are officially justified and\h
spelled out in this national defense law.\h\h

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Which means the Communist Party is probably going\h
to accelerate everything they’re already doing.

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
Except for that weight watchers program.

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
But don’t worry, it’s all\h
for safeguarding world peace.

111
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,400
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

112
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,320
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.\h\h

113
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,800
If you join the China Uncensored 50-Cent\h
Army on the crowdfunding website Patreon,\h\h

114
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,840
you can ask me questions on the show, too. Check\h
out patreon.com/chinauncensored to learn more.

115
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,600
Andrew Whittaker asks:\h

116
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,960
When will you guys do an episode on the origins\h
on the CCP virus? There seems to be more meat\h\h

117
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,320
on those bones now. in particular there is\h
plenty of circumstantial evidence around now\h\h

118
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,280
to say that it did accidentally leak out\h
of a certain lab in a certain location!\h\h

119
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,320
Even the Washington post is\h
starting to write about it!

120
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah, Andrew, I’ve also noticed that this is\h
suddenly being talked about now in the media.\h\h

121
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,400
When before even mentioning the\h
possibility of the coronavirus\h\h

122
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,400
coming from a lab leak was considered taboo. You\h
would absolutely be called a conspiracy theorist.\h

123
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
But now even New York Magazine has\h
done a cover story on the idea.

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,880
Well, would you guys like us to do an episode\h
on the evidence that the CCP virus could have\h\h

125
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
come from a lab leak? Let us know in\h
the comments below. That episode is\h\h

126
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,960
definitely getting demonetized. Which is\h
why your support on Patreon is so important.

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
Thank you for your question, Andrew. And thank\h
you for watching this episode of China Uncensored.\h\h
