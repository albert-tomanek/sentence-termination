1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,370
Taiwan’s Election Results Are In

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,230
And the real loser is the Chinese Communist
Party

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,710
Find out how Hong Kong protests

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,260
Played a big role in the elections

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,760
I’m Chris Chappell, coming to you from Taipei,
Taiwan.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,390
Taiwan’s historic 2020 presidential and
legislative elections

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,990
happened over the weekend.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,090
And like pretty much everything in Taiwan...

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,190
The elections were adorable.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,190
See?

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,190
Adorable.

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,190
Adorable.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,190
Adorable.

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,670
Adora--no wait, that’s horrifying.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,000
Ok, not everything was adorable.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,730
The election was targeted with a disinformation
campaign

18
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,640
from the Chinese Communist Party.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,090
And people were feeling it.

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,239
The biggest catchphrase of the election, “dried
mango strips”

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,399
refers to a feeling of impending national
doom.

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,149
But even with the impending doom, the Tsai
campaign

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,570
still found time to release an anime adventure
game called

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,570
“What?!

25
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,640
I, a Taiwanese third-year high schooler from
Class 2,

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,519
suddenly fell into a different world and met
the president?!”

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,780
Why don’t *American* presidential candidates
release

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,470
anime adventure games?

29
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,220
But back to the non-anime Taiwan election.

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,270
In which current president Tsai Ing-wen won
in a landslide

31
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,310
against her opponent Han Kuo-yu.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,470
In fact, Tsai got more votes than any presidential
candidate

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,330
in the history of Taiwan’s democracy.

34
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,159
And Tsai’s party, the Democratic Progessive
Party,

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,330
also won a majority of seats in the Legislative
Yuan.

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,530
The election was a major defeat for Han’s
party, the KMT.

37
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,619
One of the biggest differences between the
two parties

38
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,950
is how they treat China.

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,509
The DPP has been a strong supporter of Taiwan
sovereignty,

40
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,659
and resisting pressure from Beijing.

41
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,230
The KMT has pushed for stronger ties with
China,

42
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,290
with the goal of boosting Taiwan’s economy.

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,290
As the votes were counted,

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,159
it became clear pretty early on that this
election

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,750
was going to the DPP and Tsai Ing-wen.

46
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,940
That created a wave of euphoria at the DPP
rally.

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,829
And...not so much as the KMT rally.

48
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,840
We watched the ballot counting in Taipei’s
district four,

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,459
traditionally a KMT area.

50
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:10,599
In the last election,

51
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,909
the DPP didn’t even bother to run a legislative
candidate.

52
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,930
This time, the majority here voted DPP.

53
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,689
A year ago, few people would have predicted
this.

54
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,669
The KMT had had a surge in popularity,

55
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,189
especially as economic issues became a focus
in Taiwanese politics.

56
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,709
In the 2018 regional elections, the DPP lost
big to the KMT,

57
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,189
and Tsai Ing-wen was forced to step down as
the DPP chair.

58
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,519
At one point, it looked like she might not
even be

59
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,060
the DDP candidate for the 2020 elections.

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,349
So how did this happen?

61
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,719
Well, there were a lot of factors.

62
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,719
Including the fact that

63
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,439
people either really loved or really hated
Han Kuo-yu.

64
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,489
And then this happened.

65
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,779
For months, Hong Kong has been embroiled

66
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,480
in protests against the Chinese Communist
Party.

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,500
The Communist Party, and how Taiwan should
deal with China,

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,239
is always a big focus in Taiwanese elections.

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,889
But the Hong Kong protests gave Taiwanese
voters a clear picture

70
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,459
of what they did not want to happen here.

71
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,389
“Have the Kong Kong protests affected how
you might vote today?”

72
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:22,249
“Yes, it made me think, ‘I have to vote
today.’”

73
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,370
“Why?”

74
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,849
“Because we don’t want to be (the) next
Hong Kong.”

75
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,919
“We don’t want to be the next Hong Kong.”

76
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,180
The Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan
a Chinese province

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,400
and has vowed to get Taiwan back under its
control.

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,449
If they can’t do it economically,

79
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,799
then they’ll do it with the military.

80
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,359
And while Han Kuo-Yu called for closer economic
ties with China,

81
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,589
promising that it would help average Taiwanese
people get rich...

82
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,689
Tsai Ing-wen made Taiwanese sovereignty and
comparisons

83
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,819
with Hong Kong a central piece to her campaign
strategy.

84
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,669
And Hong Kong protesters even went to DPP
rallies

85
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,379
to witness Taiwan’s election.

86
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,719
“We are from Hong Kong and we are coming
to Taiwan

87
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,049
to support the freedom and democracy in Taiwan.”

88
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,239
And while KMT supporters showed plenty of
enthusiasm at their rally,

89
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,450
there were no Hong Kong protesters in sight.

90
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,910
It’s not hard to guess which presidential
candidate

91
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,669
was Beijing’s favorite.

92
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,270
So people were very worried that the Chinese
Communist Party

93
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,060
would try to interfere with the election.

94
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,870
Tsai Ing-wen actively made it an issue during
the campaign.

95
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,020
Han Kuo-Yu...not so much.

96
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,140
Mayor Han, do you still think CCP

97
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,560
didn't interfere with Taiwan Election?

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
You made my right ear deaf,

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
let me switch to my left ear now.

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
Which media are you from?

101
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
You tell me that first.

102
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm from NTD.

103
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,740
I see!

104
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,100
Any other questions?

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,460
But the landslide victory for Tsai and the
DPP

106
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,729
shows just how concerned the Taiwanese people
are about China.

107
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,340
The Chinese Communist Party, obviously,

108
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,240
was not too pleased about the election results.

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,370
In fact, the official Xinhua state-run news
agency

110
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,330
blamed foreign forces,

111
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,560
including the US, for Tsai’s win in the...

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,060
Taiwan regional leadership election.

113
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,530
So glad we could be here for the Taiwan regional
leadership election.

114
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,430
But what happens next is the real question.

115
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,460
The Chinese Communist Party tried

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,580
to use money and intimidation in Hong Kong,

117
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,300
and that failed in the recent Hong Kong local
elections.

118
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,319
The Communist Party tried to use money and
intimidation in Taiwan

119
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,650
and that failed, too.

120
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,190
Will China resort to more brutal tactics in
Hong Kong and Taiwan?

121
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,699
How will the United States respond?

122
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,849
One thing is clear—

123
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,860
supporting the CCP is no longer

124
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,830
a good choice for your political career.

125
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,189
The chairman of the KMT was forced to resign

126
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,560
after the humiliating defeat.

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,860
And while Han Kuo-Yu will now carry on as

128
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,030
the mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung,

129
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,360
he’s likely to face a recall election.

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,110
And I just have to say personally,

131
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,159
I was moved seeing these elections

132
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,710
and how passionate the Taiwanese people are
about democracy.

133
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,009
I hope that’s a spirit we can all bring

134
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,439
to the 2020 US presidential elections.

135
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,300
Well, that and an anime adventure game called

136
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
“What?!

137
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,600
I, an American third-year high schooler from
Class 2,

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,150
suddenly fell into a different world and met
the president?!”

139
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,159
Thanks for watching.

140
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,080
And once again a big thank you to the fans

141
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,819
who support China Uncensored on the crowd
funding website Patreon.

142
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,650
We wouldn’t be able to come to Taiwan to
cover these elections

143
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,810
if it weren’t for their support,

144
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,580
please leave a thank you to them in the comments
below.

145
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,979
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,780
see you next time.
