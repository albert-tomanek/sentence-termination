00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,050
I am full of prejudice against China.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,310
And arrogance.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,220
You know, when I went to public relations
training for...um

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,970
no US government agency in particular...

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,820
they taught me how to respond to tough questions
from nosy reporters:

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,210
You turn the tables.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,839
Knock them off balance.

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,509
Beat them at their own game.

11
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,050
And it seems China’s Foreign Minister Wang
Yi

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,329
has had similar training from the Chinese
counterpart to the...

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,960
no US government agency in particular.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,469
Earlier this month, Wang and Canada’s Foreign
Affairs Minister

15
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,859
held a peaceful joint press conference in
Ottawa.

16
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:50,600
When suddenly, this so-called Canadian reporter,
Amanda Connolly,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,579
tried to undermine China by asking a question
about so-called “human rights.”

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,899
And this was Wang’s response:

19
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,829
“I have to say that your question is full
of prejudice against China and arrogance.

20
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,709
I don't know where that comes from.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,260
Now: Release the five-pointed question attack!

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,189
“Have you ever been to China?

23
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,689
Do you know that China has lifted more than
600 million people out of poverty?

24
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,600
And do you know that China is now the second
largest economy in the world,

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,369
coming from a very low foundation?

26
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:24,280
Do you think development is possible for China
without protection for human rights?

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,970
And did you know that China has written protection
and promotion of human rights into our constitution?

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,210
Answered the question with more questions.

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,729
And you know what?

30
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,240
Wang’s questions make a really good point.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,399
China has the second largest economy in the
world.

32
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,090
And nothing says “human rights” like the
right to make money.

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,360
As state-run media tells us every year.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,979
“The Chinese government released its annual
white paper on human rights on Monday morning,

35
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,350
highlighting progress made in 2014

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,369
The 14,000 word Human Rights Report looked
at the improvements in people's livelihood,

37
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,780
including higher incomes.”

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,750
See? China has created its own, more favorable
definition of “human rights.”

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,780
Hmm... where have I seen this kind of thing
before?

40
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,060
War is peace!

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Freedom is slavery!

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,740
Ignorance is strength!

43
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,510
I mean, sure, the so-called “Freedom House”
organization

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,080
gave China a freedom ranking of 16...

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,610
out of 100.

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,540
But they’re full of prejudice against China.

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,010
And arrogance.

48
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,500
And I doubt they’ve ever been to China.

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,580
And let me remind you,

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,840
as Wang Yi did,

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,910
that China has protection and promotion of
human rights written into its constitution.

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,410
For example

53
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,380
—and these are all real—

54
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,470
China’s constitution guarantees:

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,730
The right to vote

56
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,030
Freedom of speech

57
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,410
Freedom of religion

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,860
Freedom of the press

59
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,480
and Freedom of assembly

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,600
Wait, what are those asterisks?

61
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,060
I see.

62
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,130
But look: If you didn’t like Wang Yi’s
response to that reporter’s question,

63
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,070
don’t blame him!

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,060
“Blame Canada! Blame Canada!”

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,040
That’s right. Blame Canada’s Foreign Affairs
Minister Stéphane Dion.

66
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,900
Because the reporter had actually addressed
her question at him.

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,920
"Stéphane Dion just stood quietly by as this
went on."

68
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,070
That’s right. As you can see in this footage
the reporter shot,

69
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,760
Dion didn’t interrupt,

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,540
and didn’t call Wang out afterwards.

71
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,160
And really, isn’t that a problem, too?

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,890
Chinese authorities pull a bunch of jerk moves,

73
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,330
and foreign governments stand by like some
polite Mountie.

74
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,130
If China is going to change the definition
of human rights

75
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,890
in order to make the world think it gives
people freedom

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,840
then really, shouldn’t we call them on it?

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,160
So if you were Canada’s Foreign Affairs
Minister,

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,410
what would you have said to Wang Yi?
