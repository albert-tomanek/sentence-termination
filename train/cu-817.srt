1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,680
China is invading the US!

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,860
Without firing a single shot.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,340
A retired US General tells us how.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,160
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,630
Iâ€™m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,490
Tensions between the United States and China

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,570
are at an all time high.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,269
In Washington, the dialogue around China has
changed.

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,789
The US relationship with China

10
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,470
is now being called strategic competition.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,539
To get a better idea of what that means,

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,500
I sat down with recently retired Air Force
General

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,480
Robert Spalding in Washington DC.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,940
He was the senior director for strategic planning

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,579
on the National Security Council

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,720
and advised the Trump administration on China.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,600
Thank you for joining me, General.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,789
Great to be here.

19
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,000
Glad to hear it.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,050
So you advised the White House

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,329
and helped draft the national security strategy.

22
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,950
And it mentions China more than any other
country.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,950
Why is that?

24
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,160
So, I mean, I have to take you all the way
back six years,

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,570
if you're really interested-

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,570
Okay-

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,869
Because I've been working on this issue

28
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,660
for really the last six years.

29
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,549
It started in the summer of 2013 when we went
to

30
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,960
the council of foreign relations as a military
fellow.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,390
And that was my first introduction to, kind
of,

32
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,240
the global business world.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,830
Met a lot of people in finance and business,

34
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,939
and at the time, the Air Force was looking
at

35
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,680
to send me to China at some point,

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,049
and I knew that.

37
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,729
And I wanted to get as smart as I could about

38
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,730
how China interacted with the global community
through business.

39
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,799
And so, I started asking questions.

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,399
And my going in assumption at the time was,

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,040
that I think this is indicative of all Americans,

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,719
is a sense of hubris.

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,969
A sense that our model,

44
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:57,990
our economic model,

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,310
our social model, is-

46
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,310
Number one?

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,310
Is number one.

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,520
It's without reproach.

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,720
And that while China was growing at the time,

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,780
it's growth model had come to an end.

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,160
It was gonna stagnate.

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,330
And then we were gonna essentially flip the
gross switch back and,

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,910
and then we were gonna essentially climb away
from it-

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,470
And China would become a democracy-

55
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,770
And China ... Well, no.

56
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,460
China would become

57
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,180
a poorer totalitarian country,

58
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,380
which would at some point lead them to believe
that,

59
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,460
"Hey, we need to open up and become a democracy.

60
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,580
And so we can grow again like the United States."

61
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,270
About this time, I met one gentleman who's
a businessman

62
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,470
who had had a lot of money invested in China.

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,240
And essentially lost a good portion of it
during

64
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,180
the financial crisis during 2008.

65
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
Of course,

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,210
we've grown that back up.

67
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,080
And then about 2012, 2013,

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,670
he had exited China as a market

69
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,640
because he had realized that China was changing

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,030
in ways that he couldn't predict

71
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,190
where that investment might go in the future.

72
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,750
And so our discussion, when I first met him,

73
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,570
was over a lunch at one of the private clubs
in New York.

74
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,030
And we essentially got into an argument.

75
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,330
I said, "Hey, they're gonna stagnate.

76
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,180
They're not going anywhere."

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
And he said, "Oh, no.

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
They're not gonna stagnate,

79
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
they're gonna grow.

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,180
And they're gonna grow and their gonna become

81
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,920
the most powerful country in the world."

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,150
And I said, "That can't be."

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,690
America's democratic society and free market
system

84
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,830
is much better than, kind of, the state led
model.

85
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,840
And he says, "You don't know what you're talking
about."

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
And I mean, the truth is,

87
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,280
I'd spend 20 something years in the military

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,500
focusing on how to go to war with countries,

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,920
not how to go to business with them.

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,910
And so, looking back, it was evident that

91
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,950
I didn't know what I was talking about and
he did.

92
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,790
And so, that lead to a relationship where
we,

93
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,470
over the next year, corresponded.

94
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,640
I eventually moved over to the joint staff

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
to be the advisor on China to the Chairman
of Joint Chiefs.

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,880
And he would periodically send me data about
China's economy,

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,590
doing business in China, what was going on.

98
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,600
It was the fall of '14 he sent a briefing
to me.

99
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,120
And it sat in my inbox for about a week.

100
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,430
And I opened the email up one day and

101
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,260
when I had a minute of peace in the Pentagon.

102
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,120
And I started reading the briefing.

103
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,760
And literally my mind broke because I realized

104
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,380
that I did not know.

105
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,160
Here I was, I had a PHD in economics,

106
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,290
a decorated military officer,

107
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,430
and I did not know how the international world
worked.

108
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,050
And I suspected, because of that, because
of my background,

109
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,840
that most people didn't know as well.

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,710
And so, this started an intense effort to
really dig down deep

111
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:10,480
into how everything from finance trade, investment,
immigration,

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,990
the internet, media, politics, all of that,
how it all works,

113
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,500
and how it serves.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,770
And what I found is how it has served the
Chinese communist party-

115
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,200
Oh, I'm curious what was-

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Strategy.

117
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
In this briefing that blew your mind.

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah, so, again, you have to go back to my
background.

119
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,110
I'm a B2 pilot.

120
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,770
Primarily we train to take societies apart,
right?

121
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,110
If the US wants to impose its will, it has
a political ...

122
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,870
It essentially, as Clausewitz says,

123
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,730
"War is politics by other means."

124
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,610
One good example was the war in Kosovo.

125
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,050
We sought to stop Milosevic.

126
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,270
Again, the way that you create that political
pressure

127
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,450
to stop Milosevic is you eventually strangle
his ability

128
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,170
to control the country.

129
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,610
And then they capitulate.

130
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,870
So I had studied how to do this from the air
with weapons.

131
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,200
What I saw in that briefing,

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,230
and because I had a doctorate in economics,

133
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,760
could understand and fathom was that here
was a model

134
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,210
for doing the exact same thing with economics.

135
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,210
And I said-

136
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,520
So business becomes China's B2 bomber?

137
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Exactly.

138
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,280
And it was actually kind of like the B2,

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,870
which is a stealth aircraft.

140
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,340
It was a stealthy operation primarily because
our own laws.

141
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,641
Companies can't talk about, and often are
unwilling to talk about,

142
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,900
what happens to them.

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
Either because it affects their evaluation

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,950
or because the general council and their company
says,

145
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,360
"You can't share that."

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,280
Or, there's a general uneasiness about talking
to government.

147
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,800
And so, in that briefing,

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,669
I saw vignette, after vignette,

149
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,330
about how specifically elements in China

150
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,610
had gone after companies to put them under
pressure, under duress,

151
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,700
in order to acquire some specific piece of
technology,

152
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,380
or intellectual property.

153
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,780
And it was going on across the country.

154
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,330
And I said, "Okay, if this happening,

155
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,450
what else is happening?

156
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,520
What else do I not know?"

157
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,660
And that, like I said, that started this entire
effort.

158
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,580
That lead, ultimately ...

159
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,800
I finished my tour in joint staff.

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,290
I went to be the in Beijing,

161
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,940
and eventually to work on the national security
council where,

162
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,750
by that time, I had a good,

163
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,470
fulsome picture of everything that was going
on.

164
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,580
And it really requires you to kind of look
at

165
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,270
the incentive structure of the system.

166
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,250
The thing that America has patented and why
we've so successful,

167
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,150
our democratic model aligned with the liberal
capitalist system,

168
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,880
is we aligned private profit motive with national
interest.

169
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,020
In other words, if you're doing well, the
country is doing well.

170
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,560
What I found was China had done the same thing

171
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,740
except align your private profit motive

172
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,330
wherever you were with their national interest.

173
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,040
And so, if you were doing well, China was
doing well.

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,919
And it was actually quite brilliant.

175
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,090
And so basically,

176
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,800
all I had to do at the national security council

177
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,550
was help educate people on what was going
on.

178
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:44,110
Just like I had spent the last four years
teaching myself

179
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,140
about what was going on.

180
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,670
Then it was just time to essentially

181
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,600
share that with my colleagues.

182
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,770
And once you start to understand how the world
works

183
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,760
along all of these different areas of globalization

184
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,540
then you understand that the system's actually
setup

185
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,520
that a totalitarian regime can actually do
quite well.

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,230
And actually, not just do well from an economic
perspective,

187
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,100
but also do well in terms of transferring
their values

188
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
into democratic societies.

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,260
And so the "So what" of what I found was not
that ...

190
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,510
In the defense department,

191
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,680
we essentially prepare for war.

192
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,150
That's what we do.

193
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,230
And then we go to war if the-

194
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,240
If it comes to that.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,490
If it comes to that.

196
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,400
What I found was

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,190
the Chinese way of doing things didn't require
war,

198
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,330
it just required you to stay open for business.

199
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,070
And then slowly, it would allow the suppression
of freedoms

200
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,770
that we currently take, quite frankly, for
granted.

201
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,850
And so, it's not just,

202
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,400
"Hey, it's gonna improve their economy."

203
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,810
"Hey, it's gonna actually undermine your democracy
over time-"

204
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,970
Yeah, I believe they use the term

205
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,149
"unrestricted warfare" to describe this.

206
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,540
Well that was ... I read that when it came
out in 1999.

207
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,250
I thought, "Well this is preposterous."

208
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,300
First of all, we're never gonna go to war
with China.

209
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
We're never gonna have armed conflict.

210
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,080
We're two nuclear armed countries.

211
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,840
Nobody in their right mind wants to go to
war

212
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,020
with a nuclear armed country just because
of all

213
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,450
the potential for risk and devastation.

214
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,880
And so, I discounted it.

215
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,610
And it's because, quite frankly,

216
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,190
the guys that wrote that were actually quite...

217
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,750
They could see into the future,

218
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:43,040
and see what openness would mean in terms
of an opportunity

219
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,470
for China to essentially get gains out of
democracies expenses

220
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,630
without creating any kind of risk whatsoever.

221
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,320
I think one really clear example you gave
me

222
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,920
was the example of the artificial islands

223
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,520
China's building in the South China Sea.

224
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,740
Why don't you tell us a bit about that

225
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,060
and how that plays into the global market.

226
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Right.

227
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,800
So, if you think about today how global finance
work,

228
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,920
a lot of it is done by index investing.

229
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,950
In other words,

230
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,290
an index tracks a certain set of companies

231
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,520
and institutional investors.

232
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,290
Retirement funds basically invest in those
companies

233
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,120
based on what the index calls for.

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,529
So, in recently the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index

235
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,240
increased its weighting from 5% to 20%

236
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
and that results in a significant amount of
money

237
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,590
going to China in the next year.

238
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,029
So, over the next year, almost a trillion
US dollars

239
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,390
will go into China's stock market.

240
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,750
That's money that's coming right out of our
retirement funds.

241
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,470
Some of these companies do things

242
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,040
like build islands in the South China Sea,

243
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,660
or build aircraft carriers, or help the oppression

244
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,470
currently going on in Xinjiang.

245
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,380
So, in essence, you have our retirement funds

246
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,100
are being invested in things that, quite frankly,

247
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,360
we call out from a national perspective.

248
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,460
In other words, the department of defense
is sending navy ships

249
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,790
within 12 nautical miles of illegal islands
in the South China Sea

250
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,390
while our public employees are investing in
those islands.

251
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,790
That's insane.

252
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,529
So what would you say is the single biggest
threat

253
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,580
to the US from China?

254
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:46,170
Well, I mean, when you say that in that way,

255
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,110
it implies that you can isolate it.

256
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,110
Right?

257
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,980
It's so pervasive that you can't isolate it.

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,220
And it's integrated as well.

259
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,490
So, I think the single greatest threat

260
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,250
is just their desire to maintain control,

261
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,110
which requires that they essentially suppress
speech,

262
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,730
suppress freedom of religion,

263
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,360
and really use oppression as a tool of government.

264
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,060
All three of those things, essentially,

265
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,780
were called out by FDR in his state of the
union address in 1941.

266
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,580
And essentially those four freedoms became

267
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,510
the basis of our international order.

268
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,510
In other words,

269
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,510
if you look at the Atlantic Charter,

270
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,260
if you look at the UN Charter,

271
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
there's two kind of fundamental pieces to
that.

272
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,899
One is free markets and the other is democratic
principals.

273
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,750
And those were the things that specifically
are called out,

274
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,890
in document number nine,

275
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:51,080
as being not designed for the purpose of promoting

276
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,060
what we believe to be, kind of, universal
norms,

277
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,170
but specifically designed to

278
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,250
take down the Chinese communist party.

279
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,070
So, when you put unrestricted warfare together

280
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,820
with document number nine,

281
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,380
essentially what you have is a theory of victory

282
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,350
and a motive for that struggle, if you will.

283
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,590
So it's their desire to maintain control,
right?

284
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,680
That really becomes a threat to our freedoms.

285
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,900
So you see, sort of,

286
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,330
the current western world order that has these
principals.

287
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,820
That is incompatible with a China lead global
order?

288
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,140
Absolutely.

289
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,510
Because essentially what they've done is

290
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,800
they've taken the same four freedoms and their
social contract

291
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,709
is built around the idea that number one,

292
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,361
the Chinese communist party is the only one

293
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,650
that can return China to its rightful place
in the world.

294
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,200
Number two, in order for us to do that,

295
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,960
we have a social contract with the Chinese
people.

296
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,390
And that social contract is

297
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,310
we will essentially deliver continuous economic
growth

298
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,330
as long as you don't challenge our right to
rule.

299
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,140
And so basically, the way that looks,

300
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,890
if you take FDR's speech,

301
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,950
it says we'll put freedom from want up at
the top

302
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,529
and then you basically forfeit all the other
three freedoms.

303
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:18,839
And that's a social contract.

304
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,870
So as long as we keep growing economically,

305
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,950
you have no right to challenge our rule.

306
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,560
Well so I guess the fundamental problem

307
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,520
in the United States is that people,

308
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,811
they can look at China and see that the Chinese
communist party

309
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,400
has the largest standing army in the world.

310
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,040
And they know that China is hacking the United
States.

311
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,580
But it seems like there's a lot of specific
strategies

312
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,490
the communist part is using that the American
public

313
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,779
might not be too aware of.

314
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,380
What are some of those strategies?

315
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,670
Well, I already talked about

316
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,399
how they use global finance, basically.

317
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,260
So they're 30 trillion dollars in debt right
now.

318
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,860
They have a non convertible currency in strict
capital controls.

319
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,899
Money, especially from elites, is trying to
flee the country.

320
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,779
They're clamping that down and they're using

321
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,940
the flow of capital from the west

322
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,260
to kind of show up their financial markets.

323
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,150
In trade, you have essentially,

324
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,120
and this is also within the country,

325
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,540
you have a very low regulation.

326
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,019
In other words,

327
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,640
if you look at trade from their standpoint,

328
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
we have four inspectors.

329
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,670
The United States has four inspectors in China.

330
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,830
I believe two in Shanghai and two in Shenzhen.

331
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,649
These inspectors are not allowed to look inside
any containers.

332
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,279
They get manifest, they may call out,

333
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,290
"Hey, we think there's a problem here with
this container."

334
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,380
Of course, then the Chinese go

335
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,890
and do the inspections on behalf of them.

336
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:51,180
Then, you have to deal with the fact that
by Chinese law,

337
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,420
there's no timeline required in terms of

338
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,180
when you declare that container exported.

339
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,600
So it can be already on the ship and gone.

340
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,510
Also, a majority of the lading is done during
the weekends.

341
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,130
And if you're a Chinese customs officer,

342
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,399
you're penalized if you slow down the lading
process.

343
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:12,839
So in essence you have an export system that
is completely ...

344
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,679
It sends everything that gets produced.

345
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,220
Which is why you have issues like fentanyl
investment.

346
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,189
The Chinese use finance to come and look at
...

347
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,929
Even companies that our defense department

348
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,750
is investing in to develop technologies.

349
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,580
They wait 'til those can't find investment

350
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
here in the United States

351
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,710
because it's a tough business keeping a business
going.

352
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,029
If you're trying to prove out a new technology,

353
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,679
they'll swoop in, they'll take the business,

354
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,710
they'll take it back to China.

355
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,399
They'll commercialize it and then they got
the technology

356
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:54,759
for both their military and they export it

357
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,159
back to the United States.

358
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,909
Intellectual property theft.

359
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:02,159
They're able to, because of our laws,

360
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,039
one company can steal a technology.

361
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,590
It can transfer that technology to another
company in China.

362
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,940
That company can produce the goods,

363
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,019
export it to the United States.

364
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,090
So now they're making money,

365
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,679
but because of discovery laws in our own legal
system,

366
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,759
the company that was originally ripped off
has no recourse.

367
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,830
And so, along all areas of our connectivity,

368
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,970
they have an ability to, essentially,

369
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,409
they've re engineered globalization to their
advantage.

370
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,049
So they're using our laws to undermine us?

371
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,559
Our laws, our markets, our financial system,

372
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,899
our media, our internet.

373
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:44,899
You name it.

374
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,350
Well, so what is the US doing about this?

375
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,679
Well I think for the first time

376
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,419
we're actually beginning the process to understand
it.

377
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,639
And then of course because we haven't applied
policy

378
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,460
in a kind of a 21st century competitive format,

379
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,169
we're trying to learn how to do that.

380
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,250
And so, the first step was a national security
strategy.

381
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,269
Just identifying the problem, right?

382
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,519
'Cause the federal bureaucracy's a huge organization.

383
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,090
It's probably the hugest in the world.

384
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,489
And so, you have to identify the problem.

385
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,730
But then once you identify the problem,

386
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,830
that message has to be inculcated in the very
large bureaucracy.

387
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,480
And then after that, the bureaucracy has to
figure out

388
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,889
what does it do about it?

389
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:33,889
Right?

390
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,109
It's not sufficient just to understand it.

391
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,409
Now you have to figure out,

392
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,389
"Okay, based on our laws,

393
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:42,600
based on how globalization works,

394
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,649
how do we fix things?"

395
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:45,649
Okay.

396
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:46,649
So in your mind,

397
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,900
what would be the ideal US, China policy?

398
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,200
I like the term "Decoupling".

399
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,029
I think being coupled to China in such a fulsome
way

400
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,609
is actually damaging to our democracy.

401
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:03,899
And so, there's a lot of people that say,

402
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:09,369
"Hey, we should have no say in the relationship

403
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,530
between the Chinese communist party and the
Chinese people."

404
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,320
And in some respects, I agree with that.

405
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,210
That is up to the Chinese people.

406
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,249
But I would say the relationship of the Chinese
communist party

407
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:24,190
with the United States is what I would focus
on.

408
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,679
And the less relationship we have, the better,
I think.

409
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,620
In terms of our future freedoms.

410
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,919
How would that be achieved, though?

411
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,390
'Cause I mean our economies are so linked.

412
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,600
It's hard to decouple that.

413
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,580
Well, if you go back to before the WTO,

414
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,620
very single year,

415
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,369
we had a vote in the congress on whether to
extend

416
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,190
those favored nation status to the Chinese.

417
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,049
Prior to that, no major American corporation

418
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,940
would invest in any significant way in China,
right?

419
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,179
Because large companies need to have stability
in their operations.

420
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,529
And so, I think the more we understand about
the problem

421
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,789
and the more that creates a need within the
American people to say,

422
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,869
"Hey, let's rethink the relationship

423
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,259
and let's actually see how it affects us.

424
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,960
Is it in a positive way or is it in a negative
way?"

425
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,669
As those questions begin to be asked,

426
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,109
corporations are gonna have to take a step
back and say,

427
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,109
"Does it make a lot of sense for me to have

428
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,989
significant operations in China

429
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:30,350
when they can be impacted by the relationship
going forward?"

430
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,229
So, I think in essence,

431
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,169
those things are already beginning to happen.

432
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,869
You're beginning to see corporations rethink

433
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:40,580
how they structure their operations abroad.

434
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,359
Particularly if they have significant operations
in China.

435
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,139
What they're hoping, and I think wrongly so,

436
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,679
is that these trade negotiations

437
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,059
make everything go back to normal.

438
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,710
Once people begin to wake up to what's going
on,

439
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,179
I think you're gonna see more and more cause,

440
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,220
particularly in congress,

441
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,520
that we actually strictly look at the relationship

442
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,200
for what it is and how it benefits,

443
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,820
or doesn't,

444
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,059
the American people,

445
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,680
and then do the right thing.

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,700
One final question.

447
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,200
Do you think China is the next superpower?

448
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,820
No.

449
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,539
Quite frankly, I think that we're gonna

450
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,000
look back at history and we're gonna say,

451
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,160
"After 2008, the Chinese communist party

452
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,809
viewed itself as ascendent."

453
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:38,750
And I think viewed strategy as ascendent.

454
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,479
And I think that caused them to do some things

455
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:46,350
that actually they moved away from hide and
bide.

456
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,870
And I think in doing so,

457
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,650
exposed the communist party for what it is.

458
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,000
And therefore allowed people

459
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,270
to kind of wake from their slumber

460
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,200
and understand what's going on.

461
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,610
I think you can't put that back in the box.

462
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,489
It's out for everybody to see,

463
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,320
and now it's just a matter of,

464
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,909
"Will democracies do the right thing,

465
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:12,330
or they allow themselves to be essentially
bought into

466
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,220
co-opting their freedoms for profit?"

467
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,679
Well that was very enlightening.

468
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,360
Thank you for joining us today, General.

469
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,060
Absolutely.

470
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,480
Thank you again, General.

471
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,700
There's actually much, much more to learn.

472
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,840
Fortunately we sat down together

473
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
on the China Unscripted Podcast

474
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,609
and it's frankly pretty horrifying.

475
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,180
So, click the link and check it out.
