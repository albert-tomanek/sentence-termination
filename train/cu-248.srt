00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,610
kids do the darndest things.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,059
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:11,599
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,259
Check this out.

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,629
It was posted a couple weeks ago

7
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,769
on Chinese social media.

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,449
This three-year-old kid picks up a steel pipe,

9
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,929
like he’s gonna fight off a bunch of police
officers.

10
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,169
What a riot!

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,279
Even the police officers are filming it.

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,499
The video is so cute that China’s state-run
People’s Daily

13
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,439
posted it to their YouTube channel.

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,230
Wait…

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,620
the People’s Daily has a YouTube channel?

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,699
YouTube is blocked in China.

17
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,610
But I guess there’s no harm in showing the
rest of the world

18
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,390
how cute Chinese toddlers can be, right?

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,060
Haha, look at that!

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,440
Wait…

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,750
it sounds like he’s screaming,

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,340
“Don’t bully my grandma!”

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,320
Dang! He seems genuinely angry.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,160
And these police,

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,420
well, they’re not really police.

26
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,920
They’re called “chengguan” or “urban
management.”

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
Chengguan are the taskforce that’s supposed
to enforce city laws

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,850
related to street vendors, traffic, and so
on.

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,689
But they have a reputation for being corrupt.

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,380
And brutal.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,909
Like that time in 2011

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,849
when chengguan beat a one-legged fruit vendor
to death.

33
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,380
Or in 2013,

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,930
when chengguan beat a watermelon vendor to
death.

35
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,560
Or in 2014,

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,030
when chengguan assistants beat a 70-year-old
man to death.

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,479
I mean, he did criticize them.

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,800
But clearly,

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,220
a three-year-old couldn’t have read those
articles.

40
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,029
No, he just intrinsically understands that these
chengguan are bad guys.

41
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,220
And if they’re after his grandma,

42
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,229
it’s worth taking the most extreme action
to stop them.

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,860
And the videos of this kid have become online
sensations in China,

44
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,829
getting millions of views.

45
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,219
Although there’s not much info on who this
kid is

46
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,869
or what the chengguan were doing to his grandma,

47
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,849
it seems every netizen has an opinion.

48
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,140
This weibo user writes:

49
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,649
“His grandmother is so blessed.”

50
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,770
This user said:

51
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,210
“...This proves that from a child’s perspective,

52
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,210
chengguan have a bad image. Thought-provoking.”

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,940
And this user writes:

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,340
“This little boy has gone mad...

55
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,860
and the adults don’t know how to restrain
him.”

56
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,040
There was even an online survey that got more
than 100,000 responses.

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,510
47% said “The kid’s just protecting his
family,

58
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,310
that’s all.”

59
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,080
35% said “First, I need to know if the chengguan

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
had roughed them up prior [to the video].”

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
And 18% said “It’s a bit troubling

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,510
a child this young is resisting the law.”

63
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,420
I feel like this survey might be more of a reflection

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,280
on what Chinese people think of standing up
to authority in general.

65
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,320
And authorities better watch out.

66
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,890
Because someday, this toddler

67
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,570
might become the next Ip Man.

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,580
So what do you think?
