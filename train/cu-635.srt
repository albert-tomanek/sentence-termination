1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,760
Chinese soldiers were killed

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,410
in last summer’s India-China border clash.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,530
But the numbers don’t add up.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,980
And no one is allowed to question it.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,850
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,240
The Chinese military now says four Chinese
soldiers were killed in a border clash with

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
India.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,789
If that sounds like old news, it is.

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,300
That border clash was more than six months
ago—and the Chinese military are only reporting

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,600
it now.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,250
That incident in June 2020 was the first deadly
clash in the border area in at least 45 years.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,110
Chinese and Indian soldiers had engaged in
hand to hand combat, in the dark, on dangerous

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,120
mountain slopes.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,300
Within a few days, the Indian military had
reported 20 deaths on their side.

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,000
And they held public funerals to pay tribute
to the fallen soldiers.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,060
“In the initial days after the clash, unconfirmed
reports in Indian media put the number of

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,190
Chinese dead as high as 45.

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,470
More recently, an Indian security official
said Friday that the military estimates at

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,210
least 14 Chinese soldiers were wounded, eight
of whom later died.”

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,350
But either way, that’s a lot more than four—the
number that China’s military claimed a few

21
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,930
weeks ago.

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,920
It has to be way less than the number of Indians
who died.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,290
Otherwise, China will look weak.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,710
In a pointless border clash where everyone
loses, it’s still important to win.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,909
China’s announcement came with a propaganda
video that shows brave Chinese soldiers at

26
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,200
the border diplomatically diffusing tensions
with the Indian side.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,420
And it eulogizes the four soldiers who were
said to have died.

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,150
They died, by the way, not at the hands of
the Indian soldiers—no!

29
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,880
They died trying to rescue their comrades.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,670
But I have some bad news: Some Chinese netizens
saw this and began questioning whether what

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,280
state-run media were reporting really adds
up.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,230
The good news is: China already has a law
to handle that.

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,530
And Chinese police have begun arresting people
for 'insulting' the Chinese soldiers killed

34
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,709
in the India border clash.

35
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,340
In 2018, China had passed a law that bans
people from ‘insulting or slandering heroes

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,700
and martyrs.’

37
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,720
And under new rules that took effect last
week, people who ‘insult, slander or use

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,270
other means to infringe the reputation and
honor of heroes and martyrs and damage the

39
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,020
public interest of society’ can be jailed
for up to three years.

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,230
One of the six people Chinese police have
detained is Qiu Ziming.

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:15,340
He’s a former reporter and a verified Weibo
user who goes by the username Spicy Pen Ball.

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,720
He’s got two-and-a-half million followers.

43
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,080
A few weeks ago, he posted some comments expressing
his skepticism about the Chinese military’s

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,459
official death toll.

45
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,180
“Of course the highest ranked official stays
alive.

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,900
I bet he’s got a ‘runaway’ personality.

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,989
And of course, ‘the Indian troops held their
heads and ran away from us.’

48
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,739
Anyway, we won.”

49
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,739
“Think about it like this.

50
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,830
If the government says these 4 soldiers died
trying to ‘rescue’ other soldiers, then

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,500
there must be other soldiers who weren’t
rescued.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,400
There’s definitely more casualties than
reported.

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,890
This makes me understand why India was so
fast to report their casualties, because in

54
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,870
their eyes, India had won, as their losses
were less than China’s.”

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,549
It’s hard to know whether Spicy Pen Ball
is correct.

56
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,410
But one thing’s for sure.

57
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,030
His comments were politically incorrect.

58
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:46,199
And by the end of the day, the Weibo platform
itself posted this announcement.

59
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,240
Which is weird, because he didn’t actually
mention the names of the fallen soldiers,

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,100
or actually slander them.

61
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,009
But if you think blocking the account for
a year is too harsh, you’re wrong.

62
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,960
Because a few hours later, the Weibo platform
posted this update, saying that “According

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,080
to the law, all accounts under Spicy Pen Ball’s
name have been closed”, presumably forever.￼

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,419
And then the company that Spicy Pen Ball—Qiu
Ziming—used to work for, The Economic Observer,

65
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,900
rushed to disown him.

66
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,259
“IMPORTANT NOTICE: Weibo User @Spicy Pen
Ball has been banned for his slandering and

67
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,450
bad influence.

68
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,290
Qiu Ziming left our company in 2015.

69
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,850
His opinions are not affiliated with our company.

70
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:47,820
The staff at The Economic Observer are very
respectful and mournful over the sacrifices

71
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,330
of our country’s heroes, and we condemn
any slandering on their behalf!”

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,750
Yes, Qiu’s post was so influential that
the company he worked at six years ago had

73
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,680
to come out and deny any affiliation with
him.

74
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,110
The next day, the Nanjing police issued a
notice declaring that they had taken action

75
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,169
on this serious, serious issue.

76
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:22,030
It says, “On the night of February 19, police
captured the perpetrator Spicy Pen Ball.

77
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:29,590
Spicy Pen Ball has confessed to his ill intention
of seeking attention by bending the truth...

78
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,449
The Nanjing Police have placed Spicy Pen Ball
in criminal detention under suspicion of the

79
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,840
crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble.

80
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,620
Slandering heroes is intolerable.

81
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,000
The internet is not outside of the law.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,370
The Public Security Bureau will severely punish
those who distort, defame, or deny the heroism

83
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,120
of our soldiers.\h

84
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,940
We hope all internet users understand and
follow this law, and help build a healthier

85
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,639
and friendly internet community.”

86
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,650
Yes, nothing creates a healthy and friendly
community like arresting everyone who commits

87
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,790
thoughtcrime.

88
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,990
And Spicy Pen Ball’s situation is not unique.

89
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,069
Local police bureaus across China have made
similar posts, saying they’ve arrested netizens

90
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,880
who have quote-unquote slandered the names
of the nations’ heroes.

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,460
Even Chinese people living overseas aren’t
safe.

92
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,259
I’ll tell you more after the break.

93
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,120
Welcome back.

94
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,870
Even Chinese people outside China are under
threat if they hold politically incorrect

95
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,940
views about what happened on the India-China
border.

96
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,680
In February, a Chinese citizen living in Europe
named Wang Jingyu took to Chinese social media

97
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,630
to express a pretty direct criticism of Chinese
soldiers.

98
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,910
￼
It says, “Serves those soldiers right.

99
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,830
They were looking for trouble and they got
it.

100
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,900
The Indian soldiers did a good job.”

101
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,520
Obviously, this comment is not very positive
towards the Chinese soldiers.

102
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,480
And it implies that Chinese soldiers started
the conflict because they were looking for

103
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,900
trouble.

104
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,840
So a bunch of Chinese netizens rushed to find
Wang Jingyu’s information to report him

105
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,819
to the police.

106
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:33,599
But bad news: Wang Jingyu left China in 2019,
and he lives outside of the Chinese police’s

107
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,729
jurisdiction.

108
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,240
The good news is: Chinese police can use his
parents in China as collateral!

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,229
They sent him this text message.

110
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,410
“Wang Jingyu: This is the Tanjiagang police.

111
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,640
You have three days to surrender yourself,
or else your parents will have a hard time.”

112
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,050
Hm, well the police sure are informative!

113
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,980
Wang Jingyu called the police back several
times to ask for more details.

114
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,030
Here’s his last attempt.

115
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:17,750
“Hello, is this the Chongqing Shapingba
District police?\h

116
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,250
[pause] Yes.

117
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,510
Hi.

118
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:29,720
You texted me earlier, I wanted to ask what
criminal offense I’ve done…

119
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,910
[No response]
\hHello?

120
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,910
Hello?

121
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,810
I’ll give you all of my information if you
could look me up and tell me what I did wrong.

122
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,810
Hello?

123
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,810
Hello?

124
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,080
What is up with the police?

125
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,020
How come when I call you you’re not saying
anything?

126
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,570
You’ve been calling me nonstop the past
two days to surrender.

127
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,250
And now I’m here, and you’re not doing
anything?

128
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,270
You’re the police, I’m the criminal, why
are you afraid of me?

129
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,270
Hello?

130
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,270
Hello?

131
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,270
Police?

132
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
Hello?

133
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:09,029
This is my right, you need to inform me what
crimes I’ve committed.”

134
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,321
But even though Wang Jingyu is free according
to European law to express his views, his

135
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:17,390
comments brought shame to his entire family.

136
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,280
And by “brought shame,” I mean Chinese
police detained his parents.

137
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,540
“According to reports, Wang Jingyu’s parents
were held in the police station from 6 o’clock

138
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,100
in the morning until night time…

139
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,260
At night, two police, one man and one woman,
would escort Wang Jingyu’s parents home

140
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,480
and monitor them overnight.

141
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,850
The male policeman would sleep with the father,
and the policewoman would sleep with the mother,

142
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,310
and the parents would be escorted back to
the police station the next day.”

143
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,660
OK, I know Chinese police often go overboard.

144
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,700
But sleeping with the parents?

145
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,600
That’s just weird.

146
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,550
But the point is, no matter where you live,
if you question the Chinese Communist Party's

147
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,100
official narrative, prepare to face consequences.

148
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,820
Unless you’re like me, in which case you
just get demonetized by YouTube.

149
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,040
Speaking of which, the only reason we can
withstand all the suppression and demonetization

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,980
from YouTube is because we’re mainly supported
directly by viewers like you—folks who contribute

151
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,959
a dollar or more through Patreon.

152
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,720
And as a thank you to our supporters, I answer
their questions at the end of some of my episodes.\h

153
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,250
Today’s question comes from Lunar Worx.

154
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,810
“I once heard from an expat that Chinese
police don't put much effort into policing

155
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,209
poor areas of their country.

156
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:51,240
Do Chinese police only fight crime when it's
convenient for the CCP?”

157
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,180
No, no Lunar Worx.

158
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,910
Firstly, there are police all over China.

159
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,279
China spends more money on internal security
than on national defence.

160
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
So even if you’re in the smallest, most
remote, village, as long as you have internet

161
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,990
access and post something that questions the
official narrative, the Chinese police WILL

162
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,710
FIND YOU.

163
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,170
