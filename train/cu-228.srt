1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,880
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,110
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hosting

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,319
the annual BRICS Summit.

4
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:06,319
And he’s proving,

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,980
that Xi’s a BRICS house!

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,460
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,350
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,250
This week was the annual BRICS Summit

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,370
in Xiamen, China.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,660
It’s a meeting between the world’s l

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,710
argest developing economies—

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,800
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,190
Personally I think they should have

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,679
gone with SBRIC

15
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,010
or maybe BRISC.

16
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,789
That’s BRISC, baby.

17
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,230
Together, these five BRICS countries

18
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,440
make up 40% of the world’s population,

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,700
25% of the world’s landmass,

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,699
and almost 30% of the global GDP.

21
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,339
Now while you might be thinking:

22
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:51,159
This BRICS Summit sounds like

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,350
the most boring meeting on Earth.

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,800
Fortunately, state-run China Central Television

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,019
knows how to make it cool.

26
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,690
With a Fast and Furious style death race!

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,479
On a volcano!

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,360
The meeting faces many challenges,

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,180
like dangerous roads!

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,680
Lava explosions!

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,800
And electric rocks shaped like letters!

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,890
But when the road starts to

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,320
crumble underneath them,

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,530
these five rivals will join together

35
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,010
and accomplish the impossible!

36
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,250
Jumping over a cliff!

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,361
Wow, the BRICS Summit

38
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,520
must be so cool!

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,080
Let’s take a look at the actual footage.

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,780
Almost as cool?

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,760
Now I understand why CCTV did that animation.

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,730
So what did the real-life versions

43
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,630
of those race car drivers discuss

44
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,710
during their three-day extravaganza?

45
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,710
One thing,

46
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,950
as I mentioned earlier in the broadcast,

47
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,530
is that they’re all angry at North Korea

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,280
for trying to upstage their party

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,920
with a nuclear test.

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,500
But looming over the three day summit

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,810
was the intense rivalry smoldering

52
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,230
between the two biggest countries:

53
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,770
India and China.

54
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,210
For about 70 days,

55
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,219
India and China were locked in a serious border
dispute

56
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:12,459
that threatened to turn into full blown war.

57
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,459
And by threatened,

58
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,980
I mean—Chinese state-run media

59
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,140
was threatening war.

60
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,209
And that was just a symptom

61
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,650
of much deeper tensions

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,599
between the two nations.

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,410
The dispute was eventually resolved,

64
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,390
with both sides saving face,

65
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,719
just in time for the BRICS summit.

66
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,350
And the two leaders both seemed amicable enough...

67
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,060
But things are far from smooth between India
and China.

68
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,200
They’re still economic and political rivals.

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,099
Oh, and military rivals.

70
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,800
On the Friday before the summit,

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,659
China held live fire drills in the Indian
Ocean.

72
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,680
Or as the Chinese Communist Party calls it,

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,469
the “Southwest China Sea.”

74
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,019
I’m just kidding.

75
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,739
I think.

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,480
But speaking of territorial disputes,

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
those also made their way into the summit.

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,340
Xi Jinping was pushing his One Belt One Road
Initiative.

79
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,829
He says it will link China and the rest of
Eurasia together

80
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,540
for mutual economic prosperity and high-speed
car chases.

81
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,609
But India considers it a debt-fueled disaster

82
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,689
that will see China surrounding India

83
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,690
and threatening its sovereignty.

84
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,099
A huge part of the plan involves

85
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,920
the China Pakistan Economic Corridor—

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
which would go through territory

87
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,610
that India disputes with Pakistan.

88
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,950
Pakistan is of course a major rival to India

89
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,360
over more than just territory.

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,430
India considers Pakistan

91
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,280
a source of terrorism.

92
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,599
Yes, terrorism.

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,599
That’s another point

94
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,370
that China and India square off over.

95
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,279
Since China is pretty buddy buddy with Pakistan,

96
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,129
the Chinese regime has used its spot

97
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,829
as permanent member on the UN security council

98
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,430
to block India’s attempts to have the leader

99
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,499
of the Pakistan-based terrorist group

100
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,889
Jaish-e-Mohammad

101
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,010
put on a terror blacklist.

102
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,170
Yes, China has blocked the leader

103
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,230
of a terrorist organization

104
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,659
from being labeled a terrorist.

105
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,400
But India won a round on that front

106
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,870
at this BRICS Summit.

107
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,840
In the 43-page joint statement

108
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,379
put out during the summit,

109
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,129
tackling terrorism was a key point.

110
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,249
And it specifically called out

111
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,650
Pakistan based groups

112
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,150
like Lashkar-e-Taiba

113
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,650
and Jaish-e-Mohammad,

114
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,180
alongside ISIS and al-Qaida.

115
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,040
That may put a strain on China-Pakistan ties.

116
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,960
Another reason the Chinese regime

117
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,090
is concerned about India

118
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,620
is its ties to the United States.

119
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,450
Beijing is leery of being surrounded by US
allies,

120
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,199
like South Korea, Japan, Australia, and India.

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,680
So smoothing over recent tensions

122
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,949
to ensure India came to BRICS

123
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,590
is part of a long term plan

124
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,740
to make India,

125
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,180
and all the other countries,

126
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,060
more reliant on China instead of the West.

127
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,620
A big part of that is the New Development
Bank.

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,740
It was started two years ago by the BRICS
countries.

129
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,030
The idea is to rival the World Bank and the
IMF.

130
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,840
The New Development Bank is equally funded

131
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,500
by all five BRICS countries:

132
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,210
And it will offer loans for projects in those
countries—

134
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,960
without all the strings attached

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,490
that Western countries tend to add.

136
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,490
Worthless strings,

137
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,710
like government transparency

138
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,820
and human rights.

139
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,129
The New Development Bank is probably

140
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,129
the most concrete thing to come out of

141
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,449
the BRICS Summits in recent years.

142
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,940
Each country has pledged

143
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,050
$10 billion dollars to it so far.

144
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,800
The first project it funded

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,930
is a solar energy plant in China.

146
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,479
And one of the next projects it will fund

147
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,410
is a drinking water system in rural India.

148
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,810
Of course China’s $10 billion investment

149
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,539
in the New Development Bank is small

150
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,159
compared to the $120 billion

151
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,340
Xi Jinping pledged to his One Belt,

152
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,129
One Road initiative back in May.

153
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:42,180
So he’s still giving priority to that.

154
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,419
But as much as the Chinese regime

155
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,310
would like India to become economically dependent
on China,

156
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,970
the plan may have backfired a bit.

157
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,360
Because while Xi’s back was turned,

158
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,530
these two got to talking on the sidelines.

159
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,220
Modi and Putin got to talking about

160
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,710
their own trade and investment deals.

161
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,250
And that was after the two signed defense
and energy deals

162
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,260
worth billions last October.

163
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,600
I mean Putin, whose side are you on?

164
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,460
Look, Xi Jinping just wanted to put on a good
party.

165
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,949
And of course the US wasn’t invited.

166
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,439
There a Chinese Opera,

167
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,360
set in what looks suspiciously like China’s

168
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,710
sacred territory in the South China Sea.

169
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,389
Putin seems uncomfortable.

170
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,740
There was even pie...or least metaphors about
pie.

171
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,960
"The development of emerging markets

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,160
and developing countries

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,040
won’t touch anyone’s cheese,

174
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,600
but instead will diligently grow

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,860
the world economic pie.”

176
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,340
What’s with the cheese thing?

177
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,979
Has Xi Jinping been reading self help books
again?

178
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,090
"We will grow the world economic pie

179
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,520
by manifesting it through the law of attraction

180
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,050
of the universe.

181
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,069
Visualize the pie.

182
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,980
The big cheese pie.”

183
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Oh no, he’s moved on to The Secret.

184
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,270
No one show him The Power of Now.

185
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,270
But overall,

186
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,009
relations between India and China are better

187
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,030
than they were during the recent military
standoff.

188
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,030
At the same time,

189
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,220
India is still suspicious of what China has
to offer.

190
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,500
And that might mean team BRICS

191
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,439
will never make it to the top of volcano mountain.

192
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,349
But at least they’ll always have a big cheese
pie?

193
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,680
And coming up after the break,

194
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,389
the Chinese Communist Party is being threatened
by ISIS.

195
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,430
Which makes this whole India rivalry

196
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,780
look like a playground scuffle.

197
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,240
Hey, if you really want to smile,

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
get on over to China Uncensored.tv.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
There you’ll see loads more China Uncensored

200
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,259
you won’t see anywhere else,

201
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,449
including full half hour episodes.

202
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,650
And you don’t even have to pay for it.

203
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,800
However if you’d like to support China Uncensored,

204
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,479
also make a trip to the website Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored,

206
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,140
That would make me smile.
