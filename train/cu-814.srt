00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,429
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,800
To know the future, you must understand the
past.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,850
If you've been to any Chinese restaurant in
the United States,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,689
you've been served a fortune cookie.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,420
A lovely little saying, some lucky numbers,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,660
maybe it teaches you a word in Mandarin.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,020
Yes, fortune cookies are a beloved Chinese
restaurant tradition all around the world.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,430
But why can't you find fortune cookies in
China?

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,390
In fact, the ancient art of fortune cookies
was nearly lost forever.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,520
It was a dark time in China's history.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,250
One that few people even know about.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,940
So today, we bring you a China Uncensored
exclusive investigation

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,740
into the secret history of the fortune cookie.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,270
The origins of the fortune cookie stretch
back to the roots of recorded Chinese history--the

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,520
Shang Dynasty.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,010
In a grand ceremony to determine the fortune
of the nation for the coming year,

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,860
the emperor would toss oracle bones into a
bronze "ding" vessel that would then be lit.

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,750
A mystic would interpret the cracks that formed
on the bones as predictions for the future.

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,290
Clearly, a feudalistic superstition.

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,680
That's why, during the Cultural Revolution,

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,300
when Mao Zedong began destroying the Four
Olds

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,790
--a systematic campaign to wipe out traditional
culture--

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,960
he targeted the fortune cookie.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
"That was the official reason Mao gave for
the

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,420
'Smash Confucius, Smash the Cookie' campaign.

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,060
But there were actually much more sinister
reasons behind it."

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,860
Dr. Iris Wolsey is one of the world’s foremost
experts on fortune cookies.

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,460
"After the Shang emperors,

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,120
it became a folk tradition.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,090
People started putting their own spirit tablets
with fortunes and charms written on them

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,750
in steamed rice cakes to celebrate the Lunar
New Year.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,340
Whoever ended up with the cake with the tablet
would have good fortune for the coming year."

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,920
"Unless they broke their teeth."

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,920
"At a certain point, they switched to paper."

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,580
But for Mao Zedong,

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,899
fortune cookies were more than just feudal
superstition.

39
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,739
They were also political.

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,900
During the late Ming Dynasty,

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,569
the making of fortune cookies became part
of esoteric rituals,

42
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,569
dominated by secretive clans with occult practices

43
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,490
rooted in geomancy, fengshui, and fortune
telling based on the Bagua and I-ching.

44
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,730
One of these clans had a charismatic leader

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,060
who convinced his followers that he had the will of Heaven,

46
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,569
and the will of heaven

47
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,569
was for him to become
Emperor.

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,260
That led to the Le Zaohua, or Happy Good Luck,
Uprising of 1629,

49
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,870
and later the 1633 Chang Fu, or Everlasting
Fortune, Rebellion.

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,510
Which they most definitely were not.

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,090
Both rebellions failed,

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,030
but they greatly weakened the Ming Dynasty.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,390
And they were partly responsible for the dynasty's
collapse and conquest by the Manchus in 1644.

54
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,319
So it's no wonder that,

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,640
in the 20th century,

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,550
Mao Zedong was afraid the fortune cookie could
threaten his rule.

57
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,180
At least that's the accepted scholarly interpretation.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,620
But it turns out, there might be more to the
story...

59
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,030
"No, no that's totally wrong.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,870
That's not why Mao turned against fortune
cookies at all."

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,230
I went to Manhattan's Chinatown to interview
Jing Fong.

62
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,349
He's a seventh generation fortune cookie master
from the southern Har Gow school.

63
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,809
His was one of only a handful of fortune cookie families

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,400
that left China before the Cultural Revolution,

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,570
and have carried on the tradition overseas.

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,060
"I've been making fortune cookies for nearly
40 years."

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,851
"You...don't look that old."

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,220
"My mother put a fortune cookie in my hand
before I learned to walk."

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,660
His fortune cookie factory now supplies nearly
one quarter of the Chinese restaurants in

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,200
the United States.

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,500
"Mao was a secret believer in the power of
Fortune Cookies.

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,099
That’s why during the Chinese Civil War,

73
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,400
when the Communists were fighting the Nationalists,

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,640
Mao had his troops use fortune cookies to
deliver secret messages between Revolutionary cells.

75
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,760
He believed it was the fortune cookies that
helped him win the war."

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,300
But according to these memoirs written by Mao’s doctor,

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,769
Mao later became obsessed with fortune cookies.

78
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,979
Especially after several predictions proved
eerily correct.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,720
"You mean, the fortunes were accurate?"

80
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,259
"Yes.

81
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,669
One fortune Mao got read,

82
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,020
'When metal is depleted, the earth will become
weak.'

83
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,370
That's based on the Five Elements theory.

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,889
Earth generates Metal.

85
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,229
The five elements theory is a profound skill
that Chinese people use to predict the future.

86
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,199
From this perspective,

87
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,739
Mao was using a skill that he didn't completely
grasp."

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
According to Jing,

89
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:48,270
Mao thought this prediction meant that unless
he increased steel production,

90
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,599
the “earth,” or China, would be weak and
vulnerable to foreign invasion.

91
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,509
So during the Great Leap forward,

92
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,270
he drove the entire population into steel
production.

93
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,039
Even in rural areas, entire forests were leveled
just to fuel the furnaces.

94
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,400
But it was all a waste.

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,819
They couldn’t get the temperatures high
enough and so the metal was brittle and useless.

96
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,719
In fact, that was one of the contributing
factors to the Great Famine.

97
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,389
"'When metal is depleted,

98
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:18,879
the earth will become weak.'

99
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,569
30 million people starved to death.

100
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,199
The Earth element correlates to the stomach."

101
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,060
"Whooooaaaa."

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,600
"There were other fortunes, too.

103
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,889
The entire reason Mao blocked Zhou Enlai from
getting treatment for his cancer

104
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,520
is because of a fortune cookie predicting
that if Mao died first,

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,760
Zhou would take over his legacy."

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
"And it’d be Zhou’s face up in Tiananmen
today.

107
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,990
Wow, so, I’m really impressed by the history
of your art.

108
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,219
I was wondering,

109
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,889
can I have one of your fortune cookies?"

110
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,839
"Knowing the future can be a burden as much
as it is a gift."

111
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,400
"I’ll take my chances."

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,309
"'You will have the number one show on YouTube.'

113
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,919
Oh wow!!!

114
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,319
Oh. Wait there’s more...

115
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,939
'Visit Learn Chinese Now for the true meaning.'"

116
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,649
And thank you for watching.

117
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,229
What do you like most about fortune cookies?

118
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,889
And if you comment below—

119
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,639
no spoilers please.

120
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,770
Once again I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.

121
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,089
OK, so for the real story behind this episode,

122
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,229
here's my friend Ben Hedges from Learn Chinese
Now.

123
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,869
Yu ren jie.

124
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:40,219
That’s how you say April Fool's day in Chinese!

125
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,199
So when an elementary student

126
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,520
tells his teacher
that the principal wants to see him in his office,

127
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,229
and he actually goes there to find it was
fake...

128
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,399
Yu ren jie.

129
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,569
That was me who pulled that one.

130
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,300
When the BBC tells you spaghetti grows on
trees...

131
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
The last two weeks of March

132
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
are an anxious time for the spaghetti farmer.

133
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
After picking,

134
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,320
the spaghetti is laid out to dry in the warm Alpine sun.

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,479
Yep,

136
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,659
it's yu ren jie.

137
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,249
Or when you see a video that says "traditional"
Chinese Fortune Cookies

138
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,589
were suppressed by the Communists but preserved
in America.

139
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:17,089
It must be

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,980
yu ren jie.

141
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,659
Sorry to break the illusion.

142
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,349
You guys really believed that right?

143
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,889
But Chris, the Communists did suppress a lot
of stuff right?

144
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,779
I mean Chinese American food uses a lot of
broccoli.

145
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,780
That is surely one of the cuisines that were
suppressed in the cultural revolution right?

146
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,759
I wish the communists had suppressed broccoli.

147
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,759
It's the bane of a good General Tsao's Chicken.
