00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,880
two Chinas for the price of one!

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,420
Or,

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,800
one China for the price of two.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,300
I’m not really sure how this works.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,160
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,760
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,820
Remember how it felt during gym class

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,320
when they were picking kids for the team

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,480
and you were the one no one wanted?

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,090
Obviously I can’t relate to that because
I’m extremely athletic.

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,939
But that’s essentially what happened to
Taiwan.

13
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,590
When the world had to pick their favorite
China—

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,680
the Communist Party of China in the Mainland

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,390
or the Republic of China in Taiwan,

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,710
the world chose the Communist Party to have
diplomatic relations with.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,040
Which is strange considering the shape the
two leaders were in.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,520
But anyway, very few countries picked Taiwan

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,660
to be on their diplomacy team.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,149
And now, even though for all intents and purposes

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,239
Taiwan is a separate country,

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,960
only a small handful of countries acknowledges
it.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,219
And so, since the Communist Party of China

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,880
was the cool kid that got picked, it’s been
bullying Taiwan.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,010
By pointing missiles at it and threatening
to invade.

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,300
So I sat down with Ian East, a research fellow
at Project 2049,

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,240
to discuss the Communist Party’s plans to
invade Taiwan.

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,100
Thank you for joining us today, Ian.

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,740
Chris, it's a pleasure to be here.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,840
All right, so the Chinese Communist Party

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,250
says Taiwan is a province of China.

32
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,329
The Chinese Communist Party also says

33
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,650
it plans to invade Taiwan by 2020.

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,610
My question is how can China invade itself?

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,540
That's a very good question.

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,600
It's not at all clear that China is capable
of invading itself,

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,180
nor is it clear that Taiwan is actually part
of

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,610
the People's Republic of China.

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,600
How dare you.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,920
It's sad but true that Xi Jinping and the
Chinese Communist Party

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,850
have this narrative as part of the CCP's creation
myth,

42
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,830
as you're well aware, that they control or
ought try to control

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,480
or to administer of the Republic of China—Taiwan.

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,280
But actually since December 1949,

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,450
Taiwan has been operating as a free and independent
country.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,590
So not one China.

47
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,290
Well, they've both for a long time,

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,300
both the Republic of China government

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,360
and the People's Republic of China government
maintained

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,900
that they were the legitimate government and
that there was only one—

51
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
that is, a zero sum game.

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,250
The Highlander Policy.

53
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,400
It's very much the Highlander Policy.

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,950
And unfortunately the US government played
into that,

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,959
and that was a choice that was made in 1970s.

56
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,010
To continue to play into it...

57
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,489
Yeah, well UN, too.

58
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,050
Countries around the world until this day,

59
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,620
mostly because they're afraid of thinking
about any alternative solution.

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,440
Because of course, alternatives do exist.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,019
Policy is, it's manmade and it's flexible
and we as a sovereign country

62
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,659
can define what our policy is.

63
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,580
And I'm not advocating for anything in particular,

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,129
but one of the things that I've tried to do
with my research

65
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,650
and that we here as an institute at the Project
2049 try to do

66
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,200
is just lay out the facts as best as we can
and one of the facts is—

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,019
and this is a little controversial,

68
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,440
a little uncomfortable for people in Beijing—

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,470
is that the PRC has never, for a single day,

70
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,761
actually ever controlled or administered Taiwan,

71
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,800
and Taiwan continues to exist as a free and
independent country.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Now.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,320
It's not treated by the rest of the world
that way,

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,980
but that is the objective reality.

75
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,730
And I know because I've lived in China and
I've lived in Taiwan

76
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,180
and I've lived in other countries like Japan,

77
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,110
and you can tell it's real.

78
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,990
So do you think the Communist Party's threat
of

79
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,260
actually invading Taiwan is at all serious?

80
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,310
Well, as far as I'm aware—and of course

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,050
my knowledge on this is limited—

82
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,970
as far as I'm aware, they've not actually

83
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,950
said they are going to invade Taiwan.

84
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,150
What happened was about eight years ago, nine
years ago,

85
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,030
the People's Liberation Army got the order
from the top leadership

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,840
in the Politburo to prepare to be ready to
invade Taiwan,

87
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,720
if so ordered, by the year 2020.

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,660
It's called the 2020 plan.

89
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,970
So that's a lot of steps.

90
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,160
Be prepared, be ready to be ordered...

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
If we order you...

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
To attack.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Right.

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,590
And so it's an aspiration.

95
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,760
And this has happened before in the past,

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,139
where the CCP civilian leadership has given
the armed wing

97
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,540
of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the
PLA.

98
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,530
I mean they are PLA too—or they are CCP
too—

99
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,710
every officer in the PLA is a member of the
Chinese Communist Party.

100
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,470
But it has given the armed wing,

101
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,440
this order that here's what you should aspire
to,

102
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,699
here's what you should get ready for, and
it's,

103
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,160
you know, I don't want to alarm you or any
of your viewers,

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,620
but it's pretty incredible when you think
about it that this has been

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,040
the PLA's marching orders since about 2008.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,360
And this is what drives them.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
So when you look at China's sweeping

108
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,979
military reform and modernization program,

109
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,940
when you look at this massive military buildup
that is going on in China,

110
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,810
this is the principal, primary objective.

111
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,870
They're preparing for a World War III,

112
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,230
because ultimately that's what would happen.

113
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,820
How would it cause World War III—an invasion
of Taiwan?

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,340
Well, if the Chinese were to actually attempt

115
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,750
a full-scale invasion and occupation of Taiwan,

116
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,000
it's almost certain that the United States

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,050
would come to Taiwan's defense.

118
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,370
And of course that could easily escalate to
a very dangerous place.

119
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,630
Why would the US come to Taiwan's defense?

120
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,290
Well, we have defense commitments to Taiwan

121
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,740
under the Taiwan Relations Act.

122
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,940
The Taiwan Relations Act is not a substitute
for or replacement

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,000
for a mutual defense treaty because of course
we did have a mutual

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,530
defense treaty with Taiwan from 1955 until
1978—first day of 1979—

125
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,320
and then we broke that when we switched diplomatic
relations,

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,080
and closed the embassy in Taipei, opened a
new embassy in Beijing.

127
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,470
And since that time, the Taiwan Relations
Act and also president Reagan's

128
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,610
six assurances to Taiwan and most recently
the Taiwan Travel Act,

129
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,440
have become our guidelines, and they lay out
our legal obligations

130
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,449
to Taiwan and they also talk a little bit
to some of our ethical,

131
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,009
our moral obligations to Taiwan, because Taiwan
has long been our ally—

132
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,690
or the Republic of China has long been our
ally—historically.

133
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,440
And we fought World War II together.

134
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,330
We were allied throughout the Cold War together.

135
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,300
And now Taiwan has become a democracy since
the 1990s.

136
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,639
And because it's a democracy, because the
Taiwanese do enjoy

137
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,350
popular sovereignty and they do have American-style
elections

138
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,630
every four years the same as we do, there
is a certain sentiment

139
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,699
that as a matter of principle,

140
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,080
the United States must help protect Taiwan.

141
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,300
So it's not just the legal obligation that
that's spelled out

142
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,550
in the Taiwan Relations Act.

143
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,430
There's a lot more to it than just that.

144
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,330
So what does Taiwan need to defend itself?

145
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,910
Well, that's a very good question And it's
not easy to answer

146
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,889
because for the past 20 years,

147
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,729
what has become the world's second largest
economy,

148
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,680
second most powerful country on the planet
now—the PRC—

149
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,169
has invested a tremendous amount of time and
human talent

150
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,639
and national treasure in building up its military,

151
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,540
tailor-making its military, for just this
scenario.

152
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,431
And so in light of that, a country like Taiwan—

153
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:15,160
Taiwan is about the world's 15th largest economy—

154
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,360
it's very difficult for Taiwan on its own
to balance,

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,039
to keep any kind of balance, military balance,

156
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,090
against a country of China's size.

157
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,180
Taiwan has 23 million people.

158
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,370
China has one point 3 billion-plus people.

159
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,050
And so when you look at the defense of Taiwan,
when you look at

160
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,930
Taiwan's national picture, it's not just Taiwan
alone;

161
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,540
it's not Taiwan just isolated;

162
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,769
it's not just Taiwan versus China.

163
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,130
There's also that American component that's
there,

164
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,060
and there are other democracies around the
world like Japan and Australia

165
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,630
that don't support Taiwan in any meaningful
sense

166
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,890
in terms of defense hardware

167
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:05,310
or defense training, but also support Taiwan
economically and morally.

168
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,740
Because when you're as isolated as Taiwan
is internationally,

169
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,779
when you are a country that is not treated

170
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,000
by the rest of the world as a country,

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,430
things like that, that moral support, matters
a great deal.

172
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,580
Why does that exist?

173
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,550
What would happen to the regional security

174
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,010
of the area if mainland China did seize control
of Taiwan?

175
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,480
So that's one of the interesting things

176
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
that PLA generals and staff officers

177
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,380
actually think about and write about.

178
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,040
And you can actually go into internal PLA
documents

179
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,920
and you can read about their rationale for
engaging

180
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,860
in this type of what they know would be a
very,

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,330
very dangerous military operation—

182
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,470
not just military,

183
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,460
but political would be very dangerous for
their entire regime...

184
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
Well, yeah.

185
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
Because the United States, Japan, they would
all get involved.

186
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,440
Right, and Taiwan itself is actually a lot
better defended

187
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
than most people realize.

188
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,480
It has a lot of advantages that the PLA is
very well aware of...

189
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Like what?

190
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,530
That they go to great lengths to try to cover
up.

191
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,670
So for example, this is just one example:

192
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,060
The Taiwan Strait is probably the windiest
place

193
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,080
in the northern hemisphere.

194
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,120
And so those waters are extremely difficult
to get across,

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,350
because of the nature of the currents, the
tides,

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,450
the sea states, the winds and the waves.

197
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,170
And so there are only two seasons of the year—

198
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,430
and they're both short windows of time;

199
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,120
one is in April; the other's in October—

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,380
where you could actually mount a large-scale
amphibious operation.

201
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,270
And the problem, of course with April is the
fog.

202
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,270
It's very,

203
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,500
very foggy according to PLA studies,

204
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,670
because they've been studying the weather
patterns

205
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,019
for almost 70 years in the Taiwan Strait,
and it's very foggy in April.

206
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,019
It's kind of rainy.

207
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,959
So it's not ideal, but based on the sea states

208
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,149
it's still the best time to go if you're going
to invade Taiwan.

209
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,421
The other best time to go would be October.

210
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,950
October is even better because it's not as
foggy.

211
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,410
But the problem with October is sometimes
you have late season typhoons.

212
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,920
Taiwan is hit by an average of six to seven
typhoons a year.

213
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,570
Also a big problem for and amphibious operations,

214
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,430
but most of those typhoons are between July
and September.

215
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:33,990
And so October often represents a good time
of year to go for an invasion.

216
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,740
But again, you can have a late season typhoon

217
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,720
and that could throw things off.

218
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,790
And for the PLA, once they were to secure
a beachhead,

219
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,160
then they have to feed that beachhead.

220
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,279
They have to supply it.

221
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,750
They have to build it up.

222
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,779
And that becomes difficult once November rolls
around,

223
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,960
because then you have winter squalls.

224
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,110
So that's just one of the many things

225
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,899
that PLA planners and strategists look at
it.

226
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,940
That's just the geographic piece.

227
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,470
They also look at the number of beaches that
they could land on,

228
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,470
and there's very few.

229
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,940
On the north side of Taiwan, right?

230
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,139
Very few landing spots.

231
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,680
Very few.

232
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,519
And they're shrinking over time for a number
of reasons.

233
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,960
So global warming is really playing a big
part in defending Taiwan.

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,180
Well, global warming and the fight against
global warming,

235
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,430
because actually Taiwan is moving towards
a more of a green economy

236
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,029
I guess you could say, and whenever they put
up one of those windmills

237
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,130
along the coast for wind power,

238
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,360
that actually creates an obstacle for PLA
helicopters and for landing ships.

239
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,290
Whenever they put a wave break off the coast
in order

240
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,810
to try to limit coastal erosion or whenever
they plant sharp spine agave

241
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,610
plants along the beaches, again to try to
prevent coastal erosion,

242
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,459
the PLA looks at that and they see a real
problem because it's shrinking

243
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,290
their operational space.

244
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,420
And so there's a lot that the Chinese military

245
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,010
looks at when they studied this problem that
they have.

246
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,010


247
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,010
They also look at Taiwan's missile capabilities.

248
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,149
They look at Taiwanese intelligence capabilities,

249
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,070
Taiwanese cyber and electronic warfare capabilities.

250
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,280
They look at the air force.

251
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,800
And the list goes on and on.

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,870
And so when they look at Taiwan, they see
a very big problem

253
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,860
that they have to solve and so they use—

254
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,240
and this gets back to your original question
about what would happen

255
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,420
to the region if Taiwan was lost—

256
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,910
well, one of the things that the Chinese military
writers

257
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,889
say is that once Taiwan is lost, then it's
going to be great for them.

258
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,210
That the geostrategic value of Taiwan is immense
because Taiwan

259
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,100
is at the center of the first island chain
and once they capture Taiwan,

260
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,670
they can turn it into a garrison state,

261
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,560
which would be very unpleasant place to live
because

262
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,740
you'd have a lot of PLA soldiers area to have

263
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,300
a lot of internal security forces there.

264
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300


265
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,199
You'd have tremendous human rights violations
on a massive scale.

266
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,839
It'd be awful for the people that live there
and they realize that.

267
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,790
But from their perspective,

268
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,100
it would be a great place to hold Japan hostage

269
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,090
because you can base fighter jets and bombers

270
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,120
and intelligence aircraft on Taiwan

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,690
and actually use that along with naval capabilities

272
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,300
to threaten to blockade the Japanese home
islands,

273
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,550
to cut off Japan sea lines of communication,

274
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,089
their air lines and communication.

275
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,029
Same applies to South Korea.

276
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,000
Same applies in a different direction to the
Philippines.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,139
And so because the Chinese Communist Party
would like China

278
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:41,800
to become a regional hegemon, to become the
preponderant political,

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,920
economic and military power in Asia,

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,470
they look at Taiwan and they see great opportunity.

281
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,520
They see as a very real threat,

282
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,510
but they also see an opportunity and that's
one of the rationales

283
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,760
that are driving their military buildup against
Taiwan.

284
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,950
In an article you wrote for the Taipei Times
you wrote

285
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,579
"the battle for the mind begins before the
battle of the fist."

286
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,579
What does that mean?

287
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,490
Well, it's a line I picked up in Kung Fu Panda.

288
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,490
Really?

289
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,790
It is.

290
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,959
And when I saw that—

291
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,139
and I've seen Kung Fu panda many times,

292
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:12,520
I think it's a great film—

293
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
You have children?

294
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,670
I do.

295
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,670
Yes.

296
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,130
And that's where I got it and I thought,

297
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,710
this captures perfectly what Xi Jinping

298
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,810
and the Chinese Communist Party and you know,

299
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,690
the entire security apparatus is doing to
Taiwan,

300
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,779
but also against other industrial democracies
everywhere,

301
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,920
is they are weakening our ability to put up
any kind of resistance

302
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,070
that they're convincing people everywhere—and
especially in Taiwan—

303
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,890
that resistance is futile.

304
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,460
That they are going to become the predominant
power,

305
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,320
that their economy will surpass us and ours,

306
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,810
and that there's very little that we can do
about it,

307
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,790
and so we should just start to cut deals with
them now,

308
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,430
and start to submit to their authority.

309
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,149
And one of the reasons that's so important
for them,

310
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,829
that strategic psychological warfare that
they're waging against Taiwan,

311
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,500
is so incredibly important because Taiwan
for a number of reasons

312
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,509
would be extremely, extremely difficult to
successfully invade and occupy,

313
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,949
and they realize that.

314
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,490
But it's only difficult if the Taiwanese
fight.

315
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,640
If the Taiwanese stand united, if the military,
once they're mobilized—

316
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,300
but even if the entire military is not mobilized
and you

317
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,570
just have the active duty guys that are on
station now—

318
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,529
if they fight, and if the citizens of Taiwan

319
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,519
stand united with the government,

320
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,900
with the military, the Chinese have very,

321
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,040
very little chance of actually succeeding.

322
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,220
Because the Taiwanese can hold out for a very
long period of time.

323
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,230
They can fight a protracted struggle.

324
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,889
At least for that month window where they

325
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,420
can actually launch it an invasion.

326
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,120
Yeah, and then some.

327
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,190
In order for the entire world to mobilize

328
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,720
and come to Taiwan's assistance.

329
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,240
And by the entire world, I mostly just mean
the United States,

330
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,550
because most other countries are less reliable

331
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,419
as far as Taiwan's concerned.

332
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,699
But—and less capable of course—

333
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:11,740
because this is something that our military

334
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,890
in the Pacific actually trains to.

335
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,280
This is one of the major driving forces for
a lot of the things

336
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,709
that that you see in the Indo Pacific region.

337
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,530
And so that's why China is trying to—or
the PRC—

338
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,660
is trying to undermine Taiwan through nonmilitary
means.

339
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,960
Absolutely because the military piece works
best—

340
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,190
and perhaps it could only work—

341
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,740
if all the other things that precede it work.

342
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,910
If they can weaken resolve, if they can intimidate,

343
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:50,700
if they can shock and undermine confidence
in Taiwan,

344
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,740
then they have a much better chance of actually
attaining

345
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,850
their goals and potentially—if they're really,

346
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,830
really good at it and really lucky

347
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,510
and if they can get the United States's help—

348
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,820
they could theoretically convince the Taiwanese

349
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,890
to surrender without much of a fight.

350
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,420
That's their goal, obviously.

351
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,270
Now their chances for success are extremely
small because

352
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,780
I don't think Washington is going to do what
Beijing wants

353
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,540
and completely sell Taiwan out, and convince
the Taiwanese

354
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,910
that they should surrender now and cut a good
deal now while they can.

355
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,240
I don't see that.

356
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,230
But there are some Americans that do advocate
something

357
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,070
along those lines.

358
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,440
So all this is running through your mind

359
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,960
while you're watching Kung Fu panda?

360
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
Absolutely.

361
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
Interesting moviegoing experience.

362
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Yeah.

363
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,621
So what, what are some actionable things that
the United States

364
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,120
could do to support Taiwan?

365
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,630
Well, the first thing that we need to do,

366
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,850
and I think we should do, as a country is
recognize the tremendous threat

367
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,740
that China poses to Taiwan's continued freedom
and democracy.

368
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,900
And that's a threat again, that that's much
more or is

369
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,490
at least as political as it is economic or
military.

370
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,150
And once that is fully recognized then the
US could come up with

371
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,880
actionable policy to help, prescriptions to
help deal with these symptoms

372
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,900
and the illness that exists across the Taiwan
Strait

373
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,560
because it is becoming increasingly unstable.

374
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,100
China is building up for this operation.

375
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,980
And we have no way to predict the future.

376
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,580
So we don't know what Xi Jinping's intentions
are.

377
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,310
We can look at some of his rhetoric, we can
look at some of his behavior.

378
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,200
We can look at things that are coming out
of the PLA.

379
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,970
And when you do look at that, it's a pretty
dark picture,

380
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,830
and it's darkening over time.

381
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,780
And so I think it behooves us to show a lot
more moral support

382
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,840
to Taiwan that could include things like sending
high level officials,

383
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,480
cabinet level officials to Taiwan, high ranking
general officers,

384
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,260
admirals to Taiwan, high ranking civilian
officials from the Pentagon,

385
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,170
officials from the Seventh Fleet, from the
Indo-Pacific Command.

386
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,710
We could also do ship visits to Taiwan, both
Navy and Coastguard visits.

387
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,990
We could do bilateral military exercises.

388
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,990
We could start making arms sales to Taiwan
regularized because

389
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,240
over the past ten years out of fear for Beijing's
reaction,

390
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,740
we've been freezing arm sales to Taiwan and
limiting the things

391
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,960
that we'll sell the Taiwanese.

392
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,380
So there's a whole range of things that we
could do in that space.

393
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,070
There's a tremendous amount of room for improvement
on this.

394
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,750
And so I think we as a country really have
our work cut out for us

395
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,100
if we're serious about keeping the peace in
the western Pacific.

396
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Thank you very much for joining me today,
Ian.

397
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,280
And thank you Chris.

398
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,600
Hey Ian, do you have more to say?

399
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
There’s no question.

400
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,190
Well, wouldn’t it be great if there was
some way

401
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,690
people could hear more from you?

402
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,669
That would be awesome.

403
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,470
Fortunately, we have a podcast—China Unscripted—

404
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,100
where we have like an hour’s worth of conversation

405
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
with this guy.

406
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,460
So if you want to listen,

407
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,830
listen up,

408
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,830
