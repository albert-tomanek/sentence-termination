1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,040
The US-Taiwan relationship is a little awkward.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,660
Because Beijing keeps causing drama

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,330
But should America even care about

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,019
hurting the feelings of the Chinese people?

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,700
No, these Chinese people.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,740
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,640
I’m Chris Chappell here in Taipei, Taiwan.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,630
You know, there are a lot of things the US
government

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,460
can’t say when it comes to Taiwan

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,180
because it would anger China’s communist
leaders.

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,550
And no one knows that better than William
Stanton,

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,450
the former director of the American Institute
in Taiwan.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,140
That’s the de facto US embassy here.

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,809
So he’s a former ambassador

15
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,960
who can’t be called an ambassador in a US
Embassy

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,070
that can’t be called an embassy

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,530
in a country that can’t be called a country.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,040
I sat down with him to talk about the future
of this country.

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,160
Thank you for joining me today.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,699
Pleasure to be with you.

21
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,550
So if I call you the former US ambassador
to Taiwan,

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,579
will I start a war with China?

23
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,110
Well you could.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,770
They're very, how should I say?

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,500
They're very orthodox about such questions-

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,810
Orthodox is an interesting word for it.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,810
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,900
Well, there's a lot of orthodoxy

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,870
when you're talking about China,

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,470
and they've got a lot of stipulations and
rules

31
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,860
and unfortunately in many ways,

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,080
the rest of the world often abides by them.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,580
You may have seen just yesterday I guess,

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,390
there was a news report that they had criticized

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,200
the 60 some odd countries that had congratulated
Tsai Ing-wen

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,870
on her election victory here in China,

37
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,430
and they said that was totally inappropriate.

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,790
So why is it that the president of the United
States

39
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,810
can meet with the leader of North Korea

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,800
but not the democratically elected president
of Taiwan?

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Beats me.

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,910
I've never understood it.

43
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:03,740
I mean we've had, why is it that up till now
officials ...

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,890
military people can go on the Pentagon from
Taiwan,

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,219
but we've never allowed even low level officials,

46
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,159
although periodically I know that's been changed.

47
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,439
But I mean we've had Jerry Adams,

48
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,320
a terrorist was in the state department,

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,260
I think Yasser Arafat at one point visited
the state department.

50
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,659
We've had all kinds of people come to the
state department,

51
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,069
we've had Russian spies,

52
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,350
we know that somebody came in

53
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,799
and bugged the state department at one point.

54
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,819
So why is it that a fellow democracy, a friendly
country,

55
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,569
people we ought to have a close relationship,

56
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,120
why do these old fashioned rules still guide
so many of our policies,

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,870
although Congress now is at least twice passed
laws that say

58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,230
we should have higher level visits from American
cabinet officers,

59
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,330
for example, come to Taiwan.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:04,030
And why is it that the Taiwanese also,

61
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,379
we've invited them to come at a higher level,

62
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,689
but that never happens because we're not getting
White House approval.

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,510
Well, it seems like for years the US government

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,370
has operated with the idea that we can't anger
China.

65
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,370
Why not?

66
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,879
Well, absolutely.

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,920
I mean I've often said we may have hurt

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,819
the feelings of the Chinese people,

69
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,930
but the Chinese government has hurt

70
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,849
the feelings of the American people

71
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,319
because they do some...

72
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,540
That's how I feel.

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,470
In a way you're exactly right.

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,680
I mean they do all kinds of things in terms
of

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,569
their treatment of Muslims and Christians
and,

76
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,529
the Falun Gong and any religion that they
find dubious

77
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:50,920
or doesn't strictly adhere to the preset serve
now,

78
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,489
Xi Jinping thought Marxist theory with Chinese
characteristics.

79
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,701
They object to it.

80
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:59,019
It hurts their feelings.

81
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,670
Well I'm sure most of the people of China
don't know and don't care,

82
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,700
but if you want they can come up I guess with
2 million blog items

83
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,639
saying that their feelings are hurt,

84
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,919
but we shouldn't care.

85
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:30,780
But you know, this has become such

86
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:49,030
a tradition.

87
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:57,540
We should never value a relationship for its
own sake.

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,171
You have a relationship with a country

89
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:09,700
because if it's in your 
mutual interests.

90
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:18,160
But we've also had over the years,

91
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,480
so many people who have retired from government

92
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,510
and then made money leading CEOs from America
to China

93
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,100
and getting paid for it.

94
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,530
And these people have maintained orthodoxy.

95
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,370
But a lot of that has changed now.

96
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,940
I've noticed, I began to notice it really
in 2014 thereabouts.

97
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,400
What it is clear is that people on both sides
of the aisle,

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,260
Democrats and Republicans increasingly believe
that

99
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,270
the US China relationship is out of whack,

100
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,650
and that it was serving one country's interest
more than the other.

101
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,210
So there's been a sea change.

102
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,400
I know you've argued that the US and Taiwan

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,020
should have a free trade agreement.

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,670
What would that be?

105
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,670
Absolutely.

106
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,670
Yeah.

107
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,680
Well, my argument is based on the fact

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,970
if you look at all of the 20 free trade agreements

109
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,870
that the United States has had

110
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,060
or just call it a trade agreement,

111
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,780
all of them,

112
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,710
I would say the principal motive for most
of them

113
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,090
was political and strategic and for a few
others

114
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,990
there was also particularly the case of NAFTA

115
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,280
because Mexico and Canada are our neighbors,

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,190
they're not hostile neighbors.

117
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,220
I'm not convinced about Canada.

118
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,870
Please carry on.

119
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:56,330
But the idea was that we could,

120
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,310
we had interests in strengthening these countries.

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,750
The very first free trade agreement was with
Israel

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,870
and that wasn't for economic reasons.

123
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,920
And then what followed were with moderate
Arab States,

124
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,920
which were basically more friendly toward
Israel, l

125
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,090
ike Morocco and Jordan and Oman.

126
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,850
And then we did Central American States,

127
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,020
not because they were economically important,

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,040
but because we hoped that would help stabilize
their economies

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,900
and would cut down illegal immigration.

130
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,060
And I suppose maybe drugs, I don't know about
that.

131
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,690
With Chile and Peru in large part

132
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,490
was because they were moving towards more
of capitalist systems

133
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,220
in their governments.

134
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,840
So what would a free trade agreement with
the US and Taiwan do?

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,100
The main importance of it would be strategic
as a sign of US endorsement

136
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,620
and support for Taiwan because Taiwan is kind
of lonely out here

137
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,931
and it would encourage other countries who
have been,

138
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:07,030
a relatively positive view toward Taiwan like
Japan

139
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,830
to think about trying harder to create free
trade agreements

140
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,910
because the ultimate goal would be,

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,570
and it's already happening as a result of
the trade war

142
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,520
between the United States and China,

143
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,530
is that increasingly Taiwan doesn't want to
be

144
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:30,160
so economically dependent on China, on PRC.

145
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,479
And so it would serve that purpose.

146
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,060
It would make Taiwan,

147
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,409
I think more attractive partner for other
countries

148
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,250
and it'd be a way of showing our support.

149
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,349
I mean, after all,

150
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,959
it's a country of 23 million people that's
a democracy

151
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,079
and friendly to us.

152
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,389
Now we don't give them any aid.

153
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,430
But let's remember that it's over $3 billion
last time I checked,

154
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,910
I thought it was $3.5 billion in aid we give
to Israel.

155
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,029
Why do we do that?

156
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,999
Well, there are historical reasons,

157
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,860
but basically also we consider it a democracy

158
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,370
that's friendly to the United States.

159
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,470
So if we're doing it for Israel,

160
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,660
why shouldn't we be more helpful to Taiwan?

161
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,480
And I'm not saying give them money necessarily,

162
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,139
but at least do a free trade agreement with
them

163
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,260
and lower the cost of their exports.

164
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,019
And we, they're already our 11th largest trading
partner.

165
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,579
So it's a significant country.

166
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,029
Well, I'm curious, besides a free trade agreement,

167
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,750
what more could the US do to support Taiwan?

168
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,240
Well, we've done some of it already.

169
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,759
Under the current administration,

170
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,459
we've been selling more arms that they've
asked for.

171
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,610
We should, I think there's a lot more interaction

172
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,699
between our militaries than is apparent,

173
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,610
but we should increase it if we're going to
invite the Chinese

174
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,110
who have been declared a strategic competitor,

175
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,019
which is a nice way of saying,

176
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,389
not very friendly or worse, why don't we invite
Taiwan?

177
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,529
Now possibly what would happen is other countries
would say,

178
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:08,589
well we can't participate

179
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:11,790
because it'll hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people.

180
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,670
But in that case we can have our own exercise
with Taiwan.

181
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,730
We should be doing that.

182
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,860
It'd be very useful in the event of some natural
disaster out here

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,199
that we participate in if we've got a record
of participating.

184
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:34,170
I think we should consider,

185
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:43,089
I hope we are more of the latest technology
are for weapons systems.

186
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:49,149
We should be, we already have joint training
in some areas.

187
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,050
I think that should be increased.

188
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,290
I would like to see some Pentagon officials
openly come here.

189
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,009
High level.

190
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,899
There are other things we could do.

191
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,889
I mean, we should speak out more strongly
about Taiwan.

192
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,939
Every time that the PRC objects to something

193
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:18,350
with regard to Taiwan for example,

194
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,709
are the fact that Pompeo congratulated Tsai
Ing-wen,

195
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,540
our Secretary of State congratulated Taiwan's
newly elected,

196
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,860
again elected president.

197
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,180
Chinese complained about it.

198
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,439
I would like to see the press person get out
there

199
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:36,339
and speak more strongly about that stuff.

200
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,920
When Wang Yi, the Foreign Minister of Hong
Kong

201
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,620
makes a statement that we have to sever the
black hands

202
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,610
who are interfering in Hong Kong affairs

203
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,560
and then takes a swipe at the US for what
it's been doing.

204
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,829
We should say this is nonsense,

205
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:03,189
and it's not the kind of language that civilized
countries use,

206
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,910
is particularly unfortunate at a time

207
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,459
when there's so much Chinese PRC espionage

208
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,550
going on in inside the United States.

209
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,230
We shouldn't let them get away with that kind
of rhetoric used against us

210
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,819
and we just supine and we take it.

211
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,129
We've been doing that for far too many years
and we should talk back.

212
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,839
Well, how do you think the Trump administration
has been handling Taiwan?

213
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,389
Well, clearly in a much better fashion in
many ways.

214
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,759
But, I'm troubled by what,

215
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,079
I don't know what Trump really thinks about
Taiwan.

216
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,529
I know he received the phone call initially,

217
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,980
which I gather his staff advised him to do
from Tsai Ing-wen.

218
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,369
It was a nice gesture.

219
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:55,050
But for example, we know he then later went
to Mar-a-Lago

220
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,850
and he met with Xi Jinping

221
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,839
and he talked about how Xi Jinping

222
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,709
had explained to him in just two minutes,

223
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:09,649
the whole history of Korea and how Korea had
always been part of China.

224
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,560
And I thought to myself, well that's interesting.

225
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm sure the Koreans are going to be unhappy.

226
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,670
And they were.

227
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,720
But I thought to myself,

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,100
surely they didn't meet for all that length
of time in Mar-a-Lago

229
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,259
and he talked about Korean history as part
of China

230
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:28,040
and he didn't talk about Taiwan.

231
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,319
And subsequently we've heard on one occasion
there's,

232
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,399
I don't remember the exact phrase,

233
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,629
but they were suddenly implying that

234
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,309
perhaps Taiwan could be a bargaining chip,

235
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,800
everything was negotiable.

236
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,529
Something along those lines.

237
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,529
The people who've stood up most strongly

238
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,529
have been people like Randy Schriver,

239
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,839
Department of Defense has now left,

240
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,949
Peter Navarro who's on the trade negotiating
team,

241
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:59,269
Matt Pottinger in the NSC.

242
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,410
John Bolton, who's now left the government

243
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,240
who's always been very strongly supportive,

244
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,360
so that gave a certain complexion.

245
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,889
I think Secretary Pompeo,

246
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:15,410
I think his own views also are very supportive
of Taiwan.

247
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,560
But, it's been intermittent and I guess maybe
the president

248
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,399
said something after the election just now
of Tsai Ing-wen,

249
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,850
but he should do more.

250
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,769
But I guess he's so worried about getting
a trade deal.

251
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,410
But my own view has always been that I don't
think we're ever

252
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,370
going to get from the PRC the kind of trade
deal we want and need:

253
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,730
protection of intellectual property,

254
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,980
ending subsidies to state owned enterprises.

255
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,559
And so I don't think, frankly,

256
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,660
my own view is that trade is all that with
China,

257
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,899
PRC is all that important.

258
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,440
United States, if you look at the list of
countries

259
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,249
least dependent on exports of goods and services,

260
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,209
US is one of the least dependent countries,

261
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,230
or the least top, the lowest 10.

262
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,889
So I know that Chinese communist party

263
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,959
has threatened military action against Taiwan.

264
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,980
If it actually came to that, what would the
US do?

265
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,610
Well, I'm always asked that and, who knows.

266
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,319
I mean really, but my answer is we could no
longer be the United States

267
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,810
if we didn't step in and defend Taiwan.

268
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:41,989
I mean, God knows we've fought wars in the
name of democracy

269
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:46,040
and fighting off communism in Vietnam.

270
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,670
We went into Iraq because they had weapons
of mass destruction

271
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,350
and they didn't.

272
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,350
And by the way,

273
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,399
people in that I knew in the state department

274
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,279
who were following arms said that was the
case,

275
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,700
we went into, we stayed in Afghanistan to
this day.

276
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,559
And it's still a hodgepodge.

277
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,980
And that was one of the motives

278
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,370
was also against ISIS,

279
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,850
but we've been involved in Syria.

280
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:19,360
So if we can get involved in these kinds of
conflicts

281
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,930
we certainly ought to support Taiwan.

282
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,930
So otherwise we stop being the United States.

283
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,550
That means we don't stand for principle.

284
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,790
We just look after our own interests.

285
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,459
And, as I once said to an Australian scholar

286
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:43,679
who is brushing off on the importance of Taiwan,

287
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,850
I said, well I can think of another country

288
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,949
that it's a democracy with only about 23 million
people

289
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,889
that we could brush off too.

290
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,119
That would of course be Australia,

291
00:16:56,119 --> 00:17:00,119
but we firmly consider them an ally.

292
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,669
So, but even more important perhaps for some
people if,

293
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,500
you don't care that much about principles

294
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,959
or the nature of the United States,

295
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,939
it's geo strategically important.

296
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,110
One of the reasons China wants it is because
then

297
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,300
they put military bases on Taiwan

298
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,689
and they extend their reach into the Western
Pacific

299
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,480
and they rupture the first island chain of
defense

300
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,100
that General MacArthur famously talked about.

301
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,230
So the other thing is, what are our allies?

302
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,990
What is Japan going to think?

303
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,440
What is Singapore going to think?

304
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,970
Recently Indonesia and Malaysia in various
ways

305
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,110
have always both expressed unhappiness with
the Nine-Dash Line

306
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,260
are we just going to turn it all over

307
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,070
once they control the South China Sea and,

308
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,450
or if they control it and if they control
Taiwan,

309
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,970
basically Japan and South Korea our allies
and friends

310
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:12,340
are isolated and China calls the shots or
PRC calls the shots.

311
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,429
So, is it possible then for the US to normalize
relations with Taiwan,

312
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,140
just treat it like any other country?

313
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,059
Like what would China actually do?

314
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,679
Well, I'd like to see that they come.

315
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:29,269
I think there were mistakes way back

316
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,899
during the time of Chiang Kai-shek

317
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,280
where Taiwan could have remained in the UN.

318
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,309
That might've been changed by PRC eventually,

319
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,710
but there could have also been,

320
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,159
there were discussions of dual recognition
that was a possibility,

321
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,100
so I think we've dropped the ball in the past.

322
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,290
Whether we could pick it up in the future
I don't know.

323
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,320
I'd like to see that they come because in
my view,

324
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,360
Taiwan is clearly a country.

325
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,970
It's a sovereign state, it's independent,

326
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,909
they have elections and it's a democracy.

327
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:07,840
But, I understand those who argue that

328
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,799
we don't want to necessarily do anything

329
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,940
that's going to provoke a conflict.

330
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,970
What I always say is anything we do with regard
to Taiwan

331
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,140
that might lead to threats to Taiwan there
were already enough threats.

332
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,450
We should always consult very closely with
Taiwan

333
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,529
because they're in the best position to judge
what is safe,

334
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,120
what is doable.

335
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,730
They have a better eye out in reading of what
might happen.

336
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,140
It sometimes worries me for example,

337
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,620
I have, some of my friends are big independence
advocates,

338
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,980
but that's all because they feel sure

339
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,010
that the US will come in and save the day.

340
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,170
But, one of the factors I think everybody
realistically

341
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:02,539
has to recognize is that PRC today is much
stronger militarily.

342
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:09,110
And, it could be a very risky confrontation,

343
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,360
not only for us but also for the PRC.

344
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,700
I mean, we're not pushovers for sure.

345
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,929
I know you've called Taiwan a modern miracle.

346
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,110
What does that mean?

347
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,590
All that it's accomplished in 40 years.

348
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,450
The miracle that in about less than four decades
really,

349
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,630
it went from poverty to prosperity

350
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,820
and it went from military dictatorship to
democracy.

351
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,029
And it's a model of democracy in Asia now

352
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,539
and from many other parts of the world and
it's done all of that.

353
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,390
The real miracle is it's everything

354
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,649
it's done it's done without really any natural
resources

355
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:55,360
except the skills, the hard work, the education
of its people.

356
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,490
It didn't start off like the United States
with the great river system,

357
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,950
the largest plots of fertile land in the world,

358
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,020
and, with immigrants who could make America
great

359
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,480
because we would bring in skills as we needed
them.

360
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,200
They basically got a little bit of help from
the United States

361
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,490
and from others, from missionaries, and people
came in the beginning.

362
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,880
But by and large,

363
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,330
it's been on its own and it's been politically
isolated since 1972

364
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,880
and yet they've accomplished all this.

365
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,520
That's a miracle, I think.

366
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Wonderful.

367
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,710
Thank you so much for joining me.

368
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,740
My pleasure.
