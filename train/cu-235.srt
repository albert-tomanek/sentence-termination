00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,520
China will do anything to "meat" market demand.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Including...

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,599
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
If you're like me,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,240
you want answers to the questions that matter
most.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,330
"Where's the beef?"

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,430
Where's the beef indeed.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,430
If you answered,

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,430
"On a farm,"

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,150
haha, that's so cute.

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,020
No, the beef is in Tianjin, China,

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,390
where the world's largest animal cloning facility
is under construction.

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,590
Chinese genetics company BoyaLife wants to
be the first to take animal cloning to an

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,390
industrial scale.

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,870
BoyaLife's 31 million dollar cloning plant
will go into production in 2016.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,059
It will start by producing 100,000 cloned
cows per year,

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:58,460
eventually reaching one million.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,379
Holy Cow!

21
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,210
Their goal is to provide 5 percent of the
meat eaten in China.

22
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,000
You know, the meat that's not rat meat falsely
labeled as lamb.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,650
Mmm, my mouth is already watering.

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,729
So how does this cloning work?

25
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,650
"A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building
a living thing."

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,350
Actually in that case I believe it worked
like this.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,900
But here's a better explanation.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:32,820
"Cloning is where you take all of the genetic
contents from one cell and move them somewhere

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,509
else and reproduce them."

30
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,400
Helping BoyaLife is a joint venture partner:

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,360
South Korean company Sooam Biotech.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,270
It's run by a man once known as the "king
of cloning"

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,810
until he was fired from the Seoul National
University for

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,220
"research fraud and

35
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,780
gross ethical lapses in the way he obtained
human eggs for his experiments."

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,740
So this new Chinese cloning plant is in good
hands.

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,719
As for practical concerns like

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,170
how will they manage to feed so many cattle?

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,530
and what will the environmental impact be?

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,789
Well, that was somehow left out of the BoyaLife
press release.

41
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,940
Also left out of the press release: all the
ethical concerns.

42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,290
Cloned animal meat is a hugely controversial
topic in many countries.

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,750
A topic BoyaLife dismissed with a single vague
sentence.

44
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,670
In Europe, it's illegal to sell cloned meat.

45
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,629
Parliament voted to ban it because of human
health and animal welfare concerns.

46
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:36,590
Which is why people freaked out when a lamb
crossed with a jellyfish was sold for meat

47
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,760
in Paris.

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,180
What's the big deal?

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,590
It's like lamb with mint jelly, but all in
one.

50
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,660
Now the long-term health affects of eating
cloned meat are unknown,

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,640
though there is some evidence that cloned
animals may die earlier.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,519
In the US, the FDA says cloning can improve
the quality of animals and approved cloned

53
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,500
meat for human consumption.

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,120
No special labeling is required.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,769
So are you already eating cloned meat if you
live in the US?

56
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,459
Well, since no special labeling is required
for cloned meat,

57
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,849
how would you know?

58
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,610
But according to the Guardian, most cloned
animals are used for breeding,

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,400
not for food.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,940
Is there such debate in China?

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,440
Well, the Chinese people might have concerns,

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,900
but who cares?

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,760
The government gave it thumbs up,

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,349
so no debate.

65
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,400
And why worry?

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,379
BoyaLifeâ€™s chief executive said cloned beef
is

67
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,840
"the tastiest beef I've had."

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,830
And I'm sure he's totally unbiased.

69
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,129
The US doesn't import beef from China.

70
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,560
But that's because of concerns over quality.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,640
But as BoyaLife's chief executive said,

72
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,760
"We are going [down] a path that no one has
ever traveled."

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,739
And I'm sure everything will work out just
fine,

74
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,540
like it always does in China.

75
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,870
But for now, I think I'll stick to a burger
made in the traditional way

76
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,700
by grinding together 1,000 cows from five
different countries.

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm sorry!

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm lovin' it!

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,090
So would you eat cloned beef?

80
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me know what you think in the comment
section below.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:45,090
And please like this video and subscribe to

82
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:53,970
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
