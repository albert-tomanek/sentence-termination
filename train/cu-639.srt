1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,880
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,140
Vice President Pence has a few words for China.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,400
Ok, 4,000 words.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,310
Have you heard about Google’s China scandal?

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,210
Then maybe you should Google it.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,900
And finally, you can’t spell patriotism

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,110
without approval from the Party.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,820
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,380
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,300
Last week,

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,840
Vice President Mike Pence gave China a real
pounding.

13
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,380
In a 40-minute speech at the Hudson Institute,

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,600
a prominent conservative think tank in Washington,
DC,

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,530
Vice President Pence laid out the case

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,700
against the Chinese Communist Party.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,020
America had hoped that economic liberalization

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,010
would bring China into greater partnership

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,600
with us and with the world.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,750
Instead, China has chosen economic aggression,

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,280
which has in turn emboldened its growing military.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,750
I would play the entire 40-minute speech,

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,070
but instead let me summarize it in 30 seconds.

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,420
Pence talked about some issues that might
sound familiar.

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,940
Like intellectual property theft,

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,280
trade violations, military aggression—

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,930
basically it came off like

28
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,190
a 40 minute episode of China Uncensored.

29
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,320
But with less jokes.

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,640
What’s that Shelley?

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,300
Ok fine, with fewer jokes.

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,800
See?

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,340
We’re hilarious.

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,400
Pence also said the Chinese regime is trying
to

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,440
undermine democracy in the United States.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,460
Worst of all, China has initiated an unprecedented
effort

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,680
to influence American public opinion,

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,860
the 2018 elections,

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,220
and the environment leading into

40
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,420
the 2020 presidential elections…

41
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,610
Now that’s something President Trump

42
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,570
also said at the UN Security Council.

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,229
If you haven’t been paying attention,

44
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,360
some of Pence’s speech might seem a little
exaggerated.

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,329
The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding

46
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,200
or coercing American businesses,

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,720
movie studios, universities, think tanks,

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,890
scholars, journalists, and local, state, and
federal officials.

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,840
I mean, that is a lot of people to reward
or coerce.

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,979
But as the Wall Street Journal puts it,

51
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,700
“This isn’t a casual accusation.

52
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
For months,

53
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,200
a team of national-security officials has
been compiling

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,250
a study on the many ways China uses money,

55
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,569
power and rewards to affect the way it is
viewed in the US.”

56
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:23,980
As I’m sure you can imagine,

57
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,150
the Chinese Communist Party was not happy
about

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,900
Pence spreading all these malicious rumors

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,230
to undermine China’s harmonious society.

60
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,240
Which is why state-run Xinhua ran this article
called,

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,950
“Not-so-Bright Rumor-Spreading:

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,209
a Critique of U.S. Leader Using Absurd Arguments
to Defame China.”

63
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,940
And Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua
Chunying said,

64
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,650
“This is nothing but hearsay evidence,

65
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,090
confusing right and wrong and creating something
out of thin air.”

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,100
Thin air?

67
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,209
Then I’m a magician,

68
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,180
because I’ve made six years worth of YouTube
videos

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,940
out of this stuff.

70
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,780
Of course, who knows what the future

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,330
of China Uncensored is on YouTube?

72
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,330
Because there’s more unsettling news

73
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,790
out about YouTube’s owner Google—

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,940
and its relationship with the Chinese Communist
Party.

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,360
At the beginning of August,

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,740
a Google insider leaked a secret project Google

77
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,770
was working on called Dragonfly.

78
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,020
It’s a search engine that would censor all
the things

79
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,700
the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t want
people to know about.

80
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,360
Pence even mentioned it in his speech.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,750
For example,

82
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,970
Google should immediately end development
of the “Dragonfly” app

83
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,019
that will strengthen Communist Party censorship

84
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,480
and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers…

85
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,299
Google has not publicly responded to questions
about Dragonfly.

86
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,209
The closest thing we got to a response

87
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,879
was Head of Google’s search Ben Gomes telling
the BBC,

88
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,769
“Right now all we’ve done is some exploration,

89
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,189
but since we don't have any plans to launch
something

90
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,409
there’s nothing much I can say about it.”

91
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,140
I mean, they don’t have any plans to launch
something so...

92
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,510
wait, what’s this?

93
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,000
Gomes wants to launch Dragonfly “as soon
as possible”?

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,610
And get it “brought off the shelf and quickly
deployed”?

95
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,799
That’s from a leaked transcript

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
where Gomes told Google employees

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
the exact opposite of what he later told the
BBC.

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,560
Now I’m not saying that Google would do

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,690
anything it takes to get into the China market.

100
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,530
Would they censor their search engine?

101
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,940
Who knows?

102
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,680
Even a top Google executive can’t seem to
figure out

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
whether the Chinese Communist Party censors
its citizens.

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,030
This Wednesday was National Day in Taiwan.

105
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,680
It celebrates the founding of the Republic
of China,

106
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,340
aka, the government of China that now occupies
Taiwan.

107
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,210
And what better way to celebrate...

108
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,330
than with a military drill!

109
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,940
They called it a quote “simulated invasion
by opposing force.”

110
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,090
No particular opposing force, though.

111
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,090
I mean, it could be the People’s Liberation
Army—

112
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,330
which has vowed to conquer Taiwan.

113
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,280
Or it could be aliens.

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,110
I mean really, either is possible.

115
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,110
By the way,

116
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,500
Pence also talked about Taiwan.

117
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,400
America will always believe Taiwan’s embrace
of democracy

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,150
shows a better path for all the Chinese people.

119
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,990
C’mon, Mr. Vice President!

120
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,220
Is there even anything left for me to talk
about?

121
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,930
Let’s see here...

122
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,990
Ah, Hong Kong.

123
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,400
You didn’t talk about Hong Kong!

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
And the good news is...

125
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,389
there’s bad news from Hong Kong.

126
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,910
It looks like Victor Mallet,

127
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,830
the Asia news editor for the Financial Times
as well as

128
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,449
the Vice President of Hong Kong’s Foreign
Correspondents Club,

129
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,010
had his media visa for Hong Kong cancelled.

130
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,010
Why?

131
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,979
Well, no official reason.

132
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,870
The Chinese Communist Party has promised

133
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,310
to honor the one country two systems policy,

134
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,139
where Hong Kong gets to keep freedoms

135
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,820
the rest of China never had.

136
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,850
And the Communist Party would never not honor
its promises.

137
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,150
But the mysterious decision to reject Victor
Mallet visa

138
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,880
did happen just weeks after the Foreign Correspondents
Club

139
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,660
hosted a talk by a Hong Kong activist Beijing
really doesn’t like.

140
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,410
The Chinese regime has denied visas

141
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,700
to several journalists in mainland China

142
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,250
over the last few years.

143
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,220
But this is the first time it’s happened
in Hong Kong.

144
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,570
Could this be yet another sign of the Chinese
Communist Party’s

145
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,919
increasing erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms?

146
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,550
I’m sure everything is fine.

147
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,820
And in this lovely article from the Financial
Times,

148
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,440
I learned the Trump administration

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,630
won’t talk trade with China at the G20.

150
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,720
...unless Beijing makes a list of concessions
first.

151
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,850
And since the IMF says the trade war

152
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,760
is going to hit China harder than the US,

153
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,960
the Chinese regime might not have much of
a choice

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,150
but to make some concessions.

155
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,639
Not that they won’t drag this out as long
as possible.

156
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,800
And finally, Qin An,

157
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,479
the director of the China Institute of Cyberspace
Strategy,

158
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,889
has finally released a hit new single

159
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,740
about China’s cyberspace strategy!

160
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,259
I know, you’ve all been dying to hear it
it.

161
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,760
It’s creatively called “Cyberspace Strategy
Song.”

162
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,940
Let’s have a listen!

163
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,960
A new territory for national governance?

164
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Cyberspace:

165
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,930
It’s been Chinese territory since ancient
times.

166
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,360
The song was written for the 2018 China Cybersecurity
Week.

167
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,410
Where China will send a panda into orbit!

168
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,270
OK, sometimes I don’t fact check.

169
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,449
I just believe what’s in my heart.

170
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,770
And this is not even the first

171
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,460
Chinese propaganda song about Cyberspace.

172
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,309
In 2015,

173
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,400
the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commision

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,660
had this song,

175
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,240
"The Mind and Spirit of Cyberspace Security."

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,830
The director of the the Central Cyberspace
Affairs Commision

177
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,560
is Xi Jinping,

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,711
who is also the chair of

179
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,690
the Central Military Commission.

180
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,490
So hopefully the military and the cyberspace
commission

181
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,259
can work together more.

182
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,370
Because cyberspace is a dangerous place.

183
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,370
So what do you think?

184
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,630
Leave your comments below.

185
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,630
And before you go,

186
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,490
now is the time when I answer questions from
you—

187
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,289
the loyal members of the China Uncensored
50-Cent Army

188
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:28,000
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,570
Damian Shale asks,

190
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,760
“Chris, how did Matt, Shelley and you meet?

191
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,950
Also , when did you guys get the idea for
making the show?”

192
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,729
Well, I met Shelley when I was working

193
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,060
in Langley, Virginia on a farm.

194
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,740
She had been sent to...

195
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,850
help me buy the farm...

196
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,030
but I charmed her out of it.

197
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,320
Eventually, we teamed up and went rogue.

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,380
Kind of an A-Team situation,

199
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,990
helping people in need.

200
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,720
There was this one family in Guatemala

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,730
we rescued from being killed by narco traffickers.

202
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,410
The family couldn’t afford to pay us, though,

203
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,120
so they gave us Matt.

204
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,700
But Matt made the team a little too...

205
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,660
unwieldy to be an elite rescue squad,

206
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,420
so we naturally fell back on the next best
thing:

207
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,269
a China themed YouTube channel.

208
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,940
And the rest is history.

209
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,310
We’re thinking of optioning the movie rights
to Hollywood.

210
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,790
Thanks for you question.

211
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,060
And do you have a question you want to ask
me?

212
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,410
