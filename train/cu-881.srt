00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,870
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,379
If you stare into the void long enough,

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,419
the void…

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,679
eventually gets a little creeped out.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,830
Since the dawn of time, Man has sought to
create.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,060
To invent.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,859
To drive humanity forward.

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,699
But I’ll bet when our ancestors created
the wheel...

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,789
The guy in the next village saw it and created
this for half the price.

11
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,280
Yes, bootlegging.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,960
The world’s second-oldest profession.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,880
Wait a minute…

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,320
actually let's not think about that too much.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,620
Anyway, you may say bootlegging is shameful
and illegal,

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,790
but you got to admit,

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,100
it can sometimes be hilarious!

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,250
So behold!

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,650
All of civilization has led to these 10 Chinese
toy knockoffs.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,930
Number 10 New Style Ninja Tortoise

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,580
This isn't some lame old turtle!

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,490
You can tell by its chest.

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,140
Besides, turtles live in the water.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,080
A tortoise lives on land.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,500
So this knockoff actually makes more sense
than the original.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,899
Seriously, Donatello; why would you need a
submarine?

27
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,780
Number 9 Mighty Car

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,939
An ordinary person might see Mr. T and the
van from the A-Team

29
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,640
But the clever mind of the bootlegger sees
so much more.

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,109
He sees Mr. T

31
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,670
as the van!

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,920
With a machine gun and axe!

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,429
No one’s gonna give this guy any jibber
jabber!

34
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,280
Number 8 Pokyman

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,859
No, not Pokemon. Pokyman.

36
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,130
Get out of here Pikachu.

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,460
I choose you,

38
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,149
Rastafarian Pikachu!

39
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,139
Number 7 Batman

40
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,909
If this is not a pipe,

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,389
then this is not Superman.

42
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,520
And besides, everyone knows Superman/BATMAN
doesn't use guns.

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,939
Number 6 Fun Neddy Lovely

44
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,319
My Little Pony may believe that Friendship
Is Magic,

45
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,319
but you do not want to know what DEMON DONKEY
believes in.

46
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,440
And his requests to TYE ME!!! best go unheeded.

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,410
Number 5 Harry Potter Obama Sonic

48
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm sorry, did that not make sense?

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,860
How about now.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah, still doesn't make sense does it?

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,830
Number 4 Mouse and Friends

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,560
(crying) Whyyyyyy?!

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,480
Number 3 Robert Cop

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,170
The future of law enforcement is here!

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,640
No one fights crime like...

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,250
Robert Cop!

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,860
But before you dismiss Robert as a worthless,
half-melted knockoff of RoboCop,

58
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,240
let's consider what he has going for him.

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Besides stealing the Terminator's tagline.

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,670
He's a:

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,970
-Futuristic Robert

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,900
-Terminator (autobotic)

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
-exciting movie look

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,120
and he's also a toy.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,430
Number 2 The Titanic

66
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,050
Don't let this Titanic toy fool you.

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,820
It's more than meets the eye.

68
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,150
This Titanic would probably have been able
to avoid the iceberg.

69
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,420
Though I bet all the people would have still
died horrible deaths during the transformation.

70
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,990
And Number 1 Sense of Right Alliance

71
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,010
Who needs the Justice League,

72
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,350
when you have the much more communist-sounding
Sense of Right Alliance!

73
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,060
It's got all your favorite heroes:

74
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,850
A Power Ranger.

75
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,710
Batman!

76
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,160
Other Batman!

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,310
Spiderman.

78
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,460
Shrek!

79
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,090
You know, you really shouldn’t mix universes
this way.

80
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,740
Well those are my top 10 favorite Chinese
toy knockoffs.

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,690
But there were so, so many more to choose
from!

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,400
What’s your favorite Chinese toy knockoff?

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,510

84
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,930

to ChinaUncensored@gmail.com.

85
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,870
If there’s enough interest, I’ll do a
fan favorites version of Chinese toy knockoffs.

86
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,000
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see 
you next time.
