1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,680
what’s five times the price of a cargo ship

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,070
and not quite as good?

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,280
Why, it’s China’s freight train to Europe!

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,740
All aboard for OBOR!

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,560
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,040
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,580
Well, chalk another one up for

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,410
China’s central planning masterminds.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,030
They’ve built a network of railways

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,000
to connect exporters in China

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,530
with markets in Europe.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,040
And vice versa.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Sort of.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,800
It’s called the New Eurasian Land Bridge
––

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,620
or NELB, for short.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,530
It’s a terrible acronym

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,589
for an impressive-looking set of rail lines.

19
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,039
They run some seven and a half thousand miles

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,690
across Eurasia,

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,589
stretching from eastern China to western Europe.

22
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:51,769
How does it work, you ask?

23
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,269
Let’s take a look at this helpful cartoon

24
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,690
from state-run China Daily.

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,760
“I’m a bottle of British whiskey,

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,780
heading to China by China Railway Express.

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,089
See you on board.”

28
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,520
“What a journey to Yiwu.

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,480
18 days and 7500 miles.”

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,540
But for this British whiskey bottle,

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,410
it’s also a journey of the heart.

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,820
But how does Ms. Vitamin

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,430
feel about Mr. Whiskey?

34
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,050
“And, of course,

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,170
now we’ve run into each other.”

36
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,920
“I’m just glad we’re making a contribution

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,240
to the country’s economic growth.”

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,040
How patriotic.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,300
But what is that economic contribution exactly?

40
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,660
Well, the New Eurasian Land Bridge

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,750
should have been called

42
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,210
the Freight Line Overland Path instead.

43
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,910
Because from an economic standpoint,

44
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,540
it’s a FLOP.

45
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,500
Sorry, Ms. Vitamin.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,160
One big reason is small capacity.

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,030
A freight train can only carry

48
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,280
a fraction of the cargo of a container ship.

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,480
According to Forbes,

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,330
the total capacity of the NELB over an entire
year

51
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,330
represents at best just four days’ business

52
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,440
for the Port of Shanghai.

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,590
So if you plan to transport large amounts
of stuff,

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,530
boats can’t be beat.

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,730
Shipping is also cheaper.

56
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,200
Much cheaper.

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,060
Rail freight on the NELB costs up to

58
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,910
five times as much as sea transportation.

59
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,230
Plus, rail’s got another snag—

60
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,360
the freight cars have no heating or air conditioning.

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,590
Some of the train lines cut across parts of
Russia.

62
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,900
So for example,

63
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,560
Spanish olive oil producers selling to China

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,000
need to wrap the bottles in blankets

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,370
to keep them from freezing and exploding.

66
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,120
Local wildlife would be devastated

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,560
if there was an olive oil spill.

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,940
Of course, for the locals,

69
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,640
it means pre-marinated chicken.

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,060
So if the cartoon we watched earlier was accurate,

71
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,450
Mr. Whiskey would be looking on in horror

72
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,410
as all of his friends froze to death.

73
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,060
But even when temperature-sensitive goods

74
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,620
are bundled in blankets,

75
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,300
for some products rail is still

76
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,570
only an option in spring and fall,

77
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,960
when the weather’s mild.

78
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,270
That’s why Spanish food and beverage producers

79
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,160
are saying thanks but no thanks to the NELB.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,540
Chinese oil importers could always try local
sources.

81
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,980
“Cooking oil in China is recycled from the
gutters.”

82
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,420
On second thought,

83
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,660
they should just bring in the olive oil on
ships.

84
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,920
Fans of the Eurasian rail link point out

85
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,400
that rail is twice as fast as sea,

86
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,580
and half the price of air.

87
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,530
Well, it is definitely faster than a cargo
ship.

88
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,480
But as far as being cheaper than flying...

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,470
The wildly exaggerated claim

90
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,050
made by my favorite Chinese state-run media

91
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,690
the Global Times, says freight train cargo

92
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,320
“costs one fifth the price of sending goods
by air.”

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,300
But the Global Times also says

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,950
China is a champion of human rights...

95
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,300
so let’s just take that with a cargo container
of salt.

96
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,170
According to a professor at the University
of Sydney,

97
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,280
it could end up costing just as much

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,970
to send your cargo container

99
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,190
on an 18-day trek on the FLOP train,

100
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,930
as it would on a one-day jaunt

101
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,709
in a climate-controlled airplane.

102
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,400
And that’s because “Chinese subsidies
for the NELB

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,980
are rumoured to be as high as 50%.”

104
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,180
That means the price being charged right now

105
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,370
doesn’t reflect the real economic cost.

106
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,070
And while Mr. Whiskey’s journey makes it
seem l

107
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,500
ike most of the goods on the railway

108
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,170
are being transported from Europe

109
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,490
to Chinese markets,

110
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,600
that’s not really what’s happening.

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,660
A little over a year after

112
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,760
the Madrid-Yiwu Express started running, 3

113
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,340
9 trains had gone from China to Spain,

114
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,860
but only 8 trains returned to China

115
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,590
with Spanish exports.

116
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,770
And so it’s not surprising that

117
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,419
Tom Holland from the South China Morning Post

118
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,220
says that “Compared to sea or air,

119
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,090
the Europe-China freight service

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,610
just makes no economic or environmental sense,

121
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,860
either coming or going.”

122
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,840
But if the numbers don’t add up, then why
do it?

123
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,580
The New Eurasian Land Bridge is a core part
of

124
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,100
Xi Jinping’s One Belt One Road initiative.

125
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,760
He plugged it hard in front of 29 heads of
state in Beijing,

126
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,540
during last year’s “Belt and Road Forum”––

127
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,410
or BARF.

128
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,580
One Belt One Road, or OBOR,

129
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,050
is about building huge infrastructure projects

130
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,229
around the world––

131
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,100
like seaports, bridges, tunnels and train
lines.

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,410
It’s supposed to make China look like

133
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,949
a benevolent and cooperative rising power

134
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,040
that uses its own cash to create jobs

135
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,810
and increase trade in other countries.

136
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,150
But it’s also about projecting soft power

137
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,650
and giving China more leverage

138
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,970
in future negotiations.

139
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,500
As well as finding more markets

140
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,240
for Chinese exports.

141
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,360
And like I said last week

142
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,430
in our episode about the 16+1 countries,

143
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,840
China’s got an increasing interest in Europe.

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,949
Which means projects that make no economic
sense,

145
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,100
turn out to be an investment worth making.

146
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,200
Oh, and what happened with

147
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,560
Mr. Whiskey and Ms. Vitamin?

148
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,780
They lived happily ever after,

149
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,080
in the kind of store that stocks their alcohol

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,880
right next to their medications.

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
So what do you think about

152
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,100
the New Eurasian Land Bridge?
