00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,409
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:04,100
China's stock markets crash.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,560
And the world trembles.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,200
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,210
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,109
Last week, China's stock markets tumbled.

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,410
But not to worry!

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,750
By the end of the first day,

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,060
the government's automatic circuit breakers
kicked in to halt trading.

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,840
These circuit breakers were put in place as
a last resort.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,960
So it's maybe not a good sign that they were
triggered twice in one week.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,319
Once on Monday the 4th,

13
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,609
and again on that Thursday

14
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:37,519
when the stocks fell so much so fast that
within 30 minutes,

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:42,159
the circuit breakers kicked in and stopped
trading for the entire rest of the day.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Chinese markets had already fallen a shocking
11.6% since Monday's open.

17
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,350
"The government put in place so-called circuit
breakers.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,760
But when those circuit breakers were triggered
last week,

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,370
people were afraid they wouldn't be able to
sell later on.

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,299
They sold more,

21
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,239
and that shut down trading altogether."

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,339
What he means is the circuit breakers actually
made investors panic more.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
So then authorities got rid of the circuit
breakers

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,280
the very thing that was supposed to make the
markets more stable.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,290
Oh, and the rest of the world panicked, too.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,690
During China's terrible stock market week,

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,180
the U.S. Dow Jones and the S&P 500 indices
both fell about 5%.

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,840
London's FTSE All-World Index that covers
47 countries fell 6.1%

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,780
which is the worst weekly fall in that index's
history.

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,130
Now some of the global markets are back up
a bit since then,

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,650
but there's still a fundamental problem:

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,900
China's stock markets are crazy volatile,

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,910
and its huge swings can send shockwaves

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,260
--good or bad--

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,470
through the rest of the world's markets.

36
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,620
Over the past few years,

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,010
China's financial system has been integrated
more and more into the global economy.

38
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,710
Like with allowing foreigners to buy Chinese
stocks.

39
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,070
Or the IMF adding China's yuan to its basket
of important currencies.

40
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,720
And there's merit to this,

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,850
since China has the world's second largest
economy.

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,070
But the Chinese Communist-run government,

43
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,860
on the other hand, well...

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,110
they're a force to reckoned with.

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,609
"What I think the whole episode has shown,

46
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,999
and the volatility in particular that we have
seen,

47
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:17,049
is that the Chinese authorities are perhaps
not in charge of what's going on in the markets.

48
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,950
Yeah, Chinese authorities aren't supposed
to have that much control!

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,710
Most foreign analysts say China should aim
to let stocks take their course based on the

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,780
actual market conditions and the economy.

51
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,389
That's the healthiest thing in the long-run.

52
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:35,829
Chinese authorities artificially boosting
the stock markets last year is what got people

53
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,980
into this mess in the first place.

54
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,040
But authorities don't want to let go,

55
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,049
because they're concerned about the impact
that a bad stock market

56
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,469
or worse, a slumping economy overall

57
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,010
could have on social unrest.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,480
For example, there were 1,300 strikes and
labor protests in China in 2015.

59
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,049
That's a lot,

60
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,310
and it's twice as many as the year before.

61
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,620
And social unrest could threaten the people
in power.

62
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,329
Of course, in China, the stock market doesn't
really affect the larger economy.

63
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,079
They're not the same thing.

64
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,510
But whether it's a slumping stock market or
a slumping economy,

65
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,209
when Chinese people feel insecure about their
financial future,

66
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,219
they're more likely to be upset with the ruling
Communist Party.

67
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:19,889
"How come our Chinese markets have become
like this?

68
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,459
What's the Communist Party done?

69
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,989
Even if they want to rob money,

70
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,739
they shouldn't be robbing money from our elderly
people!"

71
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,510
Yeah! They should be robbing money from someone
else! Jeez.

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,129
Anyway, China's stock market is extremely
volatile.

73
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,809
And authorities don't seem to have the proper
tools to smooth it out.

74
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,669
So what will happen?

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,080
China's stock market may recover a bit,

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,930
then go back down, then up, then down again.

77
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,279
We don't know by how much.

78
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,840
But one thing's for sure:

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,169
Whether you're in the US, Europe, or Asia,

80
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:54,510
your stock markets are going to be affected
too, 'cause...

82
