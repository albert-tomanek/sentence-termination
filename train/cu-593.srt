1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,020
our robot future is coming...

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,220
made in China!

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,000
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,179
Robots.

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,080
Humans have been obsessed with them...

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,660
well, forever.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,820
The ancient Greek god Hephaestus built automatons.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,040
And in China,

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,250
King Mu in the 10th century BC

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,610
met an “artificer” who gifted him a life-size

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,380
mechanical man that could sing,

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,609
dance, and apparently flirt.

15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,989
Both true stories.

16
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,379
And two thousand years later,

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,539
China is back at it again.

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,050
According to this report submitted to the
US-China

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,760
Economic and Security Review Commission,

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,950
China has been rapidly developing its robotics—

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,839
for both commercial and military use.

22
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:55,501
So China has rolled out with some

23
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,739
pretty impressive robots.

24
00:00:57,739 --> 00:00:59,180
Like these ones,

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,370
which hold the Guinness Book of World records

26
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,660
for the most robots dancing simultaneously.

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,640
If that looks scary to you,

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,210
you ain’t seen nothing yet.

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,860
Here are 5 scary Chinese robots of the future.

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,220
Number 5

31
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,210
Chinese RoboCop

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,220
For those of you who aren’t regular watchers

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,570
of China Uncensored,

34
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,700
Robert Cop is my favorite

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,520
Chinese knockoff toy.

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,720
The Furniture of Law enforcement.

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,630
And E-Patrol Robot Sheriff is the real-life

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,090
Chinese knockoff of RoboCop—

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,310
at least in terms of being a cop.

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,800
It’s in use at a train station in Zhengzhou
city.

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,650
It looks more like a cross between HAL and
a Dalek.

42
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,130
It can use facial recognition technology

43
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,730
to somehow identify “potential criminals
or suspicious people.”

44
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,690
It also loves children.

45
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,730
Until it crushes their puny bodies.

46
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,550
I think I’ll be avoiding that train station.

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,590
Number 4

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,590
Tell me your secrets.

49
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,730
I’ll tell you mine.

50
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,130
This is Aelos.

51
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,890
It can dance, recognize different languages,

52
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,220
tell you about the weather, news and traffic,

53
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,780
or even listen to your secrets.

54
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,000
“Owner, you can tell me all of your secrets.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,120
I won’t tell anybody.”

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,350
I hope the Chinese government

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,340
isn’t good at hacking!

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,620
And of course,

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,960
it knows how to fight.

60
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,080
Why are we fighting each other?

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
We should fight the humans!

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Agreed!

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,020
After we play soccer.

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,800
Number 3

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,870
Fire-shooting drone

66
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,120
Nothing says “safety” like eight spinning
blades

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,540
and a flame thrower.

68
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,260
It’s actually designed to help utility workers

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,430
clean trash off of power lines.

70
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,730
Somehow, without burning

71
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,270
the power lines themselves.

72
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,700
Trash can cause outages or electrical shorts.

73
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,900
So, yeah,

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,650
this drone is technically for safety.

75
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,280
But I can also see it being repurposed

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,610
from some extremely not-safe purposes,

77
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,590
like if they pared it with E-Patrol Robot
Sheriff

78
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,830
to fight crime.

79
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,830
Number 2

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,870
Nightmare quadruped.

81
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,290
Horizon Zero Dawn is a video game

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,099
set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun

83
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,920
by animalistic machines.

84
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,020
And I think it’s safe to say

85
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,069
we know where this story begins.

86
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,390
This four-legged robot was debuted at a competition
in China

87
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,750
to display unmanned robotic designs

88
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,660
that can traverse uneven terrain.

89
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,520
This makes them useful for counter terrorism
operations,

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,470
like bomb disposal and reconnaissance.

91
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,260
But, I guess if you saw one of these coming,

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,940
you’d know something was up.

93
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,670
And finally, Number 1

94
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,370
The Uncanny Valley

95
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,820
Can man make machine in his image?

96
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,680
The upcoming movie, Ghost in the Shell

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,379
explores the boundaries between man and machine

98
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,490
with this poorly designed Japanese robot.

99
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,360
I mean, she doesn’t look Japanese at all!

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,910
But in the present day,

101
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,570
meet what’s being called the most human-like
robot.

102
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,820
And it’s still totally creepy.

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,069
And not just because its creator

104
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,380
has programed it to call him “My lord.”

105
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,520
“Don't come too close to me

106
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,590
when you are taking a picture.

107
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,010
‘It will make my face look fat.’”

108
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,010
Oh good!

109
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,160
They build the robot with the same kind of

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,380
deep-seated insecurities

111
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,910
that make humans act irrational.

112
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,090
I think I’ll take Scarlett Johansson instead.

113
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,880
So those are 5 scary Chinese robots.

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,830
Who knows where the future will lead?

115
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,280
Let’s just hope that as

116
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
artificial intelligence develops,

117
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,130
they don’t learn from us puny humans.

118
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,190
We can be kind of horrible sometimes.

119
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,210
So which Chinese robot

120
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,600
was your favorite?

121
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,950
And what’s your plan to survive

122
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,870
the inevitable robot revolution?

123
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,240
Leave your ideas below.

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,280
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

125
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

126
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,500
See you next time.
