1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
Danger in the South China Sea

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,400
China pushes for more nukes

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,400
And China censors Friends

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,800
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,000
Anyway, the South China Sea\h
dispute heats up this week.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,960
On Monday, 16 Chinese warplanes\h
breached Malaysian air space.\h\h

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
Malaysia released these\h
photos of the Chinese planes.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Malaysia scrambled jets to\h
intercept the Chinese aircraft.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,680
And is now summoning a Chinese\h
envoy for a dressing down.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
The Chinese embassy denied any wrongdoing. “The\h
planes conducted routine flight training and\h\h

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
‘strictly abided by’ international law without\h
violating airspace of other countries.”

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,760
Wait, are they saying they didn’t violate\h
the airspace of other countries...because\h\h

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Malaysia has been part of\h
China since ancient times?

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
But it’s not just Malaysia having\h
problems. Indonesia announced it’s\h\h

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,840
expanding its submarine fleet in response to\h
China’s aggression in the South China Sea.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
Indonesia is expanding its sub fleet from 4 to 12,\h\h

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,440
“in response to the Chinese communist regime’s\h
repeated incursion into the disputed waters”.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,120
It comes shortly after Indonesia’s\h
fifth submarine sank in April.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
And the Philippines lodged a\h
formal diplomatic protest to\h\h

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
China’s illegal presence in the South China Sea.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,320
The complaint is over “incessant\h
deployment, prolonged presence,\h\h

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,120
and illegal activities of Chinese\h
maritime assets and fishing vessels”.

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,960
It comes as China stationed its maritime militia\h
ships just off an Island in the Spratlys this\h\h

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,880
week. The island is occupied by the Philippines.
It’s about 300 miles from the Philippine mainland.\h

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
On top of that, earlier this year,\h\h

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
China sent hundreds of its maritime\h
militia ships to Whitsun Reef,\h\h

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,360
which is also part of the Spratlys and within the\h
Philippines’ 200-mile exclusive economic zone.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
But really, why is everyone so afraid\h
of the Chinese Communist Party?\h\h

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
Is it the military aggression? It’s\h
the military aggression, isn’t it?

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,560
Well, that’s why Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h
is calling for a more lovable image of China.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Xi told state-run Xinhua, “It is necessary to\h
make friends, unite and win over the majority,\h\h

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,480
and constantly expand the circle of friends\h
[when it comes to] international public opinion.”

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,520
This might look like warm and fuzzy\h
language--China wants to be loveable!\h\h

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:10,080
It needs to expand its circle of friends! But\h
it’s not. Because the whole point of Xi’s speech\h\h

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
was that the Chinese regime needed to\h
do better at “public opinion struggle.”

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,240
“In such a struggle, there are friends in\h
the form of compliant media and apologists,\h\h

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,400
and there are enemies in the\h
form of recalcitrant journalists,\h\h

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,240
academics and politicians who insist\h
on criticism—exactly what this external\h\h

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,520
push is designed to neutralize.”
And nothing says “let's be friends”\h\h

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,680
quite like a targeted propaganda\h
campaign aimed at silencing criticism!

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,400
The Chinese regime will “strengthen propaganda\h
efforts to help foreigners understand the Chinese\h\h

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Communist Party and the way it ‘strives\h
for the happiness of the Chinese people.’”

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,640
Now you might be thinking, China is a country\h
that uses gang rape as a form of torture.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,600
How are they striving for the\h
happiness of the Chinese people?

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
Well think about it—how much\h
better will the rest of your day\h\h

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,760
seem compared to the gang rape?! Apocalyptic\h
pollution is nothing compared to that!

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Wow, I want to be friends with China already!

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,200
But if Xi Jinping really wants to present a\h
lovable image of China, I suggest he start\h\h

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,160
comparing himself to one of the most lovable\h
characters of all time: Winnie-the-Pooh!

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,920
Of course if friendship doesn’t work,\h
my favorite Chinese state-run media,\h\h

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,280
the Global Times, says China needs more\h
nukes. You know, for threatening the US.\h

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,600
The editorial came out just hours after U.S.\h
Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Chinese\h\h

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Vice Premier Liu He held an online meeting.
I think the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t\h\h

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,240
like Tai. Earlier in May, she said in a\h
Congressional hearing, “If China cannot or\h\h

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,480
will not adapt to international rules and norms,\h
we must be bold and creative in taking steps\h\h

60
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,960
to level the playing field and enhance\h
our own capabilities and partnerships.”

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Bold and creative. Well, China’s answer\h
to “bold and creative” is more nukes.

62
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
But maybe I’m being unfair. It’s possible\h
that the Global Times article had nothing\h\h

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,800
to do with the trade meeting. Because\h
it also came out after the US started\h\h

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,640
pushing for more investigations into\h
the origin of the coronavirus outbreak.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,600
But you know, speaking of my favorite\h
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times,\h\h

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
I can’t help but think about the Washington Post.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic,\h
The Washington Post was very critical of anyone\h\h

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,000
pushing the absolutely insane conspiracy theory\h
that the coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab.

69
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,760
Here’s a headline from February 2020,\h
Republican Senator Tom Cotton keeps\h\h

70
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,000
repeating a coronavirus conspiracy\h
theory that was already debunked

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, this week they quietly changed that headline\h\h

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,120
to Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus\h
fringe theory that scientists have disputed.

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,920
How about that?

74
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,240
It comes as the Washington Post has recently been\h\h

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
forced to admit the lab leak\h
theory is actually credible.

76
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,520
You know, journalists should own up to\h
their mistakes. What’s that Shelley? Oh,\h\h

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,160
it seems I made a mistake. And I’ll own up to it.\h\h

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,800
I said the original headline was from\h
2020. I was wrong. It’s from 1984.

79
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
But if you love disturbing coverups,\h
stick around after the break.

80
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,800
Welcome back.

81
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,600
If you’re feeling nostalgic for the\h
early days of the coronavirus pandemic,\h\h

82
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,640
China is reporting the very first case\h
of a human getting a new bird flu.

83
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,680
Don’t worry, the Chinese government says\h
the risk of large-scale spread is low.\h\h

84
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
And when have they ever lied?

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,120
Speaking of people without a clue, Tesla\h
is setting up a data center in China.\h\h

86
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,080
All Chinese user data will be easily\h
accessible by the Chinese government.

87
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
And after Tesla did the unethical thing the\h
Chinese Communist Party wanted them to do,\h\h

88
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
the Party screwed Tesla anyway.

89
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
I feel like there’s a lesson here somewhere.

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,040
But speaking of crackdowns, Hong Kong.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
Today is June 4. It’s the anniversary\h
of when the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

92
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,240
sent their army to crush student\h
protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,160
And every year since then, Hong Kongers have\h
held a candlelight vigil in Victoria Park,\h\h

94
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,480
to commemorate the thousands of victims.

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,000
But now that the Chinese government has\h
passed its Hong Kong National Security Law,\h\h

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
it looks like they won’t be\h
permitting these vigils ever again.

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
You know, because of health and safety reasons.

98
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
This year, it’s because of the coronavirus.

99
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,200
Next year, who knows? Maybe\h
we’ll have a new bird flu?

100
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
It’s such a dangerous safety issue,\h\h

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
that anyone who attends can be thrown\h
in prison for up to five years.

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,200
And to make sure that no one dangerously\h
gathered in large groups in public,\h\h

103
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,520
the Hong Kong police mobilized 7000\h
officers to patrol the streets.

104
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
Looking for people who were wearing black,\h
chanting slogans, or holding candles.\h

105
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
You can always spot a dangerous\h
criminal by the candle they’re holding.\h

106
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Speaking of dangerous Hong\h
Kong criminals, Grandma Wong.\h

107
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
She’s an elderly Hong Kong democracy protester.

108
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,240
When we were there in 2019, we\h
saw her at all the big protests.

109
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
But now, she’s been arrested for\h
commemorating the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,560
Obviously, her protest was\h
a health and safety risk.\h\h

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
Even though...she was the only one at her protest.

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,560
But look, arresting this elderly woman was for\h
her own good. I would never question my government\h\h

113
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
if they tell me they have to take away\h
my liberty for everyone else’s safety.

114
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,800
Also for safety issues, two days\h
ago authorities from the “Food\h\h

115
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,160
and Environmental Hygiene Department” shut\h
down Hong Kong’s Tiananmen Square museum.\h\h

116
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,840
It was for illegally operating a\h
“place of public entertainment.”

117
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,320
You’ve got to protect people’s safety!

118
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,400
And speaking of catastrophic assaults\h
on human dignity—the Friends Reunion.\h

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
Apparently that was a big deal to some people.\h\h

120
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
But if you were watching it in China,\h
you saw something a little different.\h\h

121
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,800
Because the cameos by Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber,\h
and Korean boy band BTS were all censored.

122
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,280
That’s right, they’re all banned in China,\h
so those bits got cut in the mainland.\h\h

123
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,400
But since the Friends Reunion was\h
unwatchable, I’m not sure anyone noticed.

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,800
And this episode is sponsored\h
by PC-Doctor Toolbox.

125
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,720
Computer and software crashes, hardware\h
failures, and general computer slowdowns are\h\h

126
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,000
a more common occurrence than\h
we all like to admit. And these\h\h

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
issues can come up during the worst\h
times—like during a business meeting,\h\h

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
or when you're traveling away from home,\h
and your trusted IT person isn’t around.
