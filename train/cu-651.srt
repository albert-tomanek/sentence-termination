1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,420
China’s economy is slowing down.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,420
What does this mean for China’s future?

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,540
This is China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,669
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,429
It looks like China’s economic miracle...

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,800
may be slowing...way...down.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,380
Even China’s official GDP figures

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,880
confirm the situation is bleak.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,080
On Monday, Chinese Officials released data

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,770
for the fourth quarter of 2018.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,570
They claimed GDP growth was just 6.4%.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,030
That’s the lowest reported figure in 28
years.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,060
And that’s the *reported* figure.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,760
It’s been clear for a long time that Chinese
GDP data

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,080
is basically man-made.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,850
China’s current premier Li Keqiang admitted
that,

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,920
way back in 2007.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,020
He didn’t say it publicly,

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,579
but, you know, Wikileaks.

20
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,440
At any rate, things aren’t looking good
in China right now.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,210
“The numbers show exports fell the most
in two years last month,

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,370
with demand in most of its major markets weakening.

23
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,620
Imports also saw a shock drop,

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,390
falling over seven percent in their biggest
decline since 2016

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,960
with Chinese consumers holding back on buying

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,250
everything from iPhones to cars.”

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,630
Although, to be fair, the new iPhone

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,160
is just a more expensive version of the old
iPhone.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,280
And who wants to buy a car

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,260
when Chinese traffic jams look like this?

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,970
Even I’ve never seen 30 lanes of stopped
traffic before,

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,150
and I’m from LA.

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,189
Anyway, across China,

34
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,680
factories are cutting prices and laying off
workers.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,290
Especially factories whose products

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,409
are directly affected by US tariffs.

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,840
Foreign direct investment is also taking a
beating.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,830
Companies are getting more hesitant about
doing business in China.

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,630
“That is more because it is becoming

40
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,369
increasingly complicated to do business there,

41
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,240
with the forced technology transfer,

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,990
with the lack of transparency,

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,690
discrimination as compared to Chinese companies,

44
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,670
with the massive subsidies of state-owned
companies.”

45
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,970
The big question is,

46
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,680
will what happens in China stay in China?

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,739
Or will the slowdown spill over

48
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,099
and become a global problem?

49
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,460
Well, the World Bank released its economic
report this month and...

50
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,430
... It’s called “Darkening Skies”?!

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,680
It’s not a good sign when your economic
report

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,930
sounds like the name of a new show

53
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,880
from the makers of Stranger Things.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,629
But ok, “Darkening Skies” says, spoiler
alert,

55
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,630
that the slowdown in China

56
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,680
means more risk of a global slowdown.

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,780
The good news—at least for America—is,

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,480
since China doesn’t import a lot of manufactured
goods,

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
the impact on workers in the United States

60
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
will be pretty limited.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,489
But developing countries that export

62
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,379
raw materials like iron ore

63
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,860
could be in for a bumpy ride.

64
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,849
The Chinese authorities are already taking
action

65
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,730
to lessen the potential blow to their own
economy.

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,190
They’ve slashed the bank reserve requirement
ratio.

67
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,280
That’s the amount of money that banks

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,739
are required to physically keep.

69
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,860
Lowering the ratio frees up more money,

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,150
which in theory will push banks to lend that
money,

71
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,209
which spurs business growth.

72
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,599
The problem with that, though,

73
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,370
is that it fuels growth by creating more debt.

74
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,959
And China already has 34 trillion dollars

75
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,220
of public and private debt.

76
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,780
A sort of “Debt Bomb” if you will.

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,750
In fact, China’s debt problem

78
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,780
has “been called a mountain,

79
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,900
a horror movie,

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
a bomb

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,940
and a treadmill to hell.”

82
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,890
Of course, Treadmill to Hell

83
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,810
is also the name of AC/DC’s little-known
workout album,

84
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,230
which includes such hits as

85
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,330
“You Shook My Shake Weight All Night Long”

86
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,300
and “Back in Black Yoga Pants.”

87
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,830
But anyway, so far,

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,769
Chinese officials’ solution to the economic
growth problem

89
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,799
is to make the debt problem bigger.

90
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,129
That doesn’t sound great.

91
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,900
Well, I suppose they could reduce their debt

92
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,830
by creating inflation...

93
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,300
but I don’t think they want to be like Venezuela,

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,299
where people have to go shopping

95
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,450
with massive piles of bills.

96
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,489
Actually, the craziest thing about China’s
slowing economy

97
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,379
isn’t that there is ballooning debt,

98
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,190
or a manufacturing slowdown,

99
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,520
or risky government stimulus.

100
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,949
The craziest thing is that no one quite knows

101
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,919
how much China’s economy is really slowing
down.

102
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,439
Yeah, everyone knows China’s GDP numbers
are inflated,

103
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,069
but no one knows how much they’re inflated.

104
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,529
Maybe the top leadership gets “real” data
from somewhere,

105
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,340
but even that is unlikely,

106
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,729
since lower-level officials are highly incentivized

107
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,009
to report “better” numbers up the chain,

108
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,960
so they don’t get in trouble.

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,930
And sure, officials can look at other data

110
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,249
to make an educated guess.

111
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,979
Like Li Keqiang looked at “electricity consumption,

112
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,919
rail cargo volume, and bank lending.”

113
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,740
But that’s not ideal.

114
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,189
And if officials don’t know how much the
economy is slowing,

115
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:01,240
well, it makes fixing the problem that much
harder.

116
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,949
So what’s your proposal to fix China’s
slowing economy?

117
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,689
Leave your comments below.

118
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:07,689
And before we go,

119
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,719
it’s time to pull out the ol’ hat

120
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,969
and answer a question from a fan

121
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,220
who supports China Uncensored

122
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,099
with a dollar or more per episode

123
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,029
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

124
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:22,979
Jordan Laramore asks:
“China officially has like 9 political parties

125
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,669
but they vote in line with the CCP,

126
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,580
what are the chances that one day

127
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,279
they decide to form an opposition party?”

128
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,279
Well, Jordan,

129
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,880
it’s interesting you should mention the
political parties.

130
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,949
A lot of people think the People’s Republic
of China

131
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,600
is a one-party state.

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,330
But they’d like you to know,

133
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,970
that couldn’t be further from the truth!

134
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,400
China has 8 other political parties.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,619
A lot of them even have “democratic” in
their names!

136
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:48,710
If you say it over and over,

137
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,050
it must be true.

138
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,680
Just like the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea.

139
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,650
There’s just one small catch.

140
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,419
Those 8 political parties

141
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,969
are directly controlled by the Communist Party.

142
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,449
It’s literally written into the constitution

143
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,110
that the multi-party system

144
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,819
is officially under the Communist Party’s
leadership.

145
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:12,249
After all, it’s the “People’s Democratic
Dictatorship.”

146
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,949
These 8 other parties combined make up

147
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,449
less than 30% of the votes in the National
People’s Congress.

148
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,649
So if they wanted to form a bloc and vote
a different way,

149
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,780
they couldn’t pass any laws.

150
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,979
Not because of the lack of votes though.

151
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,669
Because the National People’s Congress

152
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,539
has no real power.

153
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,460
Its job is to give the appearance of law

154
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,330
to a country where policy

155
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,300
is actually decided by the Communist Party.

156
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,330
So if the other parties did try to oppose
it,

157
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,409
the Communist Party would just declare them

158
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,809
illegal organizations and crush them.

159
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:47,389
Not that they ever would try to oppose the
Communist Party,

160
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,300
since all 8 parties are also directly controlled

161
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,159
by the Communist Party’s United Front organization.

162
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,139
So the chance that these 8 parties

163
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,789
would one day decide to form an opposition
party...

164
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,229
is zero.

165
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,610
There have been people in China

166
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,550
who have tried to start real opposition parties,

167
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,149
that aren’t controlled by the Communist
Party.

168
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,669
Let’s just say, it hasn’t ended well for
them.

169
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,990
Thanks for your question, Jordan.

170
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,520
