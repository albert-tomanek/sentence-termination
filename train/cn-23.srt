00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,660
[Laughter]
Listen...

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,920
Tom, when you're drinking that water,

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,940
you're drinking the water of every bit of water that water's ever been with.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,340
MATT: Away from the laptop, Tom.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,540
[Breathes]

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,560
Hurrah!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,960
That was close!

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,240
I was nearly...!

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,880
Oookay.

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,240
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,640
That'd be more like a gigantic Versailles fountain as he just spat back and â€” whoosh!

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,080
Erm...

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,940
Yes. [Clears throat]

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,740
He provound... He founded\hthe Inst...

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,260
Hold up! Hold up! We've got a gusher!

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,180
