1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,259
Hong Kong protesters are organized.

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,610
Theyâ€™re strategic.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,300
And they mean business

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,860
What tactics does a modern protest movement
use?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,640
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,020
I'm Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,490
Joining me today is Hong Kong activist

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,970
and board member of Amnesty International,
Hong Kong,

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,380
Johnson Yeung. J

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,150
ohnson, thank you for joining me today.

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,150
Thank you.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,210
So I've noticed that the Hong Kong protests

13
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,190
have focused a lot on nonviolent tactics.

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,190
Why is that?

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,920
Well, first of all, Hong Kong people are quite
peaceful

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,050
and also nonviolent tactics can help us to
galvanize

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,829
international solidarity and support.

18
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,350
We want to show that Hong Kong people has
exhaust

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,710
every means that we can under the rule of
law

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,410
to fight for democracies and human rights.

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,530
But it's quite obvious,

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,630
after three months of peaceful protest after
one million,

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,620
two million people took to street,

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,770
the Hong Kong government is still not compromising

25
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,509
and not making any concession and this [inaudible]

26
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:11,429
a lot of hatred and also anger from their
population.

27
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,630
And most importantly,

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,380
the police brutality that targets peaceful
protesters

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,659
has worsen the situation that a lot of people
now believe

30
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,810
that fighting back is the only options.

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,729
So do you think nonviolent tactics can work?

32
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,509
Because it sounds like what you're saying
is they haven't.

33
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,649
No, I think nonviolent tactics

34
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:36,999
is really depending on the context.

35
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,729
I still believe that nonviolent tactics

36
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,289
will be useful to galvanize popular support

37
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,579
and also galvanize international support.

38
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,060
But keep in mind that right now,

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,989
according to a lot of public survey,

40
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,509
actually more than 75% of the Hong Kong people

41
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,119
are approving the movement.

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,619
So we have already achieved the goal

43
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,069
of galvanizing public support and we have...

44
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,270
So right now,

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,009
I do think that in order to keep people on
the street,

46
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,269
in order to keep pressures over the government,

47
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:18,329
then at least the protestors have to defend
themselves

48
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,239
with minimum of force.

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,689
Now I don't think anyone from the protestors'
side

50
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:26,629
would want to use force,

51
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,739
but it's quite obvious that if the police

52
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,989
was just tear gas or use baton to hit on protestors,

53
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,730
there's no way the protestor to use shield

54
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,030
or to use wooden plank to protect themselves

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,099
from the beatings of the batons.

56
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,350
Well, in a leaderless protest like this,

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,159
how do you enforce nonviolent tactics?

58
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,629
I mean, I have seen more than a few Molotov
cocktails

59
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,920
thrown throughout the course of this.

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,159
So I will call it as a leader-full movement,

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,980
because I can see there are actually a lot
of leaders

62
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,540
who is running different frontal tactics.

63
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,200
There are people who is working on

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,950
the international advocacy fund.

65
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,640
There are people who are gathering suppliers

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,860
that can provide supplies to the protestors.

67
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,879
So I think this is like a leader-full movement

68
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
rather than a leaderless movement.

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,150
Now the principles or the,

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,060
you can say the culture of the movement

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,840
was built within movement.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,640
So back to June, there are people who suggest
principles like,

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,659
we are not going to separate the moderate
side

74
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,139
or the radical side of the protesters.

75
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,670
We are going to protect each other.

76
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,110
We need to prevent shedding blood on both
sides.

77
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,110
So these principles are in general agreed
by the protestors.

78
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,310
Now, in every movement,

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,329
there are of course radical flank of people,

80
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,079
but even people are throwing Molotov cocktails

81
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,659
or fighting back to the police,

82
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,730
there are people who suggest that

83
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,609
we shouldn't beat people indiscriminately

84
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,170
and these are the set of principles

85
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,180
that are agreed by most of the protesters.

86
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,719
And also, the way, since there is no leading
network

87
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,449
or leading protestor activist who is calling
the shot,

88
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,860
so most of the disciplines are enforced

89
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,250
by the protestors who are on site.

90
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,680
So there are of course some scene

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,650
which some protestor overreact,

92
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,280
but the other protestor will try to calm them
down

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,060
and deescalate the situation.

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,599
So this other mechanism that is enforced individually

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,789
but not by hierarchies of organization.

96
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,729
And to my observation,

97
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,240
the movement is a 100% largely nonviolent.

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,289
Most of the disciplines are still maintained.

99
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,681
And the force that is used by the protestor

100
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:01,340
are way lower than the level of force

101
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,980
that is used by the police or state hired
thugs.

102
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,389
I've noticed that humor and art

103
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,560
has been a big part of the protest.

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,669
What does that do?

105
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,250
Humor and art,

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,180
it's really useful to maintain the momentum

107
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,910
and also the morale of the protesters.

108
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,919
Imagine that for three months,

109
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,840
people are living in a very intense period.

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,710
For people who are not even protestors,

111
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,259
they are under threat of arbitrary arrest

112
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,509
or intimidations by police.

113
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,590
So having people who are is playing music,

114
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,830
who is dancing crazily,

115
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,260
who is using those laser pen to a point at
some buildings,

116
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,520
that is kind of the humor that people need

117
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,580
because it helps to ease the very intense
moment

118
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,259
and it keeps people to continue

119
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,870
with their participation in the movement.

120
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,410
So that's the first benefit of

121
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,849
having humor within the movement.

122
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,900
Secondly, humor also, you can say,

123
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,310
disarm the terrors of the government.

124
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,190
So for example,

125
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,860
the government were trying to outlaw the laser
pen

126
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,360
by claiming laser pen is a weapon

127
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,759
and they did arrest people for possessing
these pen.

128
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,759
So the other night,

129
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,500
when the police arrest someone

130
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,889
who is possessing a laser pen,

131
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,940
people buy a thousand more laser pen

132
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,650
and they had a music show with laser pen pointing
everywhere.

133
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,960
So this disarm the government terror

134
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,539
and it sent a very clear message saying

135
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,850
"We are not afraid of your arbitrary arrest."

136
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,850
And since then,

137
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,599
the government are reducing their numbers
of arrests

138
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,169
for people who are possessing the laser pen.

139
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,940
So that's one example of how we can disarm
the terror.

140
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
We just passed the fifth anniversary

141
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
of the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

142
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
What have protestors from this movement

143
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
learned from the Umbrella Movement?

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
One of the reason why the Umbrella Movement

145
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,930
failed in achieving substantial achievement

146
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,840
is because we are heavily reliant on

147
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,090
tactics of concentrations,

148
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,370
meaning people occupying roads near to

149
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,379
the government headquarter for 79 days.

150
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,449
In the first two weeks of the Umbrella Movement,
i

151
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,620
t was quite effective because the government

152
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,970
didn't experience that mass numbers of people

153
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,670
occupying main roads.

154
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,720
But two weeks after,

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,810
the government started to adapt these tactics

156
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,020
and they know how to plan for a counter mobilization

157
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,500
and also counter tactics,

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:43,280
which is to delay negotiations and wait things
out.

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,740
People learned from this experience

160
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,349
that they are going to use more tactics of
dispersions,

161
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,950
meaning they are dispersing protests in different
areas

162
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,939
using guerrilla protests in different area.

163
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,360
And it's very helpful in two sense.

164
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,580
One, the police face larger barriers in arresting

165
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,150
and rounding up protesters.

166
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,270
And second, we bring police brutality

167
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,969
and we bring the two colors of the police

168
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,050
in front of different neighborhoods.

169
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,650
So there are a lot of people

170
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,210
who are not in the protestors' side,

171
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,610
but when the police brutality,

172
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,659
when the police is arresting people in different
neighborhoods,

173
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,270
people know the true natures of the regime

174
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,520
and they become hardcore supporters of the
movement.

175
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,870
So it was really helpful for us to galvanize
popular support.

176
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,740
And when residents in different neighborhood,

177
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,980
they were just having dinners

178
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,960
and get stopped and searched by the police,

179
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,260
they will resonate the cause of the movement

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,650
which is having an independent inquiry over
police brutality.

181
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,310
So how do protestors learn about these tactics

182
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,200
and how do they organize them?

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,140
So you can say most of the tactical

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,080
or strategic discussions are done in Linden,

185
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,730
which is like an online forum.

186
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,200
People have a lot of discussions over

187
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,860
what kind of strategy is the most effective,

188
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,030
and the algorithms of this online forum,

189
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,870
it has the provisions of a like and dislike
button,

190
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,860
and the algorithm also set in a way

191
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,190
that the more popular thread it is,

192
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,190
the more visible the threads are.

193
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,810
So it become a de facto screening mechanism

194
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,660
that the most popular strategy will be seen

195
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,980
by most of the protestors.

196
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,880
Now we also have the Telegram channel

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,530
which will build on the foundation

198
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,700
of the strategic discussions of Linden,

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,140
the online forums,

200
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,230
and then they will disseminate

201
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,300
and coordinate tactics and actions

202
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,660
and implementing those actions through Telegram.

203
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,160
And then lastly,

204
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,231
people will post a lot of pictures of police
brutality,

205
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,900
but also the bright side of the movement,

206
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,970
like people helping each other,

207
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,450
and disseminate [inaudible] and message on
social media.

208
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,700
So it becomes a feedback loop

209
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,610
that help us to snowball the movement.

210
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,610
And that is the very reason why

211
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,560
the movement has become so huge.

212
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,020
Now I understand you were arrested during
a protest.

213
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,460
Can you tell us a bit about that?

214
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,330
So I was arrested late July.

215
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,960
I was in Central and arrested by an aggressive
police.

216
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,540
At that time, I didn't do anything.

217
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,820
I was sort of following the instructions of
the police

218
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,020
which is stepping back.

219
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,280
But still, the police arrest me for obstruction.

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,350
And when I was arrested,

221
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,910
I was punched by the police for several times.

222
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,530
Nothing serious compared to other protestors

223
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,270
who are beaten by batons and pepper sprayed.

224
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,570
And then I spent 47 hours under detention.

225
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,770
So during the detentions,

226
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,590
the police were violating of protocols.

227
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,590
So for example,

228
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,460
I request calling my lawyers and calling my
family members,

229
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,220
and the police delay it,

230
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,230
claiming that they have no capacity,

231
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,670
claiming that I need to wait because they
were so many people.

232
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,180
And also it's quite obvious the police

233
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,960
were trying to take away my phone

234
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,290
so they can check the content inside the phone.

235
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,840
And when, according to the procedures,

236
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,730
they should put it in a sealed evidence bag.

237
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,420
So no content,

238
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,660
no information inside the phone will be contaminated.

239
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,450
But when I request them to do so,

240
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,850
I was surrounded by several police officers,

241
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,010
intimidating me, threatening me,

242
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,420
threatening to knock me in a so-called air
con room.

243
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,820
And by air con room...

244
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,710
Well, the other police did to other protestors

245
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,350
was they have buckets of cold water,

246
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,680
pour it over the protesters,

247
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,690
and lock him up in a very cold room,

248
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,540
as a way to torture people.

249
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,970
That sounds more like torture than the rule
of law.

250
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,700
It's cruel treatment to detainees.

251
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,100
It's not the most serious torture compared
to like...

252
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,830
Amnesty international also did a report

253
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,550
on a torturing case under detention.

254
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,480
It interviewed more than 20 people,

255
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,100
over 85% of the detainees were hospitalized

256
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,490
because they were beaten when they were arrested

257
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,330
and they were also beaten under detention.

258
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,810
There are multiple report documenting fractures
of bones

259
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,640
or even broken bones because four police,

260
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,430
five police were locking the detainees in
the rooms

261
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,380
and then they beat him up.

262
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,950
So it has become a phenomenon that the police

263
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,480
would use cruel treatments on detainees.

264
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,340
So luckily in my case I did not experience
that,

265
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,260
and I think part of the reason

266
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,620
is because I know the procedures and the lawyers

267
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,280
also keep a close eyes on me.

268
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,710
But I was threatened verbally when I was detained.

269
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,630
So during those 47 hours of detention,

270
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,730
my house was also searched,

271
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,710
which is something that is uncommon

272
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,370
because I was arrested for a very mild crime.

273
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,920
But the police,

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,540
I think they tell lies to the judge

275
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,140
and claim I was involved in illegal assembly

276
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,830
and the judge signed a warrant for a house
search.

277
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,120
And what was your charge?

278
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,360
My charge was, I was arrested for obstruction,
o

279
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,180
bstructing a police officer.

280
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,860
But when the police apply for a search warrant,

281
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,150
they claim I was involved in illegal assembly

282
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,890
and that's the reason why the judge

283
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,980
signed the warrant to the police.

284
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,870
And I was arrested along with 48 people.

285
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,600
All of them got a house search

286
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,050
and they did a house search at 10:00 or even
midnight.

287
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,170
So it is an intimidation to not just the detainees

288
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,740
but also the family members of detainees.

289
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,070
So imagine that the detainees were handcuffed

290
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,540
and put a chain on him

291
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,420
and they were talking to their home

292
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,950
to do a house search.

293
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,480
So it is a humiliation,

294
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,030
it's an intimidation to family members.

295
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:54,160
That's how we were locked up in those 47 hours.

296
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,570
We were also detained in a car park turned
into...

297
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,260
So we were locked in a police station car
park

298
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,830
turned into a temporary detention center.

299
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,510
There is no good ventilation in there,

300
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,940
so it was really hot.

301
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,370
It was like 32 degrees Celsius

302
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,190
and there was no place for us to sleep.

303
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,590
So some people have to lie on the floor.

304
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,570
I also witness that some protestors

305
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,640
and detainees were beaten in the head

306
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,920
and they were bleeding,

307
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,680
and they were not allowed to send to the hospital

308
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,930
four hours or even five hours

309
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,810
after they were beaten by the police.

310
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,220
So it's evidently that the police deprived

311
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,670
the rights of medical assistance of detainee
as well.

312
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,230
And you said you received verbal threats.

313
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,480
What kind of threats?

314
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,000
So when I request the police to seal my phone

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,030
because I don't want them to take away my
phone

316
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,470
and contaminate it,

317
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,430
I was surrounded by several police officers,

318
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,340
they were yelling at me and one of the police
officer

319
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,330
took his torch light and point to my eyes.

320
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,570
So those are the kinds of verbal abuses I
experienced.

321
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,280
They also threatened me to lock me in a air
con room.

322
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,320
The threatened... They swear at me claiming
me as a fool.

323
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,410
So those are the verbal abuse I experienced
then.

324
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,750
What do you think is motivating police officers
to act,

325
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,170
to behave the way they behaved?

326
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,930
The police are generally hostile to the detainees

327
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,200
and also the protestors.

328
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,810
According to the procedure,

329
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,100
I was a suspect so they can go through the
procedures,

330
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,060
take a photo, get the evidence, that's all
right.

331
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,520
But it's quite obvious that the police officer

332
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,809
enjoy verbal abuse or even torturing detainees.

333
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,519
And I think there are several reasons why

334
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,579
it motivate a police to torture people.

335
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,559
First, there is no scrutiny.

336
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,259
Supervisor allows them to do so.

337
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,669
And second, they hate protesters

338
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:25,350
because protesters always confront the police.

339
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,610
Because the protesters,

340
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,409
they want to express their anger to the government.

341
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,929
But the government officials were hiding behind
the police,

342
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,429
and that's why the police feel they are disrespect

343
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,210
and they want to retaliate on the protesters.

344
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,809
So where do you think the protest will go
from here?

345
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,240
So a lot of people seeing the October 1st
as end game

346
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,120
because it is the 70th anniversary of the
PRC.

347
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,019
But I think the protest wave would not go
away

348
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,980
and there are several reasons.

349
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,710
One, the government is not willing to make
any concessions.

350
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,380
Although Carrie Lam withdraw the controversial
extradition bill,

351
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,210
what we experienced in the past 120 days is
police brutality.

352
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,220
And we also experienced that the bad consequences

353
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,280
of lacking a checks and balance system.

354
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,370
It is the system that enable police

355
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,559
to beat people indiscriminately

356
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,270
and arrests people arbitrarily.

357
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,419
And what we want is a systematic change

358
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,230
because removing one bill is not going to

359
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,330
prevent further police brutality in the future.

360
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,929
So during the first dialogue of Carrie Lam

361
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,289
with some of the citizens,

362
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:58,990
she explicitly saying she cannot open

363
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,090
a independent inquiry over police brutality.

364
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,679
And without satisfying this demand,

365
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,820
that protest wave is not going away.

366
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,650
And secondly,

367
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,799
more than 75% of the population disapprove
the government.

368
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,340
Almost half of the population have zero trust
to the police

369
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,890
and also the government.

370
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,789
With such a contentious environment in Hong
Kong,

371
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,799
a lot of protest will happen

372
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,200
or will be triggers in the future.

373
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,330
So even the government would employ

374
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,450
massive arrests on protestors,

375
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,700
more will come.

376
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,529
But the sad part of things is,

377
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,409
I do believe that the Chinese government

378
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,669
is going to tighten the grips

379
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:55,559
over civil societies of Hong Kong

380
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,149
because they see Hong Kong as a threat to
the legitimacy

381
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,940
and also stability of mainland China.

382
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,340
So journalists will be intimidated,

383
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,590
critical scholars will be dismissed.

384
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,700
More corporation will be intimidated

385
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,409
and they will be forced and asked to dismiss
workers

386
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,879
who participate in strikes.

387
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:20,600
So in the short run,

388
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,460
the Hong Kong civil society will experience
a crack down.

389
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,240
But I guess in the long run, because so many
people

390
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,669
are not trusting the government

391
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,080
and so many people are angry to the government,

392
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,539
in the long run, the Hong Kong society will
continue

393
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,309
to fight against the Hong Kong government

394
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,630
and also the Chinese government.

395
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,270
So you think you'll succeed?

396
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,570
I think we will succeed in the long run.

397
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,759
But there are also several conditions.

398
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,720
First, the global international community

399
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,620
will have to stand up against the Chinese
government.

400
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,399
Second, we have to make more allies

401
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:00,260
to most of the liberal democracies

402
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,320
and also our neighborhood countries

403
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,809
because we are also under bullying of the
Chinese government.

404
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:07,809
And thirdly,

405
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,259
we need to preserve as many human resources
as we can.

406
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,190
We need to preserve as many activists as we
can.

407
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,600
That's why we need to build a very strong
support network,

408
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,909
lawyers network, and medical network

409
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:29,409
to support those who are under imminent threat
of the government.

410
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:32,760
If we succeed in maintaining this condition,

411
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,470
then I think we will win in the long run.

412
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,759
Because there are so many problems in China.

413
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,499
At this moment,

414
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,240
the state power of this authoritarian regime
is strong,

415
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,750
but it cannot maintain its state power forever.

416
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,740
There are so many internal contradictions
in mainland China,

417
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,179
society as well, like a widening wealth gap,

418
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,330
like the young people,

419
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,909
they also have a lot of grievances

420
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,899
because they cannot climb up to the social
ladders

421
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,529
and get a house for themselves.

422
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,019
So this kind of internal contradiction

423
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,100
would backfire to the Chinese government.

424
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,749
And if Hong Kong and also other international
community

425
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,080
manage to survive,

426
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,960
then there will be a lot of opportunities
for us to win.

427
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,399
So there's certainly a lot that

428
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,059
governments around the world can do,

429
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,159
but what can people watching this interview,

430
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,779
what can they do?

431
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,679
In the past few months,

432
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,860
Hong Kong movement strategy have been focusing

433
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,809
on galvanizing international support

434
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:44,889
and there are several ways that individuals
can help,

435
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,710
like passing legislations and policy in your
own government

436
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,919
to deter police violence.

437
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:51,919
So for example,

438
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,750
in the U.S. we have been trying to get

439
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,440
the Hong Kong human right and democracy acts
to pass

440
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,399
because it could deter police brutality by
threatening,

441
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:05,080
revoking the special trade status of Hong
Kong.

442
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,929
And also, the U.S. government

443
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,620
and also the EU or even Australia,

444
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,700
they can consider sanctions individual officers

445
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,279
or police commissioners who enable

446
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,049
police violence against peaceful citizens.

447
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,320
So as an individual,

448
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,499
you can call your representatives,

449
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,940
you can tell your representatives that

450
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,600
in order to not just help Hong Kong people,

451
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,580
in order to safeguard democracies

452
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,100
and the way of life of democratic institutions,

453
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,289
their governments should stand up

454
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:42,100
against the Chinese government

455
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,649
and Chinese authoritarian regimes.

456
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,369
So that's one way people can help.

457
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:51,830
Secondly, show solidarity to Hong Kong people

458
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,379
and also people who are oppressed by the Chinese
government

459
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,619
like Tibetans and Uyghurs,

460
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:02,490
because Hong Kong people morale will need
to be maintained

461
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,259
if we want to survive the long run oppressions.

462
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,860
So having foreigners,

463
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,070
having people from around the world

464
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,940
to share a news of Hong Kong,

465
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,999
to show up to protest,

466
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,509
it will help maintain our morale of the movement.

467
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:29,119
And enhance citizen to citizens exchange and
solidarity

468
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,749
is also very important

469
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,129
because what we are talking in here is

470
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,240
we need innovative way,

471
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,749
we need innovative tactics to continue our
struggle.

472
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,200
And in order to keep our mind fresh and innovated,

473
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,570
we have to learn from other country examples.

474
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,110
So having these kind of citizen to citizens
exchange

475
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:59,029
and solidarity will help us to keep our action
more diversified,

476
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:01,179
and that's the way that we can win.

477
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,960
Well thank you so much for joining me today.

478
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,880
Stay safe out there.

479
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Thank you.
