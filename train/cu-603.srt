1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,340
China makes demands on the US

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,860
Advertisers flee a pro-Beijing TV station

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,790
And a surprise star in the live action Mulan

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,600
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,989
This is China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,909
This week’s China news headlines.

7
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,899
The Chinese Communist Party likes to think
of itself

8
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,009
as the world’s next superpower.

9
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,749
And as a superpower,

10
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:30,369
China should have the right to make demands
of other countries.

11
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,120
After all, that’s what’s made America
so beloved.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,579
The most recent demand?

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,070
The US must cancel a 2 billion dollar weapons
sale to Taiwan.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,579
Yes, I’m sure Trump will take that under
advisement.

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:46,559
This is the first major sale of US arms to
Taiwan in decades.

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,809
It includes American anti-aircraft missiles
and battle tanks.

17
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,180
Which unfortunately, is not as good as Japan’s
battleship girls.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,240
Enemy planes targeted.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,860
Loading type 3 shells

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,400
All main guns blow them away

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,620
Yes, those girls are also battleships.

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,740
Japan is a special place.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,130
One where they shipped those characters.

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,380
Literally.

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,460
But the Chinese demands don’t stop at battleship
girls.

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,590
I mean weapons sales to Taiwan.

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,660
China is also demanding an end to US tariffs.

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,610
True, the Chinese Communist Party hasn’t
actually agreed to

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,980
the reforms the US has demanded in return
for ending tariffs.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,860
But there’s a long history of the Party
not doing what the US demands,

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,659
so why shouldn’t they keep getting away
with it?

32
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,050
It’s tradition.

33
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,810
Anyway, Chinese diplomats are warning of disastrous
consequences

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,880
if the US treats China as an enemy.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,289
But according to President Trump, trade talks
are doing very well.

36
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:49,710
Which is also what he said at the end of May.

37
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,590
And in mid-February.

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,700
And in early January.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,570
And the beginning of December.

40
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,270
Trump is clearly a “glass half full” kind
of guy.

41
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,030
But the tariffs may also be affecting demand...for
Bibles.

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,780
Apparently, “millions of Bibles—

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,710
some estimates put it at 150 million or more—

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,280
are printed in China each year.”

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,540
But proposed 25% tariffs on Chinese goods

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,710
also includes tariffs on all books printed
in China.

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,050
And that could mean the Good Book

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,030
could get a good deal more expensive.

49
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,800
According to Geof Morin, president and CEO
of Biblica,

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,950
the International Bible Society,

51
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,810
the tariff would “dramatically affect the
number of Bibles

52
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,240
we are able to print and give away,

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,280
impacting the religious freedom of individuals
in countries

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,180
where Bible access is limited and often nonexistent.”

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,550
Now, I’m all for printing Bibles.

56
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,730
But here’s the thing:

57
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,340
It’s not a Bible tariff.

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,370
It’s a book tariff that affects all books.

59
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,020
And it just so happens that the two largest
Bible publishers in the United States

60
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,560
are owned by the multi-billion dollar publishing
conglomerate HarperCollins.

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,150
And HarperCollins might be hoping to keep
making those big profits

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,760
on the best-selling book in America—

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,060
and on all their other books that are printed
in China, too.

64
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,810
But really, should the US government go soft
on a regime that’s closing churches,

65
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,530
jailing pastors, and even rewriting scripture?

66
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,790
I wonder what the Bible would have to say
about that.

67
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,060
But back to China’s demands.

68
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
As you may have heard,

69
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,590
Hong Kong has erupted in protests over Beijing’s
growing influence in the city.

70
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,370
The One Country, Two Systems model,

71
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,720
where Beijing lets Hong Kong keep its freedoms,

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,090
hasn’t exactly been going well.

73
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,650
But when Hong Kong pop star and activist Denise
Ho

74
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,500
brought that up at a recent UN meeting,

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,480
the Chinese representative demanded she be
quiet.

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,230
“The One Country, Two Systems is nearing
its death,

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,610
protests are still on going…”

78
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,250
“There is a point of order.

79
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,430
I give the floor to China.”

80
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,090
In fact, the Chinese representative interrupted
her twice.

81
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,240
Which was pretty impressive since her speech
was only 90 seconds long.

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,650
Apparently, the Chinese side was upset at
her

83
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,840
for “‘baselessly’ attacking the ‘one
country, two systems’ arrangement.”

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,070
Meanwhile, more Hong Kong protesters have
been arrested.

85
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,330
The protests mostly center around a proposed
extradition bill

86
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,870
that could allow authorities to send people
from Hong Kong to Mainland China for trial.

87
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,180
And Chinese courts have a 99.9% conviction
rate.

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,219
However, in what Hong Kong Chief Executive
Carrie Lam

89
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,110
clearly hopes will finally appease protesters,

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,770
she’s trying to lay the bill to rest.

91
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,060
The bill is dead.

92
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,589
Dead, yes.

93
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,770
But she has repeatedly refused to say the
bill has been withdrawn,

94
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,940
which is the phrase everyone wants to hear.

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Why?

96
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,610
“‘The bill is dead is a political description
and it is not legislative language,’

97
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,009
Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung told the
BBC,

98
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,099
adding that the bill was technically still
in the process of a second reading.”

99
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,370
So it’s dead, but still alive.

100
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,060
Which means...the bill is a zombie!

101
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,249
In other Hong Kong news, advertisers are fleeing
from TVB,

102
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:11,249
the main Hong Kong cable broadcaster.

103
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:15,669
That’s because TVB is believed to have an
increasingly pro-Beijing bias.

104
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,509
One of the bigger sAnd one of the advertisers
to bail is Pocari Sweat.

105
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,310
Pocari Sweat is like Japan’s answer to gatorade.

106
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,800
I drank plenty of it when I was in Hong Kong.

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,810
Even though the name makes it sound like the
bottled sweat of a cute little Pokemon.

108
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,230
But to prove that TVB doesn’t have a pro-Beijing
bias,

109
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,660
a TVB spokesman told my favorite Chinese state-run
media, the Global Times,

110
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,400
“Pocari Sweat’s comments are designed
to please protesters,

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,430
which equals to bowing to violence.”

112
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,690
Yup, no pro-Beijing bias there.

113
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,889
The Global Times went on to say,

114
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,729
“The Japanese company would likely face
tough sanctions on the mainland

115
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,770
for adopting a wrong stance.”

116
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,360
What’s that, Shelley?

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,860
TVB has denied they issued that statement
to the Global Times?

118
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,789
Are you saying that the Global Times might...be
lying?

119
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,350
I don’t believe it.

120
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,699
Meanwhile, some Chinese netizens are accusing
Pocari Sweat

121
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,180
of supporting Hong Kong independence and calling
for a boycott.

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,020
Yes, today is the day that Hong Kongers will
be led to independence

123
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,759
by...a sports drink.

124
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,189
And GZN48, a Chinese girl group with...61
members...

125
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,590
is cutting ties with Pocari Sweat.

126
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,379
China is also a special place.

127
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,379
After the brouhaha,

128
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,300
Pocari Sweat’s parent company issued a vaguely
worded apology,

129
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,530
but seemed to still be pulling their ads from
TVB.

130
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,699
And Pocari Sweat’s sales have surged in
Hong Kong.

131
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,300
“Many residents posted on social media that
they bought the drink,

132
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,279
and some supermarkets and convenience stores
were sold out Wednesday.”

133
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,039
Gotta drink ’em all!

134
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,259
But it’s the people of Xinjiang who really
might

135
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,130
no longer be able to enjoy sugary beverages.

136
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,879
Apparently, white sugar can land you in an
internment camp.

137
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,960
The Chinese Communist Party has been cracking
down on

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,939
what it calls “terrorism” in Xinjiang.

139
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:08,069
That involves putting more than a million
of Xinjiang’s mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs

140
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,599
in internment camps.

141
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,509
And also building the world’s most intrusive
surveillance state there.

142
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,650
And everyone knows the most dangerous tool
in any terrorist’s arsenal...

143
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,650
is white sugar.

144
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,539
It’s now a controlled substance in Xinjiang.

145
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,539
Why?

146
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,120
Because apparently it can be used as explosive
material.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,169
And here I just thought it caused people’s
waistlines to explode.

148
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,319
Xinjiang residents need to present their new
government ID cards

149
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
in order to buy sugar.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,020
“Only a kilogram of white sugar can be purchased
with one ID card,

151
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,120
according to the new regulations.”

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,639
I’m sure it’s just part of a new state-led
fitness trend.

153
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,180
Which is why Chinese leader Xi Jinping is
telling officials to stop being lazy

154
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,780
and spending the whole day eating.

155
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,479
There’s a reason Chinese officials might
seem to be lazy.

156
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,310
More than a million officials have been punished

157
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,080
in Xi Jinping’s so-called anti-corruption
campaign.

158
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,210
So Communist Party officials aren’t being
lazy.

159
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,689
They’re just afraid to do anything without
direct orders.

160
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,360
So they sit around all day and stress eat.

161
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,020
I totally get it.

162
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,479
Xi Jinping went on to tell them,

163
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,830
“Be brave to handle heavy burdens,

164
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,439
crack hard nuts and handle hot potatoes.”

165
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,529
Look, Xi.

166
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,539
If you’re going to tell people to stop eating,

167
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,430
you really should avoid food metaphors.

168
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,990
Speaking of protruding guts, the Beijing bikini.

169
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,319
Found across China, not just Beijing,

170
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,840
it’s a proud and noble tradition to help
men cool off in the summer heat.

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,330
Unfortunately, it’s being banned in some
parts of China.

172
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,270
Maybe this ban will be the final straw that
makes Chinese people

173
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,600
demand an end to the Communist Party’s authoritarian
rule.

174
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,550
In China, you’re not allowed to bring a
live chicken on the subway.

175
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,610
At least in the city of Chongqing.

176
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,220
I mean, makes sense.

177
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,460
Bird flu is sort of a problem there.

178
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,620
But when one woman recently was told

179
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,690
she couldn’t bring her live chicken on the
train,

180
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,520
she did what any reasonable person would do.

181
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,190
She killed it on the spot.

182
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,270
Technically, that chicken now counts as food.

183
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,770
And finally, the trailer for the live action
version of Disney’s Mulan is out!

184
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,730
And the first thing I noticed was—man,

185
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,520
the father sure looks like Xi Jinping!

186
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,730
Maybe he’s looking for another career for
after the Chinese Commuinst Party falls.

187
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,620
Anyway, I’m still disappointed I wasn’t
asked to play the lead role of Mulan.

188
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,200
I can do Kung Fu.

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,850
And what better way to prove that in the 21st
century,

190
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,290
race and gender don’t matter?

191
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,550
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

192
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,310
Yes, yes, you’re right.

193
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,090
I should be Mushu.

194
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,720
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

195
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,400
a fan who support China Uncensored

196
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,240
with a dollar or more per episode,

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,960
by contributing through Patreon.

198
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,230
Robert W Eischen asks,

199
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,760
“Where does one go to ask questions for
the show?

200
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm trying to figure out why Hong Kong hasn't
backed off the treaty yet.

201
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
Are the communists involved in forcing it
through?”

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,970
For the first part of your question:

203
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,560
Patreon supporters like you can leave your
questions right where you did,

204
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,760
as replies to any of the videos we post on
Patreon.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,850
As for your next question,

206
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,390
I’m going to assume the treaty you’re
talking about is the Extradition Bill.

207
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,630
If passed,

208
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,360
it would be like a treaty that allows Hong
Kong authorities

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,780
to send criminal suspects to mainland China
for trial.

210
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,970
Why won’t the Hong Kong government back
down?

211
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,970
It might be because Beijing doesn’t want
to look like

212
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,710
it’s giving in to the demands of protesters.

213
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,170
Imagine what kind of precedent that would
set for the rest of China,

214
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,560
if word ever got out that protests can actually

215
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,850
force the Communist Party to change its policies!

216
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,010
Thanks for your questions, Robert.

217
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,960
And thanks to everyone watching!

218
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,420
We could not make this show without your support.

219
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,320
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

220
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,110
or just watching and sharing the show

221
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,350
with your friends and family.

222
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,880
So thank you from me and everyone on the China
Uncensored team.

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

224
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,220
see you next time.
