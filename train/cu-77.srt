1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,709
This US warship just trolled China

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:06,879
The future of war is in space

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,809
And Burger King is accused of making a racist
ad

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,129
At least no one’s accusing them of making
a decent burger.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,640
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,140
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,349
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,150
This week’s China news headlines.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,939
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,910
visited the Philippines.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,730
While there, he said the US would back the
Philippines

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,090
in the event of any armed attack in the South
China Sea,

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,750
based on their mutual defense treaty.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,800
And now it seems like the US

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,460
is putting muscle behind that statement.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,010
This week, the US sent a warship carrying

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,760
fighter jets near the Scarborough Shoal.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,750
That’s territory both China and the Philippines
claim.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,710
The sighting was first reported by Filipino
television.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,430
“But on the fifth hour of sailing,

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,600
everyone was roused from their naps by a new
site.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,860
An aircraft carrier not three miles away,

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,710
launching and landing its planes

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,039
to the wonder of the watching fisherman.”

25
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,850
Wow, that’s incredible.

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,649
That looked just like the Filipino fishing
boat

27
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:11,469
I took to the Scarborough Shoal.

28
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:15,130
The ship those fishermen saw was the USS Wasp.

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,820
It’s reported to be carrying an unusually
large number of F-35Bs.

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,969
That’s the latest American stealth fighter
plane.

31
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,640
But the Wasp was carrying another secret weapon
—

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
Ant Man.

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,580
Okay, look.

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,350
It’s not always easy to add jokes to these
stories.

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,789
The Wasp was sailing to annual military drills
with the Philippines.

36
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,680
It comes shortly after protests from the Philippine
government

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,420
over 200 Chinese ships near another disputed
island.

38
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,259
Maybe I need to go back to the South China
Sea.

39
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,990
And speaking of disputed territories, Taiwan.

40
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,030
China is very sensitive about its territorial
claim

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,920
to what is essentially an entire country.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,399
So when the London school of Economics displayed
this,

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,549
a sculpture by Mark Wallinger called

44
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,880
‘The World Turned Upside Down’...

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,640
...some people freaked out.

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Why?

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,659
Because China was colored in yellow,

48
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,010
and Taiwan was colored in pink.

49
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,900
Implying it’s a separate country.

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,300
China is very sensitive about maps,

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,599
since that’s how it makes a lot of territorial
claims.

52
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,599
Which is why,

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,599
inside China,

54
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,159
there’s been a crackdown on politically
incorrect maps.

55
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,550
Anyway, a group of Chinese international students,

56
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,310
I’m sure completely independently from the
Chinese consulate,

57
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,310
complained.

58
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,760
And the UK university decided to immediately
give in.

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
But then it became international news.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,470
And now they’ve clarified,

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,829
“No final decisions have been reached.”

62
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,200
Because this is a hard decision to make?

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,220
Honestly, though,

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,780
I’m just upset they put Australia at the
top.

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,510
Speaking of even more territories

66
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,420
the Chinese Communist Party is ruining,

67
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,970
Hong Kong.

68
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,120
Remember the Umbrella Movement a few years
ago?

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
I do.

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,410
For 79 days, protesters,

71
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,269
mainly students and mostly peaceful,

72
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,989
occupied a few main roads in Hong Kong

73
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,260
to demonstrate for democracy.

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,090
Their symbol was a yellow umbrella,

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,719
since they were using umbrellas

76
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,349
to fend off the tear gas

77
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,819
Hong Kong police were throwing at them.

78
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,310
Clearly a menace to society.

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,349
That’s why 9 prominent leaders of the movement

80
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,490
have just been found guilty of causing a nuisance

81
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,209
and inciting others to do the same.

82
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,230
Causing a nuisance can mean up to 7 years
in jail.

83
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,560
Just kidding.

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Each charge of causing a nuisance means 7
years in jail.

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,819
Hong Kong’s doing fine under Chinese rule.

86
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,370
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan

87
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,319
is warning that the next war

88
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,260
will be won or lost in space.

89
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,879
My gosh, lost in space, that’s terrifying!

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,999
That reboot was terrible.

91
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,780
Speaking at the 35th Space Symposium

92
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,469
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

93
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,480
Shanahan said,

94
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,170
“Because of [China and Russia’s] actions,

95
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,950
space is no longer a sanctuary—

96
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,950
it is now a warfighting domain.

97
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,249
This is not a future or theoretical threat;

98
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,590
this is today’s threat.”

99
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,160
But even though Russia was mentioned,

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,500
Shanahan made it clear that China is the real
threat.

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,120
“We wake up much more worried about China

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,360
every day than we do about Russia in space.

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,449
Long term,

104
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,090
China is the one that we’re worried about.

105
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,789
And it’s China cyber,

106
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,250
it’s China space,

107
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,560
it’s China hypersonics—

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,580
it’s the whole package for China.”

109
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,000
Which is so strange,

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,229
because I saw in the movie Valerian,

111
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:39,259
which was cosponsored by a Chinese production
company,

112
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,600
that China will lead space exploration in
the future!

113
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,410
I guess Hollywood is paving the way

114
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,880
for the Chinese Communist Party.

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Speaking of space,

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,069
earlier this week the world got a look at

117
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,120
the first-ever photo of a black hole.

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,030
Which looks like...a black hole.

119
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,830
But the important part is state-run China
Daily

120
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,860
would like you to please remember that

121
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,130
none of this would have been possible without
China.

122
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,860
And also that this black hole has been

123
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,360
part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
And apparently an F-35 fighter plane has gone
missing.

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,419
If you have any knowledge of its whereabouts,

126
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,390
please contact Japan.

127
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,990
Japan lost contact with one of its F-35s 84

128
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,620
miles off the east coast of Japan.

129
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,310
And uh, China and Russia

130
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,720
have a lot of naval patrols out that way so...

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,599
better find it quick.

132
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,599
Tom Moore,

133
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,360
an expert on Russia and weapons tweeted,

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,490
“there is no price too high in this world

135
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,419
for China and Russia to pay to get Japan’s
missing F-35,

136
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,169
if they can.”

137
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,289
Retired US Air Force Lieutenant General David
Deptula

138
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,860
told Business Insider, “Both China and Russia

139
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,099
have excellent reconstruction/reverse engineering/copying
skills,

140
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,099
particularly the Chinese as they are masters
at it.”

141
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,350
But it might not be as bad as you think.

142
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,849
For one, “The jet’s all-important software
and programming

143
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,900
would likely be hard to reconstruct given

144
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,880
not only the likely damage from the crash

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,979
and salt water in [the] Pacific

146
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,470
but also the way that the jet’s sensitive
systems

147
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,110
are designed to be very hard to decipher and
reverse engineer.”

148
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,680
Also, China hacked the F-35 design years ago.

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,180
See?

150
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,720
No problem.

151
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,500
Huawei is the Chinese telecommunications company

152
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,860
the United States government is warning everyone

153
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,770
is a giantatic national security risk.

154
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,050
And now Huawei has a new ally:

155
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,000
a senior cyber security expert

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
who used to work for the White House.

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,199
Huawei has hired Samir Jain

158
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,120
to lobby on their behalf.

159
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,539
Jain used to be the associate deputy US attorney
general.

160
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,039
And he was also a National Security Council
advisor

161
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,659
under the Obama administration.

162
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,360
According to the disclosure filing,

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,270
“He’ll lobby on foreign investment,

164
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,050
government purchasing and ‘security-related
issues

165
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,440
arising under the National Defense Authorization
Act.’”

166
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,100
And finally,

167
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,860
yet another Western company is in trouble

168
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,270
for using chopsticks in their ads.

169
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,849
A New Zealand franchise of Burger King

170
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,419
posted this video on Instagram.

171
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,069
Eating a burger with chopsticks is hard.

172
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,780
It’s the new Vietnamese Sweet Chilli Tendercrisp
Burger.

173
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,289
I am disgusted.

174
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,580
No, not because of the ad.

175
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,720
I mean, look at this thing.

176
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,500
“Social media users in China demanded an
apology,

177
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,110
saying Burger King had made a mockery

178
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,030
of Asian customs and dining etiquette.”

179
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,669
The same thing happened a few months ago

180
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,940
over a Dolce and Gabbana ad.

181
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,199
All I can say is stick a fork in me, I’m
done.

182
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,759
What do you think about this week’s headlines?

183
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,509
Leave your comments below.

184
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,159
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

185
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,159
from one of you—

186
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,220
a fan who support China Uncensored

187
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,140
with a dollar or more per episode,

188
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,080
by contributing through Patreon.

189
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,639
Charlie Matsubara asks,

190
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,419
“Who would win in an arm wrestling match?

191
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,310
Presitator vs King Chris?”

192
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,159
That’s a very good question

193
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,260
and I’d love to get an answer to it myself.

194
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,720
I am assuming I’m King Chris in this scenario.

195
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,040
I’ve been trying to get an interview

196
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,949
with Chinese Presitator Xi Jinping

197
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,009
since at least 2015,

198
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,840
when I tried to meet him during his stay

199
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,520
at the Waldorf Astoria in New York.

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,760
It didn’t go as planned.

201
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,060
Security told me I was banned

202
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,460
from the Waldorf Astoria for life.

203
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,069
Now I’m a pretty good arm wrestler.

204
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,419
Why, I even beat US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher.

205
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,210
You know, maybe that’s why Xi hasn’t shown
up.

206
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,460
He’s afraid I’m going to lay the smackdown
on him.

207
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,459
So here’s what: Xi Jinping,

208
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,350
I know you’re listening,

209
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,990
I’m agreeing to arm wrestle you with my
left arm.

210
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,980
Whenever you’re ready for that interview,

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
I’ll be waiting.

212
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,580
Send me a fax.

213
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Thanks for your question, Charlie.

214
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,920
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

215
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,740
who support China Uncensored.

216
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,070
It’s only because of your support

217
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,620
that we’ve been able to cover topics

218
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,230
that most other media don’t want to,

219
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,480
because they prefer to get advertising dollars,

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,140
rather than criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

221
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,760
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

222
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,780
See you next time.
