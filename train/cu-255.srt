1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,479
want to know a foolproof way to catch a Chinese
spy?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,380
Ask him if he's a spy.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,880
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,160
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,700
We take you now to New Zealand,

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,260
the small nation southeast of Australia,

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,920
and the secret location of Middle Earth.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,910
New Zealand has two main islands,

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,650
five million citizens,

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,290
and 70 million sheep.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,800
It's also home to this guy:

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,820
Jian Yang

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,460
--a member of New Zealand's parliament

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,160
who is definitely, totally,

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,110
not a spy for the Chinese government.

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,710
Unless he is.

18
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,860
Sort of.

19
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,020
Maybe.

20
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,390
That is, if you believe this recent investigation

21
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,020
by the Financial Times and New Zealand's Newsroom.

22
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,710
But Yang insists that the accusations he's
a spy

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,240
are all part of "a racist 'smear campaign.'"

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
"I challenge those are propagating

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,700
these defamatory statements to front up and
prove it."

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,140
Well...they kind of made a strong claim.

27
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,330
And to be clear,

28
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,650
the allegations of spy-stuff aren't because
he's an immigrant

29
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,170
or because he's ethnically Chinese.

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,420
They're because of his actual links

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,860
to an actual Chinese spy agency.

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,280
The links are serious enough

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,560
that New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,880
began looking into Jian Yang five years ago.

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,299
Jian Yang moved to New Zealand in 1999.

36
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,220
In 2011, he was elected as an MP--

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,670
a Member of Parliament.

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,030
But this report I mentioned

39
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,560
raises concerns that his prominent position

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
in New Zealand's government could be an "in"

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,240
for the Chinese Communist Party.

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,830
Yang spent decades at Chinese schools

43
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,259
known to train spies.

44
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,909
Although he accidentally forgot to include
that

45
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,079
on any of his resumes.

46
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,619
Or that he used to be a member

47
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,350
of the Chinese Communist Party.

48
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,680
Ok, to be fair, we've all left something embarrassing

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,229
out of our resumes.

50
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,270
Like the time I hosted a Japanese game show

51
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,210
called Food Floor Dinosaur,

52
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,930
where contestants were forced

53
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,320
to crawl around a giant obstacle course,

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,009
while eating food that had been spilled on
the floor,

55
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,750
while being chased by giant robot dinosaurs.

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,020
It's not quite as embarrassing as joining
the Chinese Communist Party,

57
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,749
but it's close.

58
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,769
Between 1978 and 1994,

59
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,749
Jian Yang studied at the Air Force Engineering
Academy

60
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:24,370
of China's People's Liberation Army,

61
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,560
and then taught English at the Luoyang Foreign
Language Institute.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,309
That last one may sound harmless enough,

63
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,969
but it's run by one of China's

64
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,989
"main military intelligence agencies,"

65
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,800
and is the equivalent of the United State's
NSA.

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,659
The Luoyang Foreign Language Institute is
part of

67
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,129
the PLA's Third Department.

68
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,400
In addition to being the perfect name for

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,189
the next Tom Cruise movie,

70
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,680
the Third Department is responsible

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,239
for spying on communications.

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,889
The Luoyang Foreign Language Institute

73
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,909
teaches up-and-coming young spies

74
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,059
how to speak the languages of the countries

75
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,360
they're going to be spying on after they graduate.

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,659
Besides learning English,

77
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,219
other classes include Tuxedo Wearing 101,

78
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,249
Talking to Your Shoe 101,

79
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:11,340
and Killing 30 Men Armed Only with Your Cufflinks
201.

80
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,650
That one's an advanced seminar.

81
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,049
Now this isn't to say Jian Yang is a Chinese
spy.

82
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,299
He just taught English to Chinese spies

83
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,989
so they could do a better job of spying on
foreign countries.

84
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,339
Still, this this isn't looking good for you,
Jian Yang,

85
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,659
what's your response to the fact you

86
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,340
taught at an elite school for Chinese spies?

87
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,180
"I was a civilian officer.

88
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,019
I was paid by the military but I had no rank."

89
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,140
A civilian...officer?

90
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,200
Paid by the military?

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,920
Care to explain that?

92
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,329
"In China, in the military system,

93
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,580
you have ranking officers,

94
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,980
you have non ranking officers,

95
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,600
what you call civilians in the military."

96
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,780
I was one of the civilians in the military,

97
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,740
Ah I see.

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,079
So in China,

99
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,010
you have ranking officers.

100
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,699
And non-ranking officers.

101
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,449
And you were a non-ranking officer...

102
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,599
who taught classes to Chinese spies.

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,139
Heyyyy Macarena!

104
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,189
Did you know that the Macarena

105
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,419
is actually about a girl who cheats on her
lover

106
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,589
with two of his friends?

107
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:16,650
And then wants to move to New York to seduce
a new lover?

108
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,650
That's true.

109
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,600
Your favorite dance song from the 90s had
terrible,

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,879
hidden depths.

111
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,949
Just like Jian Yang's connections to the CCP

112
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,210
and its spy agencies.

113
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,349
Well Jian Yang, do you have any other defense?

114
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,210
"I can understand that people can be concerned

115
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,410
because they do not understand the Chinese
system.

116
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,290
But once they understand the system,

117
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,389
they should be assured that this is nothing,

118
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,020
really, you should be concerned about."

119
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,430
Exactly.

120
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,139
It's like that clown who lives in the sewers.

121
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,069
At first It seems scary,

122
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,620
but when you take the time to understand It,

123
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,319
you find out It's actually just some kind
of

124
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,629
transdimensional spider that lives off the
fears of children.

125
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,699
Uh, spoiler alert.

126
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,270
But it turns out that this spider also has
a taste for creamy,

127
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,009
delicious, grass-fed New Zealand Anchor Butter.

128
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,080
On a large scale,

129
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,330
the Chinese Communist Party is working to
subvert

130
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,020
New Zealand's government and society.

131
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,509
That was the finding of this recent report,

132
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,669
Magic Weapons:

133
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,090
China's political influence activities under
Xi Jinping.

134
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,669
It uses New Zealand as a case study

135
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,110
for the Chinese regime's "attempts to guide,

136
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,569
buy, or coerce political influence abroad."

137
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,210
Why use New Zealand?

138
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,611
Apparently the Chinese Communist Party

139
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,259
feels the relationship with New Zealand

140
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,860
is a model for other Western countries.

141
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
In other words,

142
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,490
it would like it if all countries could be
as easy to control.

143
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,370
That and Xi Jinping is a huge Lord of the
Rings fan.

144
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,639
Why do you think that report is called Magic
Weapons?

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,229
Xi Jinping is totally into LARPing.

146
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,199
He even learned to speak elvish.

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,639
Quenya and Sindarin.

148
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,020
The magic weapons are the tools

149
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,850
the Chinese regime uses to maintain its power.

150
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,659
Okay, this is sounding like Lord of the Rings.

151
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,940
According to that report,

152
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,349
one method the Communist Party uses

153
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:02,860
to influence foreign countries

154
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,699
is through Chinese communities living there.

155
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,699
The United Front Work Department is in charge
of

156
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,060
creating and financing groups of ethnic Chinese.

157
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,540
There are about 200,000 Chinese people living
in New Zealand.

158
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,640
As the report says,

159
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,960
"Beijing-supported united front groups in
New Zealand

160
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,620
are too multitudinous to list in full."

161
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,979
One example, though,

162
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,659
is the Peaceful Reunification of China Association
of New Zealand.

163
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,599
This is an organization set up in New Zealand.

164
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,419
But it also falls under the jurisdiction

165
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,229
of the Communist Party's United Front Work
Department.

166
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,539
What's "peaceful reunification"?

167
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,469
That's about how the CCP wants to someday

168
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,009
"peacefully" bring Taiwan back under its control--

169
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,969
by peaceful military action if necessary.

170
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,599
This organization, "engages in a range of
activities

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
which support Chinese foreign policy goals,

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
including block-voting and fund-raising

173
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,370
for ethnic Chinese political candidates

174
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,729
who agree to support their organization's
agenda."

175
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,099
They're also the ones that organize counter-protests

176
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:09,189
to shout down those pesky human rights protesters

177
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,360
representing Free Tibet or Taiwan Independence

178
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,910
that come out whenever a Chinese leader visits
New Zealand.

179
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,009
And surprise,

180
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,950
Jian Yang is linked to the Peaceful Reunification
of China Association.

181
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,280
This article on their website brags that MP
Jian Yang

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,279
was at their event in 2012.

183
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,039
Jian Yang has also worked with them

184
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,090
and other Chinese organizations to raise big
money

185
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,310
from anonymous Chinese donors

186
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,199
to support New Zealand's National Party.

187
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,330
He's also accompanied the current and former

188
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,160
New Zealand Prime Minister on fabulous red
carpet trips to China,

189
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,000
and met with high-level Chinese officials.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,939
But does this mean Jian Yang is a spy for
the CCP?

191
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,090
He says he's not a spy.

192
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,530
But he's also clearly not like the many immigrants

193
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,889
who left China because they don't like the
Communist Party,

194
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,509
or want to disavow their connections with
China's brutal regime.

195
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,650
No, he's definitely pro brutal regime.

196
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,389
I mean, Jian Yang was a former CCP member,

197
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,990
and he attended a Chinese military academy,

198
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,050
and taught English to spies-in-training at
one of China's big spy schools,

199
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,580
and works with pro-CCP organizations in New
Zealand.

200
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,050
But there's no conclusive evidence

201
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,159
that he's some sort of "plant"

202
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,389
or a James Bond type spy.

203
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,559
I mean, James Bond wouldn't be caught dead
dressed like this.

204
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,720
It's clear that Jian Yang did not teach tuxedo
wearing 101.

205
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,909
But there's actually a big spectrum

206
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,899
between not being a spy and being a spy for
the CCP.

207
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,899
For example,

208
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,420
without being an actual spy,

209
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,470
you can still serve the interests of the CCP.

210
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,520
Like how Jian Yang helped lead New Zealand

211
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,370
to catch the "Belt and Road" train of Chinese
investment.

212
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,970
So regardless of whether Jian Yang is a spy,

213
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,970
was a spy,

214
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,120
or was never a spy,

215
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,570
one thing's clear:

216
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,829
As a member of parliament,

217
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,620
he's representing pro-CCP interests

218
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,700
within the New Zealand government.

219
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,350
It's kind of like you have a government official,

220
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,410
but then you find out he used to work for
Saruman.

221
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,240
And now the question is: Does he still work
for Saruman?

222
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,279
The good news is,

223
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,110
have lots more time to figure that out,

224
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,230
since Jian Yang just got re-elected

225
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,320
as a list MP by the National Party.

226
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,279
So even though voters didn't directly vote
for him,

227
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,850
his party wants to keep him around.

228
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,850
What do you think?

229
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,089

230
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,280
Once again I'm Chris Chappell,

231
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,139
thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

232
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
I know, you'd rather be LARPing with Xi Jinping.

233
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,160
But since he's not available,

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,730
how about instead you go to China Uncensored.tv,

235
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,379
where you can watch full half hour episodes
of China Uncensored for free.
