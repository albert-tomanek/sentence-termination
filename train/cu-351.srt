1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,699
China is using the New Zealand Massacre

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,900
to justify mass surveillance of Muslims in
China

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,760
Are you really surprised?

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,540
This is China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,170
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,451
The March 15 massacre

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,490
at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,680
shocked the world.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,790
A lone gunman killed 50 Muslims.

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,160
This is and will be one of New Zealand’s
darkest days.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,950
Now we can all agree it was a dark day for
New Zealand.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,730
But no country was hurt more by this senseless
massacre, than China.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,999
That’s because the Chinese Communist Party

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,690
deeply loves all Muslims.

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,960
You can tell by how they treat

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,129
some of the Muslims under their own rule—

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,870
the ethnic Uighurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous region.

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,550
The Chinese regime has installed a mass surveillance
system

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,940
unlike anything the world has ever seen.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,569
“The security here is incredibly tight.

21
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,010
There are armored cars on the street.

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,929
Police stations on every corner.

23
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,600
And tons of surveillance cameras.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,960
In the past year,

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,890
police have stepped up security.

26
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,350
The region is now under probably

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,640
the most intense government surveillance in
the world.”

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Wow.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,710
The Communist Party is really sparing

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,310
no effort to keep the Uighurs safe.

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,881
And the New Zealand Massacre

32
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:21,810
is an important reminder as to why.

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,630
At least according to the Xinjiang government.

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,170
Why, they’ve event sent a fax to the Wall
Street Journal

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,920
saying just that.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,930
The fax said,

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,079
“The recent mass shooting in New Zealand

38
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,310
that harmed so many innocent lives is a strong
warning.

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,759
The goal of improving security at mosques

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,840
is to protect the ability of the Muslim community

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,259
to hold normal, orderly religious activities.”

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,439
Yes, the Chinese regime

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,310
is using the New Zealand massacre

44
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,439
to justify its mass surveillance of Muslims.

45
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,439
And don’t forget,

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,369
according to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

47
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,369
the Global Times,

48
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,539
it’s a model worth copying.

49
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,329
The Xinjiang government felt they needed to

50
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,430
straighten things out with the Wall Street
Journal

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,340
in their fax.

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,759
Yes, the country with the world’s

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,620
most advanced surveillance system

54
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,110
wants you to know,

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,500
it still relies on the world’s

56
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,930
least advanced communication system.

57
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,720
A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal published
this article.

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,900
And they showed this satellite footage of

59
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,980
a Uighur neighborhood being razed to the ground.

60
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,739
But the Chinese fax clarified,

61
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,190
“This argument that ‘shantytown redevelopment

62
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,860
is intended to force some Uighur migrants

63
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,280
to leave the city and place others in residential
buildings

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,920
that are easier to monitor’

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,200
is a slanderous fabrication.”

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,110
Again, the surveillance is for their safety!

67
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,650
Why is it so hard for people in the West

68
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,420
to understand that to keep you safe,

69
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,170
it’s necessary for the government

70
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,540
to monitor you at all times?

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,299
Otherwise how will they know if

72
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,370
you’re being threatened by dangerous beliefs?

73
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,890
Like a belief in a higher power.

74
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,129
Other than the Communist Party, of course.

75
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,280
And safety is also why Chinese authorities

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,099
are working hard to bring that kind of surveillance

77
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,909
to the rest of China.

78
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,659
It will make for a more trusting society.

79
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,110
Don’t agree?

80
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,530
Well, “Denouncing the Chinese system

81
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,180
from a Western point of view

82
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,420
is tantamount to a neo-imperialistic attitude.”

83
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,920
The fax to the Wall Street Journal

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,360
also criticized the paper for lying about

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,150
so-called internment camps in Xinjiang.

86
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,060
“According to the UN,

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,050
authorities are detaining as many as a million
Uighurs

88
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,490
in facilities like the one we saw in Urumqi.

89
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,760
Satellite images show how China’s government

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,930
has built these facilities at a frenetic pace.”

91
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,819
Gah, those no good satellites.

92
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:48,819
Don’t worry,

93
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,480
I don’t think they’ll be a problem for
long.

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,610
Also, those so-called internment camps

95
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,720
are actually just job training centers...

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,329
that also combat extremist thinking.

97
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,420
With job training.

98
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,959
And that’s why the people in those training
centers are so happy.

99
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,430
“If you’re happy and you know it clap
your hands.”

100
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,459
So what do you think of China

101
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,909
using the New Zealand Massacre

102
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,430
to justify mass surveillance of Muslims in
Xinjiang?

103
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,410
Tell me what you think in the comments below.

104
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,090
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

105
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,160
a fan who support China Uncensored

106
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,140
with a dollar or more per episode,

107
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,889
by contributing through Patreon.

108
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,350
Rabbit L. Benkei asks,

109
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,040
“Chris, what country would you say

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,040
China is most effectively influencing?”

111
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
That’s a hard question to answer.

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
There is barely a country on Earth

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,980
that the Chinese Communist Party isn’t influencing.

114
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,280
That was something I really realized

115
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,640
after I went to the Oslo Freedom Forum in
2018.

116
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
It’s a big human rights conference

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,420
where activists around the world talk about

118
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,180
their struggles with authoritarian regimes.

119
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,210
And it seemed like no matter which country
they come from,

120
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,870
the Chinese Communist Party was somehow

121
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,960
working there behind the scenes.

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
It’s not just authoritarian countries, either.

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,569
Western liberal democracies like the United
States

124
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,220
are also being heavily influenced.

125
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,850
China has tremendous sway over Hollywood.

126
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,810
American politicians have been influenced

127
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,100
and bought off.

128
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,440
Got a 401K?

129
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,800
Or mutual funds?

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,560
Odds are some of your money is invested in
China.

131
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,310
And with China setting its sights on the moon

132
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,310
And Mars,

133
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,180
It may even be trying to influence other planets.

134
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,000
But which country is the Chinese regime influencing
most?

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,140
I’d say Taiwan.

136
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,820
They’ve tried to interfere with Taiwan’s
elections.

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,230
They pump money into Taiwan

138
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,530
to influence politicians and business leaders.

139
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,770
And they’ve forced the government

140
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,020
to spend enormous resources

141
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,850
preparing for a Chinese military invasion
of their island.

142
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,000
On the other hand,

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,220
maybe Taiwan isn’t the country most influenced—

144
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,310
since according to the Chinese regime,

145
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,120
Taiwan’s not a country;

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,400
it’s been a province of China since ancient
times.

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,300
Thanks for your question, Rabbit.

148
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,550
And thanks to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

149
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,910
who support China Uncensored.

150
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,520
It’s only because of your support

151
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,110
that we’ve been able to cover topics like
this,

152
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,300
that most other media don’t want to.

153
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,880
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,980
See you next time.
