1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,890
Cameroon

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,029
It’s got gold, timber, oil

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,890
And strategic ports

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,979
China wants it.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,460
And it will do what it takes to get it.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,860
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,100
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Africa.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,400
It has resources.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,630
China wants them.

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,980
And nowhere is that more apparent than in
Cameroon.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,240
Cameroon one of the breadbaskets of Africa.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,090
It’s also loaded with diamonds, gold, and
oil.

14
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,949
Plus, it’s strategically located,

15
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,160
with several ocean ports the Chinese military

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,120
would love to have access to.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,750
This is Cameroon’s “president” is Paul
Biya.

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,460
He’s been president for 36 years.

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,510
Which can only mean one thing:

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,910
The people love him so much,

21
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,199
they keep re-electing him in free and fair
elections!

22
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,850
And he’s only too happy to give

23
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,950
the Chinese Communist Party

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,970
the access to Cameroon it craves.

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,810
To find out more about China’s

26
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,140
colonial plans in Cameroon and Africa at large,

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,429
I sat down with Felix Agbor Nkongho,

28
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,039
at the Oslo Freedom Forum.

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,710
He’s the founder and director of the Centre
for Human Rights

30
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,600
and Democracy in Africa.

31
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,280
Thank-you for joining us today Felix.

32
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,290
Well thanks for having me.

33
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,290
Yeah.

34
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,610
So for those people who aren't really familiar
with Cameroon,

35
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,920
can you tell us a little bit about the political
situation there?

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,310
Cameroon is situated between West and Central
Africa,

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,790
so it's in the middle of these two regions.

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,370
It's the bread basket of the area.

39
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,020
We have a civilian president who's been in
power for 36 years.

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,200
Since the independence of Cameroon we've had
two presidents.

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,009
Cameroon is francophone and anglophone.

42
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,830
The francophones are 75% of the population,

43
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,219
and the anglophones are 25, English and French.

44
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,930
And that sort of ties back

45
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,030
to which parts of Cameroon had been colonized

46
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,290
by the French and the Germans.

47
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,630
Yes it goes back to the British and the French
colonizing.

48
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,170
That's why you have francophones and anglophones
in Cameroon.

49
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,870
So when you say "president for 36 years",

50
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm assuming that's not a fair,

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,840
democratically elected president.

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,700
On paper it's a democracy, he has a constitution,

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,229
he has an executive legislator, and a judiciary,

54
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,899
but in reality it's a dictatorship.

55
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,390
The elections have never been free and fair,

56
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,450
the opposition is always muscled out, the
press is never free.

57
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,720
The entire process, the electoral commission
from [inaudible]

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,290
to [inaudible] is created by the president
in power,

59
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,430
and he appoints each and every one who is
a member of that committee.

60
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,150
You cannot really really bite the finger that
feeds you,

61
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,319
somebody cannot appoint you and you work against
his interests.

62
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,880
So I imagine it's not an easy place to be
a human rights lawyer.

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,290
Oh it's really difficult, because the thing
about Cameroon

64
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,010
is that from the outside it seems to be very
peaceful.

65
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,050
When you look at the region -

66
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,490
Chad, Central African Republic, [inaudible]
-

67
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,850
all of them have have turbulence,

68
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,580
all of them have [inaudible] dictators.

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,780
Mr Biya seems to be a democrat,

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,940
so from the outside it's very [inaudible],

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,489
but when you get into the country you start
seeing what is happening.

72
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,440
The violations of rights of human rights defenders,

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,549
the anglophone minorities, the people in the
north.

74
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,989
So the press is muscled out.

75
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,440
So when you get inside the country,

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,170
that's when you can understand the dictatorship

77
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,159
that we have in Cameroon.

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,810
So I know President Biya has been pushing
for closer ties to China.

79
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,799
How has that affected the human rights situation
in the country?

80
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,120
Well our relationship with China dates back.

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,879
They call it Palais des Congrès, the congress
hall in Cameroon

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,340
was built by the Chinese.

83
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,459
A long time ago, more than 20 years ago.

84
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,220
It just got burnt a couple of years ago

85
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,220
and they promised to fund it.

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,409
He has been pushing a lot to the East, China
and Russia,

87
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,940
because these are countries that don't care
about human rights record.

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,830
The West, especially the U.S. and the E.U.

89
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,849
they've been [inaudible] on Biya to try to
open up,

90
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,860
to respect more fundamental freedoms,

91
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,010
especially with what is happening in anglophone
Cameroon.

92
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,049
So he's now looking to the East.

93
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,900
China is pumping a lot of money,

94
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,370
China is involved,

95
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,800
and I think China will be an impediment if
we're to have

96
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,040
a security counsel resolution on Cameroon.

97
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,599
So President Biya would be more interested
in taking money from China

98
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,660
rather than countries that would have human
rights obligations.

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,130
Yeah that's what he's been doing of late.

100
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,510
It's true that he plays his cards

101
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,370
in a way that he's still friends with the
West,

102
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,239
but he's leaning more now to China.

103
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,400
Because the accountability issue is not there.

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,310
So he prefers to take money from China,

105
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,660
because China will not care about the killings
of the people,

106
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,020
China will not care about burning of villages
in Cameroon.

107
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,390
I know Cameroon is part of China's Belt and
Road Initiative,

108
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,450
what does China hope to get out of Cameroon?

109
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,880
Well China needs the resources from Cameroon.

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,290
Cameroon has diamonds, Cameroon has oil,

111
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,470
Cameroon has timber, gold too.

112
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,230
So China is interested in the resources of
Cameroon.

113
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,360
There's nothing like a free lunch.

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,820
I know people who criticize the relationship
that we had with the West,

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,151
colonialism and the rest,

116
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:55,010
but China is another colonial power in disguise.

117
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,800
China is giving loans, there's a lot of corruption
in the contracts,

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,620
nobody is accountable, there's no transparency,

119
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,720
and we are indebted to them a lot.

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,610
I know at times they will cancel some of the
debt,

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,890
but they are getting enormous resources from
us,

122
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,370
and Chinese are migrating to Cameroon.

123
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,740
They are doing some of the business

124
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,390
that local people are supposed to be doing,

125
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,390
they are fishing,

126
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,920
and there's gradually tension between the
Chinese and the Cameroonians.

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,580
So, Chinese leader Xi Jinping calls it "win-win
cooperation",

128
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,990
but doesn't sound like this is actually a
win for the people of Cameroon.

129
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,150
No, from my own perspective it's not a win-win
situation.

130
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,590
It's not winning for the people of Cameroon.

131
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,330
It might be winning for the government and
for China.

132
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,250
The average Cameroonian is not benefiting
a lot.

133
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,500
The government cannot account to some of these
monies that are given,

134
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,240
and it's like mortgaging the destiny of future
generations.

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,190
So it's win-win yes,

136
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,190
win for the Chinese government

137
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,090
and win for the Cameroonian government,

138
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,900
but it's a win-loss for the Cameroonian people.

139
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,400
And I know Cameroon is in a very strategic
location in the region,

140
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,430
and China has shown an interest in a billion
dollar port.

141
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,000
What's behind that?

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,590
Well, as you said Cameroon is strategically
located.

143
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,600
Central Africa region, West Africa, we're
bordered to Nigeria,

144
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Chad, and the Central
African Republic.

145
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,510
So strategically we are very important.

146
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,390
And we have the outlet, we have the ports,

147
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,150
we have one in Douala, we have one in Kribi,

148
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,970
and I just hear there will be one in Limbe.

149
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,680
So the Chinese are interested in Cameroon,

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
they are very interested.

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,810
A lot of powers are interested in Cameroon,

152
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,140
but of late the Chinese are developing a lot
of interest.

153
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,070
Because also agriculturally Cameroon is very
rich,

154
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,870
the soil is extremely, extremely rich.

155
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,950
So if we are not careful the coming years,

156
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,130
Cameroon will be a playground for power politics.

157
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,320
Cameroon will be a playground

158
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,380
for Chinese interests and Chinese politics.

159
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,100
So we talked a bit about it that Cameroon
is in a lot of debt to China.

160
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,040
How has that affected Cameroon?

161
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,800
Well for now, the government is just trying
to survive.

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,690
So they keep on piling debt upon debt.

163
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,820
They think that it will postpone their problems

164
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,000
because the more they have pressure from the
West,

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,940
the more they're trying to open up the economy,

166
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,280
they are now looking towards China,

167
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
they will pile the debts.

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,150
Some of the infrastructures that have built,

169
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,790
they cannot stand the test of time.

170
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,610
And you look at the workers,

171
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,550
China brings almost everybody from China to
work.

172
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,930
So what is the local content,

173
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,180
how does that benefit the average Cameroonian?

174
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,830
I mean from the laborers, they are brought
from China.

175
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,170
And even when Cameroonians work there,

176
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,840
they don't pay them very well.

177
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,790
And the fact that most of them don't communicate
in English.

178
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,130
The Kumba Mamfe Ekok road that was built

179
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,700
by the Chinese leading to Nigeria,

180
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,080
I mean I was going to my village,

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,330
my village is off the road.

182
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,290
The instructions on the signs were in Chinese.

183
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,650
So a village that would not even understand
what they were saying,

184
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,930
I did not find any of the instructions in
English.

185
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,610
So this is something that a government that
works for the people,

186
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,230
that has the interests of the people at heart

187
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,120
would have to take some of these things in
consideration.

188
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,990
But unfortunately, they don't really care.

189
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,370
So the infrastructure they're building is
not actually good quality,

190
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,460
the loans aren't sustainable,

191
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,180
this really doesn't seem like it's benefiting
the people [crosstalk]

192
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,930
It's not benefiting us, and there's some things

193
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,900
that they're doing that will backfire.

194
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,880
I remember [inaudible] once that "when you
come to Africa

195
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,970
and you buy the farms, you buy the lands,
and you plant,

196
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,700
and the people cannot have food, someday they
will rise up".

197
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,080
And that is what will happen in Africa,

198
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,830
that is what will happen in Cameroon.

199
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,250
When they Chinese come with their monies,

200
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,370
and they buy huge parcels of land,

201
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,090
and plant crops that are exported to China,

202
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,790
and the people in Cameroon cannot have food,

203
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,830
they will rise up.

204
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,830
They will protest.

205
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,690
Just imagine that if they had bought land

206
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,770
in the English speaking part of the country,

207
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,770
and now there's a crisis.

208
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,770
How will they have access to those lands?

209
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,770
How will they have access to those lands?

210
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,710
Because the people also will be like these
lands did not benefit us.

211
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,960
They probably dealt with the government,

212
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
they dealt with the chiefs,

213
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,910
without the average person benefiting anything.

214
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,110
And the quality of their product,

215
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,160
it's not really good.

216
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,870
Well as you mentioned, China is basically
functioning

217
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,470
as a new type of colonial power in Cameroon.

218
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,560
Is there a sense among the people there,

219
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,600
do they understand this,

220
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,870
do they know what's happening?

221
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,480
They are gradually, gradually coming to terms
with it.

222
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,030
Initially it was their hatred for the French,

223
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,080
they preferred any other person than the French,

224
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,610
because of its colonial history.

225
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,930
But I think that some people are gradually,

226
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,370
gradually seeing that China doesn't speak,

227
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,040
they are slowly and gradually and surely taking
over control

228
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,430
of businesses in the country.

229
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,020
People have started rising up, people have
started criticizing it,

230
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,820
people are complaining in the media.

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,060
And it will only get worse as things get bad
for the country.

232
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,090
So Cameroon is billions of dollars in debt
to China.

233
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,960
But recently though China forgave 78 million
dollars of debt.

234
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,110
Why was that?

235
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,070
Well as I said, there's nothing like a free
lunch.

236
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,150
They know what they are benefiting from the
system.

237
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:10,350
They are trying also to keep Mr Biya in power
at all costs.

238
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,650
So they will help Mr Biya to stay in power.

239
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,270
They provide military software also.

240
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,890
Because of the anglophone crisis,

241
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,280
they provided some support for humanitarian,

242
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,150
to help those who are affected by the crisis.

243
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,770
So whatever they are doing

244
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,560
is to ensure that their friend stays in power,

245
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,920
because they understand that if things were
to change,

246
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
if we have a free and fair election,

247
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,060
if we have a real, genuine, democratic government,

248
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,230
those contract would be renegotiated.

249
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,680
Those terms that they agreed on,

250
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,270
Cameroonians would like no, it has to go through
parliament,

251
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,060
the people have to see it, it has to be more
transparent,

252
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,600
it has to be a win-win contract from the perspective
of the people

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
and not the leadership.

254
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,370
The road signs might not have to be in Chinese.

255
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,660
They will not have to be in Chinese.

256
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,250
They will have to be in English and French.

257
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,660
If you want to put it in Chinese for their
workers,

258
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,480
can understand they should be in English and
French also.

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,140
So I know the U.S. and many other Western
countries

260
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,230
are beginning to take an interest

261
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,210
in investing more in African countries.

262
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,490
Do you think that can be a rival to Chinese
investment?

263
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,420
Yeah competition is always good.

264
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,800
There was a time when we had only the Western
investors.

265
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,070
So they have good quality,

266
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,750
but probably there are times when also not
favorable to our people.

267
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,370
So China is now in the market,

268
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,370
China is another player,

269
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,850
so everybody is setting up.

270
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Because after a while,

271
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,380
the West also looked at Asia, looked at Latin
America.

272
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,680
They were not ready for coastal Africa,

273
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,760
but because China is there,

274
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
China has come to stay,

275
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,770
China has been signing some contracts

276
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,070
that initially used to be exclusively reserved
for the West,

277
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,780
they have woken up from slumber,

278
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,860
and they too are now getting back into the
game.

279
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,400
So it will be an exciting battle between China
and the West

280
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,700
to win the minds and hearts of the people

281
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,250
with regards to their resources.

282
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,610
And you think that's something the West might
be able to do?

283
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,130
Yes, they are capable of doing.

284
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,590
The more democratic the country is,

285
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,300
I think the more people will want to deal
with the West.

286
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,150
The more dictator run the country,

287
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,470
they will have to deal with China and Russia,

288
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,730
because as you know,

289
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,590
they will not talk anything about the human
rights violations.

290
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,490
They would shut up their mouth,

291
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,200
get their deals done,

292
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,740
rights have been violated,

293
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,960
nobody cares.

294
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,050
Well that's interesting because the West,

295
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,620
there's a history of colonialism which obviously

296
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,470
there's a lot of resentment there.

297
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,800
And China in particular is very good at the
propaganda of

298
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,230
"Oh, we were victims of colonialism, we won't
be like that",

299
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,690
when in fact that is what's happening.

300
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:38,400
Do you think people will understand that situation,

301
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,180
and that the past can be forgotten,

302
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,390
r not forgotten but at least forgiven?

303
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,990
Well you can look at colonialism from a multi-faceted
angle.

304
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,210
There could be political, there could be economical,

305
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,980
there could be military colonialism.

306
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,150
So yes, China was not a colonial power in
Africa,

307
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,440
but they are coming in also as an economical
colonial power,

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,779
so what is the difference between

309
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,860
what they're doing and what the West did?

310
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,570
I think what we need in Africa,

311
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,180
what we need in Cameroon, is a fair deal.

312
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,450
Whoever comes should do deals that would be
good for the people,

313
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,830
not the leadership.

314
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,210
And also don't support a leader

315
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,130
that you're giving your money to violate peoples'
rights,

316
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,130
to kill people.

317
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,380
You don't supply arms to use to kill the people.

318
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,810
If they can be that transparent,

319
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,120
which I think they will not be able

320
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,500
because of the nature of the Chinese government.

321
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,690
Say who comes with equity must come with [inaudible],

322
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,470
the way they treat their own people.

323
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,279
They cannot treat us better than they way
they treat their people,

324
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,380
so it's clear that China would not live up
to the expectation.

325
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,060
I think the West has tried a lot to change
also,

326
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,550
from its colonial mentality.

327
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,680
And we have numerous cases where

328
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,790
they put the interests of the people first.

329
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,000
For example, like the Americans,

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,450
they would always talk about human rights
violation,

331
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,170
they would always ensure that there's transparency,

332
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,210
and if you are found paying bribes or involved
in corruption,

333
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,060
you will be tried in the U.S., you'll be sentenced.

334
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,870
So these are checks and balances that we need,

335
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,180
these are checks and balances

336
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,410
that would help the corrupt officials in Africa,

337
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,110
and the corrupt officials coming from the
West or China

338
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,660
to ensure that at least it's not business
as usual.

339
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,240
Things must change and we must also look the
interests of the people.

340
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,810
You kind of touched on this;

341
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,820
is China providing Biya with weapons or military
training?

342
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,981
Yeah they're providing weapons,

343
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:26,380
they're providing weapons to Cameroon a lot.

344
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,500
The Chinese [inaudible] also they're providing

345
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,440
weapons to Cameroon a lot.

346
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,880
They're providing military training.

347
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,630
We have a good military cooperation with China.

348
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,029
They are supporting lots of projects also.

349
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,450
During the last presidential election,

350
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,560
all the gadgets that were used

351
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,530
by Mr Biya's ruling party was printed in China.

352
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,530
Everything was done in China,

353
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,350
so that you can see the influence of China.

354
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,150
So we spent lots and lots of money to print
gadgets in China,

355
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,300
that shows the kind of relationship he has
with the Chinese.

356
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,850
How about Chinese social controls,

357
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,210
like internet surveillance,

358
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,300
facial recognition cameras, any of that?

359
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,390
We gradually, from a human rights defenders
perspective,

360
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,710
we're getting a bit scared.

361
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,550
There was a time WhatsApp had been tampered
with.

362
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,700
The presence of [inaudible] and the Chinese,

363
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,110
we are a bit scared now what is going to happen.

364
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,589
Because these are countries,

365
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,950
I mean China especially has issues with the
internet.

366
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,440
To put it lightly.

367
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Yes.

368
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
And the war for example,

369
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,282
the struggle democratic training in Cameroon

370
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:28,600
shows that the internet is a major player.

371
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,250
Social media will be the thing that will determine

372
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,010
who would be the next president,

373
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,090
that would determine the change in the country.

374
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,790
So we're a bit worried that the influence
of China,

375
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,320
the role China plays, might affect censorship.

376
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,810
Don't forget that between January 2017 and
April 2017

377
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,440
we had the longest internet shut down in the
history of mankind,

378
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,410
about four months the internet was shut down

379
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,870
in English speaking parts of the country.

380
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,540
So these are things that we're a bit worried

381
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,590
and we hope that the internet will not be
cut off again.

382
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,440
Do you have any sense of China's overall plan
for Africa?

383
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,950
I don't know what is my sense,

384
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,000
but what the overall plan is

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,220
to take over the economy of the continent.

386
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,350
To have as many contracts as possible

387
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,040
so that they can control the continent.

388
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,910
Because there is a fight between [inaudible]
imaginary fight

389
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,210
between China and the West.

390
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,120
So everybody wants to control the resources
of Africa.

391
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,440
And because most of the 54 countries are dictators,

392
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,190
a lot of them are going towards China.

393
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,040
Don't forget the building of the African Union
in Ethiopia

394
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,440
was a gift given by China.

395
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,070
So China is there to conquer the markets.

396
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,610
China needs the resources.

397
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,470
China's growing population,

398
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,510
China doesn't have a choice than to look outward,

399
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,650
and Africa for now is a soft area,

400
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,370
Africa for now is an area where you can manipulate
the leaders,

401
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,400
Africa is an area where,

402
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,210
because of a lot of greed and [inaudible]

403
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,990
and selfishness and [inaudible] from our leaders,

404
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,330
they can constantly deal with China to stay
in power.

405
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,490
So China would be a big player,

406
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,910
the economy of our countries will suffer

407
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,420
unless we stand up and start having fair deals
with China.

408
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,700
Well thank-you very much for joining us today,

409
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,440
it was fascinating.

410
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,960
Thanks for having me.
