1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey Nige, can you get me another coke?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,580
It's just downstairs.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
Nah, the tennis is on.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,880
You come to my house to watch the tennis and you're not even going to get me another coke?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, it's the tiebreaker.  Relax.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,320
You know what I wish we had? Like a really long straw so we don't even have to go downstairs to the kitchen.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,660
That would be pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.  Right?

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
How long of a straw could we actually make that you could use?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,420
Downstairs is a bit of a stretch I reckon.  Yeah.  How much is that, like, 3, 4 meters? Do you think we could?

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,740
I reckon we could do it.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,660
We'd need a lot of straws though.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,720
We got a pack here.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,700
Oh, okay.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,180
Now our first test, just to see that Nigel can use a straw properly, we've got about a 1 meter length of straw here.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,380
Think you can suck through that?

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,000
I could give it a go.  So we just taped these drinking straws together, and hopefully

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,300
Yeah, that's alright.  But there's a lot of air coming through I think from the

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,780
The joints in the straw, yeah.  We've gotta come up with some better way to test this out.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,280
I happen to have 6 meters of plastic tubing here.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,000
Non-toxic?

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Uhh, that's what they said at the hardware store.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,620
We're preparing the preliminary tests.  Nigel is lowering some tubing off the balcony.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,060
He actually thinks he's got a shot at sucking through 6 meters of tubing

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,340
I think he's got no chance and he's going to be nowhere close, but

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,540
I think this will allow us to establish how much Nigel actually sucks.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,920
(laughing)

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,640
He's getting ready up there.  He knows there's a lot riding on it.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,780
When you're ready!

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
Look at that! Look at that!  Woah, he shoots up!

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,720
He's got 2 meters! He's got three meters!

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,660
Look at that guy go! He's getting 4 meters, 4 meters!

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,220
5! 5 meters! 6!

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Yeah!  (Cheering)

35
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,820
Now I'm going to try to do the same thing, but the tube I'm using has a thicker diameter.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,660
Mine is about 5 mil, where as Nigel's was 3mil.

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,680
So we're going to see if this makes any difference.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:20,040
(Inspiring music)

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,900
Now, I guess the obvious question is, can Nigel do it?

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,140
Nigel thinks that's the obvious answer but I'm pretty sure he's going to fail.

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,460
Now, maybe what's worth talking about is how a straw works in the first place.

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,580
How does it work?

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,160
Yeah, cause this is really just a big bendy straw.  If we look at a smaller version of a straw here

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,960
We should all be familiar with how this works.  Or should we?

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,440
I don't know.  I think most people think you're just sucking the liquid in and swallowing it.

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,420
But, you knid of have to think about air pressure.

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,900
Yeah, because actually what's happening is that air pressure is causing the, coke in this case, to go up the straw.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,420
Well there's a difference in pressure in the atmospheric pressure and the pressure that you create

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,300
by opening up your lungs and pulling your diaphragm down.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,280
So you reduce the pressure in your mouth, and it's that difference in pressure

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,820
between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside you

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
which gets that liquid flowing into you.

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,820
someone has failed at the 5 mm diameter and you're the next guy to take it on.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,860
You ready for this?

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,640
I am ready.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,580
He's been practicing his whole life for this.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Yeah, you can see it's a strong start.

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,880
Strong start from Quan

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,080
You've got it.  Oh, he's going big right here.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
You can see there's a lot of determination.

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,920
He's getting close, getting close.  Look at this.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,080
Look at this.  Can he do it? Can he do it?

64
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Ohhhhhh, and he's done it!

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,080
(cheering)

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Agh.  That tastes disgusting.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Yeah I definitely felt like my tounge, while I was trying to suck it up

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,540
was being pulled out into the straw

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,080
(off) I felt the same thing

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,680
But.

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
And it was tougher, definitely tougher.

72
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,820
Well done sir.

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,060
Thank you.  Means a lot.

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,440
For his next challenge, we're going to try to get him to suck through 10.3 meters

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,580
which is the theoretical maximum, size of straw

76
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,680
How are you feeling?

77
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,680
Well, that theoretical maximum, kind of relies on being able to get a perfect vacuum

78
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,040
and, although I am perfect in a lot of ways, I don't know that I can create a perfect vacuum.

79
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,560
I have often thought that there is actually a perfect vacuum inside Nigel's head

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,220
Today we're going to really find out, won't we?

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,860
Ok, we've got the setup here.  We're down at Tamarama Beach

82
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,760
And we have 10.5 meters worth of tubing

83
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,600
Which goes all the way up to Nigel at the very top there.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,940
So I'm going to see if I can relive some of my former glory

85
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,780
and get the red liquid up this height.

86
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,960
3!  2!  1!

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,640
There you have it.  Nigel is starting to suck on that straw.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,380
There he goes.

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Looking strong.  Create that vacuum.

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Approaching the edge of the cliff there.  Go, Nigel, Go!

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
C'mon, Nigel!

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,240
Doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  We seem a bit stuck.

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,260
At that point right there.  You can see the determination, the focus.

94
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Trying to see how high that is

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,420
He's done well

96
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,280
But it just doesn't look like it's going to happen.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
(Music stops, and breaks down. Signalling failure)

98
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Alright, so Nigel did pretty well there

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,400
We saw that he could get that liquid up the tube about 7 meters.

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Not the theoretical maximum of ten meters.

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Still more than you.  Just saying.

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,740
That's a good point. That's a good point.

103
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,740
If Nigel could have created a perfect vacuum, then the water would have

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,940
gone up to 10.3 meters, according to our calculations.

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
This is kind of similar to how they used to measure atmospheric pressure in the old days.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
by millimeters of mercury.

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,780
So atmospheric pressure would push mercury up a tube with  a vacuum at the other end

108
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,240
760 millimeters.

109
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,780
760 millimeters. So about .76 of a meter.

110
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,900
So you can see why they used mercury and not water

111
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,740
because if you were doing this with water, you'd need

112
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,360
a cliff

113
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,660
yeah, you'd need a ten meter long barometer.

114
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,560
so much better to do it with millimeters of mercury.

115
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,280
and of course now we measure it in kilopascals.

116
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,160
So anyway, well done Nigel.  You really suck.

117
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,280
So how do we work out the maximum length of straw that you could suck through vertically?

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,700
Well think about this.  You place the straw into the liquid.

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
and you start sucking from the top.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
that decreases the pressure at the top

121
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
and the difference in pressure between your mouth and atmospheric pressure

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,720
creates a force that pushes the liquid upwards.

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,480
Now that liquid which is in the straw has a weight

124
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,080
which is equal to the volume of the liquid, times its density, times the gravitational field strength.

125
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,080
so if we set these two forces equal to each other

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,820
you can see that the pressure difference must be equal to the density of fluid

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,540
times its height, times the gravitational field strength

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
and if we sub in the numbers, we can see that the maximum height of liquid

129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,040
that anyone could lift, even if they created a perfect vacuum inside their mouth

130
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,340
would be about 10.3 meters.
