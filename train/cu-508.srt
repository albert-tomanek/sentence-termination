00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,030
The Second Trump-Kim Summit

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,200
Ended with no deal!

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,400
And that could be bad news...

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,440
for China.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,620
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,940

we publish a new, amazing episode.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,860
So, it’s the most anticipated blockbuster
sequel of the year!

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,360
No.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,460
I’m talking about The Trump-Kim Summit Part
Two.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,430
Perfectly balanced.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,780
And like any good sequel,

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,680
it’s been left wide open for a part three.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,940
Because Trump left the summit early,

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,040
with no deal on North Korean denuclearization.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,149
Now is that a bad thing?

20
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,890
Did Mr. Art of the Deal fail?

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,950
Well it turns out

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,550
there were much bigger things on the line.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,290
And President Trump quite likely had

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,899
another target in mind as well.

25
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,899
“CHINA!”

26
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,289
First, let’s talk about what actually happened
at the summit.

27
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,759
Then we’ll get to how China factors in.

28
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,969
Why wasn’t there a deal?

29
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,710
Trump said it was because North Korea

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,770
wanted all the sanctions lifted.

31
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,950
“Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted
in their entirety,

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,560
and we couldn't do that.

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
They were willing to denuke a large portion

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,979
of the areas that we wanted,

35
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,159
but we couldn't give up all of the sanctions
for that,

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,700
so we'll continue to work and we'll see.

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,119
But we had to walk away from that particular
suggestion.

38
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,579
We had to walk away from that.”

39
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,359
So basically, President Trump felt

40
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,460
he couldn’t get a good deal and walked away.

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,200
That’s important and I’ll get back to
that point in a moment.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,819
But after Trump’s remarks,

43
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,109
North Korean officials said that they only
asked

44
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,760
for a partial relief of the sanctions.

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,960
Yes, partial relief...

46
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,479
of all of the sanctions.

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,209
Now North Korean officials could be telling
the truth,

48
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,609
or they could just be trying to save face.

49
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,549
You know, “She didn’t break up with me,

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,840
I broke up with HER!”

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,140
But you might be wondering,

52
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,140
is Kim Jong-Un even willing to denuclearize?

53
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,140
According to Kim, yes.

54
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,560
“Chairman Kim, are you ready to denuclearize?”

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,580
“If I'm not willing to do that, I won't
be here right now.”

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,940
“That's a good answer.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:35,320
That might be the best answer you've ever
heard.”

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,420
Yeah, and how could you not trust a face like
this.

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,400
Trump, at least, says he does trust Kim.

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,299
“And one of the things importantly

61
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,280
that chairman Kim promised me last night

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,790
is regardless he's not going to do testing
of rockets and nuclear—

63
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,870
not going to do testing.

64
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,719
So, you know, I trust him,

65
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,879
and I take him at his word.

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,120
I hope that's true.”

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,719
But even if Kim agrees to stop testing nuclear
weapons,

68
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,560
there are fundamental disagreements

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,900
between the US and North Korea

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,870
on what “denuclearization” means.

71
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,819
North Korea would prefer it to mean

72
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,730
that they stop nuclear testing

73
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,470
and destroy *some* nuclear facilities,

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,140
but they get to keep all of their existing
nuclear weapons.

75
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,239
Sort of like a partial denuclearization.

76
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,049
Now, since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011,

77
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,519
he conducted at least 4 nuclear tests and
86 missile tests overall.

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,109
And those tests were setting the world on
edge.

79
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,670
But after Trump took office,

80
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,329
he started a yelling match with Kim.

81
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,060
And everyone was pretty sure this was going
to cause nuclear war.

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,400
But it turned out to be a war...of words.

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,159
Ahead of Trump’s first meeting with Kim
last summer,

84
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,469
“North Korea blew up tunnels at a nuclear
test site

85
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,200
and destroyed missile-testing facilities.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,969
After the summit, Kim stopped all missile
and nuclear tests,

87
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,340
honored the promise to return the remains
of U.S. troops,

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,260
and demolished frontline guard posts near
South Korea.”

89
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
So what happened?

90
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
What changed?

91
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,019
It wasn’t just Trump’s tough talk.

92
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,299
His administration put super serious economic
sanctions on North Korea,

93
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,519
and made China enforce them too.

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,389
These are the sanctions Kim now wants removed,

95
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,680
but Trump said, “Nah.”—

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,330
and walked away from this week’s summit
without a deal.

97
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,199
And this is where China comes in.

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,500
China is North Korea’s biggest ally.

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,770
And for a long time, China was the middleman—

100
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,020
so if the US or anyone else

101
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,120
wanted some kind of dialogue with North Korea,

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,980
they needed China.

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,340
For example, the Six-Party Talks from 2003
to 2013.

104
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,330
It was a series of meetings

105
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,680
aimed at getting North Korea to denuclearize.

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,370
China insisted on hosting the talks in Beijing.

107
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,600
And I can’t say the Chinese Communist Party

108
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,250
was the best middle man,

109
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,250
since the Six-Party Talks completely failed

110
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,080
to stop North Korea from building nukes.

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,530
But then Trump tried a different approach.

112
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,580
He forced the Chinese regime to enforce stiff
sanctions on North Korea.

113
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,699
How?

114
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,610
From early in Trump’s campaign,

115
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,770
he began threatening a trade war with China.

116
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,590
This headline is from 2016.

117
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,370
But he also indicated that he might be willing

118
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,169
to not start a trade war,

119
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,460
if China helped the US with North Korea.

120
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,160
It’s kind of like Trump was playing good
cop, bad cop...by himself.

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,849
So, he’s...both the good cop and the bad
cop.

122
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,250
Which confused the heck out of Chinese officials.

123
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,970
So Chinese leader Xi Jinping

124
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,720
went out of his way to treat Trump real nice.

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,889
He invited Trump to be the first American
leader

126
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,389
to dine in the Forbidden City.

127
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,610
And he treated Trump to a Peking Opera.

128
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,639
Trump was probably very happy...when that
was over.

129
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,020
But most importantly,

130
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,389
Xi Jinping agreed to Trump’s demand

131
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,639
that China put harsh sanctions on North Korea.

132
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,940
“In 2017, China’s strict implementation
of sanctions

133
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,610
has pushed North Korea back to the negotiation
table.”

134
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,960
And since Xi Jinping was so nice to Trump,

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,069
*surely* Trump would abandon his plans for
a trade war!

136
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,659
Fast forward to the first Trump-Kim summit
last June.

137
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,319
Trump gets Kim to back down,

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,280
solving the most immediate North Korean threat.

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,080
And since now there’s direct US-North Korea
dialogue,

140
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,479
it also cuts China out from being the middleman.

141
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,199
And then a few weeks later,

142
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,330
Trump launches trade tariffs on China.

143
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,000
Which, once again,

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,509
confused the heck out of Chinese officials.

145
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,080
What happened to good cop?

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,169
So, Trump used *threats* of a trade war

147
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,659
to get China to help bring North Korea to
the table.

148
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,070
And then once Trump no longer needed China’s
help with that,

149
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,569
he was free to launch the trade war that he’d
been threatening.

150
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,200
But that made Xi Jinping angry.

151
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,840
He really wears his emotions on his sleeve.

152
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,509
Anyway, Xi began meeting with Kim Jong-un
himself.

153
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,530
Kim has visited China four times since then.

154
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,330
He had never visited China before.

155
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,889
And when Kim traveled to the first US summit
in Singapore,

156
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,090
he had accepted Xi’s hospitality by flying
there

157
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,689
“on an Air China plane previously used by
Chinese senior leaders”.

158
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,319
And for *this* US summit,

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,120
Kim took his personal armored train through
China.

160
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,289
There’s two reasons for that.

161
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,770
One, according to a North Korean expert,

162
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,130
it’s because it makes Kim look slightly
less dependent on China.

163
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,639
But the other reason?

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,409
The Chinese regime allowed it

165
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:51,190
because it would take Kim on a ride near some
of China’s biggest cities,

166
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,180
to see the economic possibilities of sticking
with China.

167
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,939
You see, what Kim really wants is to make
North Korea the new China.

168
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,030
Yes, he wants North Korea to go from an isolated
hermit state

169
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,860
that persecutes its own people

170
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,509
and is shunned by the rest of the world,

171
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,699
to a prosperous modern state

172
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,360
that persecutes its own people

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,530
and is *celebrated* by the rest of the world.

174
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,130
Just like China.

175
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,539
Which could explain why Trump is also trying

176
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,139
to tempt North Korea with economic development.

177
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,229
“...we are all going to have a fantastic
success

178
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,310
with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea.

179
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,099
They are going to have an economic powerhouse.

180
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,510
I have been writing about it,

181
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,540
I have been talking about it,

182
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,500
I think it is going to be an economic powerhouse,

183
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,220
and something I very much look forward to
helping with.”

184
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,250
But here’s where things get interesting.

185
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,010
The sanctions have crippled North Korea.

186
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,390
Kim clearly wants those removed.

187
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,130
But Trump isn’t going to give that to him—

188
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,170
unless Kim makes bigger concessions on denuclearization.

189
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,700
So, according to the New York Times,

190
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,520
“Kim wants Beijing to urge the United Nations

191
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,770
to ease sanctions against North Korea.”

192
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,070
But it’s not very likely Beijing will help
with that.

193
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,220
Why?

194
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,540
Because now, the US is in the middle

195
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,170
of another a tough trade negotiation with
China.

196
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,650
This time, instead of threatening a trade
war,

197
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,870
there’s already a trade war.

198
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,040
And just before the Kim summit,

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,400
Trump extended the deadline to work out a
deal—

200
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,250
which actually leaves China not knowing what’s
going to happen.

201
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,690
Which yet again,

202
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,370
confuses the heck out of Chinese officials.

203
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,610
As one analyst put it,

204
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,130
“I don’t think China wants to cross Trump
at this point—

205
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,540
the price is too high considering the trade
deal.”

206
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,350
So this means China won’t fight the US

207
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,830
on North Korea sanctions right now.

208
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,810
The only option for the leaders of both countries

209
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,460
is to make a deal with the US.

210
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,710
And remember, Trump just walked away

211
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,380
from the North Korea summit

212
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,770
when he didn’t like what he was offered.

213
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,860
So China knows he’d be willing to walk away

214
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,250
from US-China trade talks too.

215
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,140
Sometimes bad cop gets things done.

216
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,930
So what do you think of the second Trump Kim
Summit?

217
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,500
Let me know in the comments below.

218
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,990
And before you go,

219
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,830
now is the time when I answer a question

220
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,760
from a member of my loyal 50-Cent Army—

221
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,880
fans who support the show through the crowd
funding website Patreon.

222
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,180
David Schwimmer asks,

223
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,390
“[Was] Putin... bribed to undermine the
west and democracy at China's behest?

224
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,140
Good question, David.

225
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,780
China and Russia do sometimes work together.

226
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,400
They even hold joint military drills.

227
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,540
And who could forget the time

228
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,750
that Xi Jinping gave Vladimir Putin

229
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,460
that fancy gold best friends forever necklace?

230
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,500
They look so...almost happy.

231
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,600
But as far as I know,

232
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
there’s no evidence that Russia

233
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,970
is undermining the west specifically at China’s
request.

234
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,440
Don’t get me wrong:

235
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,800
Russia *is* undermining the west.

236
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,910
Like when they tried to interfere

237
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,920
in the 2016 presidential elections.

238
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,460
But Russia has its own reasons.

239
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,750
It doesn’t need to be told what to do by
China.

240
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,020
For instance, Russia is facing a slow economic
and political decline.

241
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,000
And what better way to make yourself feel
better

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,930
than by making sure everyone else suffers
as well!

243
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,920
That, plus being seen with your shirt off.

244
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,020
Plus, as one Russian journalist told the Atlantic,

245
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,750
“The Kremlin was ‘very upset about the
Panama Papers,’

246
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,480
which cast light on Putin’s wealth.”

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,370
And of course the Chinese Communist Party—separately—

248
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,110
is doing plenty of its own things to undermine
the West.

249
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,170
We’ve done like 500 episodes on that,

250
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,390

to learn more.

251
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,670
