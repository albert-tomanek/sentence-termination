1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,990
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,420
Chinese propaganda—

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,820
now as American as apple pie!

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,280
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
Chinese propaganda.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,289
It’s not just for Chinese people anymore.

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,150
The Chinese Communist Party’s “official”
perspective on China

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,349
has infiltrated nearly every American home,

10
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:25,929
almost every major English language newspaper,

11
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,609
TV network, and radio station.

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,359
And it happened so quietly,

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,710
so gradually,

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,120
that almost no one saw it coming.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,399
Like the aliens.

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,719
They've been here all along.

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,719
Ahem.

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,969
In 2013, Chinese leader Xi Jinping

19
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,559
gave a speech at—

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
and this is what it was really called—

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,030
China’s National Meeting on Propaganda

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,539
and Thought Work.

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,840
Thought work?

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,100
Okay, come on,

25
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,100
now it's like you're not even

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,480
trying to hide it.

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,000
What did Xi go to next?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
The National Meeting on the Same Thing

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,949
We Do Every Meeting, Pinky-

30
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:02,150
Try to Take Over the World?

31
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,960
Anyway, at the “Thought Work” meeting,

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,210
Xi said China needs

33
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,070
“to strengthen media coverage…

34
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,430
and promote China’s views internationally.”

35
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,430
The Chinese Communist Party

36
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,570
now spends $10 billion dollars a year

37
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,670
to spread its propaganda overseas.

38
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,980
And it has three goals,

39
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,850
according to independent watchdog,

40
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,970
Freedom House:

41
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,641
One: To promote a positive view of China

42
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,250
and benign perspective of the CCP’s

43
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,780
authoritarian regime.

44
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,170
Two: To encourage foreign investment in China

45
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,540
and openness to Chinese investment abroad;

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,270
and Three: To marginalize, demonize,

47
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,100
or entirely suppress anti-CCP voices.

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
In other words,

49
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
the CCP’s goals are to

50
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,530
One: Paint a giant rainbow.

51
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,580
Two: Get foreigners to seek the pot of gold;

52
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,829
and Three: Suppress any rainbow experts

53
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,330
who point out the rainbow is fake.

54
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,330
So there are some obvious

55
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,969
Chinese propaganda methods—

56
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,430
and some very sneaky,

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,619
subtle ones.

58
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,619
The obvious:

59
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,460
An ad for state-run Xinhua News

60
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,600
in the middle of Times Square.

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,369
A waste of money, for sure.

62
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,179
Who cares about Xinhua?

63
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,019
I was looking at the ad for...

64
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:13,099
whatever she’s doing.

65
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,010
Then there’s the English China Daily

66
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,260
in newspaper boxes

67
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,600
all over major US cities.

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,709
But would you pay 25 cents to read about

69
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,629
how every country loves China?

70
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,629
And of course,

71
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,870
English state-run television.

72
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,260
It used to be called CCTV America.

73
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,720
But in 2016 they rebranded it as

74
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,690
“China Global Television Network”,

75
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,709
or CGTN.

76
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,980
But you can still tell what it is

77
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,090
by all their stupid panda coverage.

78
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,810
I think it's pretty clear now

79
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,900
why pandas are endangered.

80
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,599
But it's not just pandas.

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,739
Let's take a look at how CGTN covers

82
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,040
Tibetan buddhism.

83
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,440
The 11th Panchen Lama

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,610
is the spiritual leader of Buddhism

85
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,430
in China’s Tibet region.

86
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,110
As China is celebrating the 20th anniversary

87
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,480
of his enthronement,

88
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,940
he’s talked about some of the changes

89
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,330
he wants to make.

90
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,330
Hmmm,

91
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,910
I wonder what those changes could be.

92
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,440
The core values of socialism,

93
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,910
such as harmony, honesty, and equality,

94
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,269
have their corresponding concepts in Sutra.

95
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,860
Panchen of past generations

96
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,390
have been known for patriotism.

97
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,390
Wow!

98
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,440
Communism is just like Buddhism.

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,049
And to be a good religious leader,

100
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,159
you have to be loyal to the Communist Party.

101
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,880
Thanks, Panchen Lama.

102
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,939
And thanks, CGTN America,

103
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,500
for not mentioning how this Panchen Lama’s
“enthronement”

104
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,080
came after the Communist Party

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,080
kidnapped the actual Panchen Lama

106
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,810
and then replaced him with this kid,

107
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,920
who they then spent 20 years brainwashing.

108
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,659
Did you know CGTN is available

109
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,040
in a quarter of American households?

110
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,040
Now, there’s also that sneaky,

111
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,180
subtle kind of propaganda I mentioned.

112
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,080
It’s a strategy the CCP calls

113
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,099
“borrowing the boat to reach the sea.”

114
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,099
In other words,

115
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,120
putting state-sponsored propaganda

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,700
into Western media outlets

117
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,989
in a way that makes it feel like it’s

118
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,739
part of those outlets’ normal content.

119
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,560
For example, these paid advertising supplements

120
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,690
are designed to look and feel just like articles—

121
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,709
and then slipped into major US papers

122
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,000
like the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journal.

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,520
Not subtle enough?

124
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,570
How about how every day,

125
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,360
state-run media provides TV footage from China

126
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,420
for free through its news feed,

127
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,160
and through services like Reuters—

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,190
so that American media outlets can pick it
up.

129
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,110
For example, this NBC News video

130
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,590
shows footage of flooding in China...

131
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,780
And what do you know,

132
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,910
part of it is identical

133
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,840
to the state-run CCTV feed.

134
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,930
You can usually tell because

135
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,970
state-run media reports on China’s natural
disasters

136
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,900
focus heavily on how great the rescue efforts
are.

137
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
It sends the subtle message

138
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,770
that the CCP is here to help.

139
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,980
For a lot of China-related TV

140
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,960
news stories in the US,

141
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,540
most of the footage and information

142
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,620
comes from Chinese state-run media.

143
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,390
And there’s radio, too.

144
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,380
This Reuters investigation showed that

145
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,340
programming from state-run China Radio International

146
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,490
was being broadcast on radio stations

147
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,970
in 15 American cities—

148
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,550
because many stations were willing to allow

149
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,110
part ownership by Chinese companies

150
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,710
to make financial ends meet.

151
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,200
So the state-run propaganda

152
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,470
mostly covers the first and second goals

153
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,050
listed by Freedom House.

154
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,850
But what about the third goal?

155
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,550
You see, propaganda alone

156
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,410
isn’t enough to control the China narrative.

157
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,410
Because what about all those

158
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,810
pesky foreign journalists!

159
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,020
That’s where censorship comes in.

160
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,770
There’s a lot of obvious stuff.

161
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,770
Like when government thugs

162
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,280
stop media from reporting on something specific.

163
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,420
But more damaging is the self-censorship.

164
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,170
Like how journalists based in China

165
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,320
avoid reporting on certain sensitive topics,

166
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,760
for fear they could get kicked out of China
altogether.

167
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,320
Especially after the CCP made

168
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,320
an example out of Al-Jazeera’s Melissa Chan.

169
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
And of course,

170
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,780
sometimes editors are told to kill a story

171
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,940
to protect their company.

172
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,840
Yaar, dead articles tell no tales.

173
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,040
But they boost sales.

174
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,430
Which I believe is the sixth movie

175
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,690
in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

176
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,120
So the CCP is spending

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,170
$10 billion dollars a year on propaganda,

178
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,230
as well as implementing

179
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,810
widespread censorship pressure.

180
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,940
Why is this a big deal?

181
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,640
Because it’s severely misleading US companies,

182
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,790
government officials,

183
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,050
and average Americans

184
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,310
when it comes to making decisions on China.

185
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,950
The CCP says its economy is strong,

186
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,670
so US companies go there...

187
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,890
but often lose money.

188
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,360
The CCP boasts about its high-speed rail,

189
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,070
so US government officials think,

190
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,690
hey, it would be a great idea

191
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,920
to have the Chinese government invest in

192
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,730
high-speed rail projects in America.

193
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,490
Even though they sentenced their former railways
minister

194
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,810
to death...

195
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,710
after a kind of catastrophic

196
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,620
high speed rail crash

197
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,280
that they may have tried to cover up.

198
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,800
But one thing the CCP for sure covered up

199
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,840
was food safety hazards.

200
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,030
Which then literally killed puppies.

201
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,190
So yeah, not good.

202
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,690
But is there anything the US government

203
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,270
can do about the spread of Chinese

204
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,010
state-run propaganda in America?

205
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,210
Well the first thing they can do

206
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,710
is watch the situation closely.

207
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,660
Last year, Congress passed a bipartisan law

208
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,500
that would help the State Department

209
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,650
to work with experts to closely monitor

210
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,800
propaganda and disinformation

211
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,770
from the Chinese Communist Party.

212
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,310
They can also demand more transparency.

213
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,650
The FCC could implement rules

214
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,760
that require clear labeling of foreign government
ownership

215
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,220
of media outlets or of paid content

216
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,710
sponsored by foreign governments.

217
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,650
And they should review potential acquisitions

218
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,370
of US media companies by Chinese state-run

219
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,500
or affiliated companies.

220
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,860
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States

221
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,120
should have the power to stop these deals

222
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,930
if necessary.

223
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,860
So as we wait for the quick,

224
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,020
decisive action of the US government,

225
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,380
is there anything you can you do

226
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,530
in the meantime?

227
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,460
Well, keep your eyes peeled

228
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,400
for whether what you're watching or reading

229
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
is coming from Chinese state-run media.

230
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,590
Brands like these.

231
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,590
And maybe take those views

232
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,020
with a teeny, tiny grain of salt.

233
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,550
And when you’re reading or watching news

234
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,030
in American mainstream media

235
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,840
that have bureaus in China,

236
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,030
keep in mind that even though their reports

237
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,740
might be factually correct,

238
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,870
there’s a lot of important stories

239
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,050
they’re not covering.

240
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,050
And of course,

241
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,640
you should take a look at alternative

242
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,750
sources of information as well.

243
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,570
Like maybe a subversive comedy news program

244
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,570
that, I don't know,

245
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,970
uncensors China-related news.

246
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,970
So what do you think of

247
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,270
Chinese propaganda infiltrating

248
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,170
American hearts and minds?

249
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,820
Leave your comments below.

250
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,520
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored,

251
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,630
once again I’m your host, Chris Chappell,

252
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,800
see you next time.
