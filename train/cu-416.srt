1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,690
China readies its military

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,540
After Chinese leader Xi Jinping

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,430
Vows to take Taiwan

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,800
But the US may have a different idea.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,540
Plus...

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,700
I have a beard!

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,940
Welcome to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,360
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,340
The Chinese military is preparing for war.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,360
Again.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,060
In fact, for a country that hasn’t seen
real combat

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,820
since a brief war with Vietnam in 1979,

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,410
China seems to be preparing for war a lot.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,280
At least once a year it seems.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,960
I mean, it’s good to be prepared, right?

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,420
You never know when a war might sneak up behind
you

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,880
and suddenly happen through no fault of your
own.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,330
But these “preparation for war” headlines

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,399
aren’t necessarily that alarming by themselves.

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,190
After all, the US military talks about

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,070
combat readiness all the time,

22
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,900
which is essentially being prepared for war.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,260
But could there be any indication about a
specific war

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,600
that the Chinese Communist Party is possibly
getting ready for?

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,219
“Taiwanese independence would be a disaster.

26
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,110
Those are the words of Chinese President Xi
Jinping,

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,100
who made the comments in a speech on Wednesday
in Beijing.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,310
Taiwan is China's most sensitive issue

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,630
and is claimed as a breakaway province of
a ‘one China.’

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,630
And in his speech,

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,150
Xi said China will strive to lead Taiwan to

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,840
a bright future under Beijing's rule.”

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,110
Yes, the future looks bright for China and
Taiwan,

34
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,080
and unrelatedly, Xi Jinping called on the
PLA to,

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,330
you guessed it, prepare for war.

36
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,240
But I’m sure this preparing for war stuff
doesn’t have

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,340
anything to do with Xi’s speech on Taiwan.

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,840
Actually, it does.

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,759
It’s pretty much a warning.

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,150
Xi gave his speech about Taiwan

41
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,509
on the 40th anniversary

42
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,090
of the major change in China’s Taiwan policy.

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,290
In 1979, the Chinese Communist Party

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,470
stopped saying it would “liberate” Taiwan,

45
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,659
and instead said it would “peacefully reunify”
with Taiwan.

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,730
By force if necessary.

47
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,730
By the way,

48
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,299
even the word “reunification”

49
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,170
is a pretty clever propaganda term.

50
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,369
In Chinese, the term is actually “unification.”

51
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,900
But if you translate it as “reunification”

52
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,270
that makes it seem like Taiwan

53
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,109
was historically always a part of China.

54
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,510
Which is not true.

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,790
Now even though Xi’s speech

56
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,280
caused a lot of controversy,

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,400
it wasn’t technically a change

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,079
in the People’s Republic of China’s

59
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,349
current policy toward Taiwan.

60
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,879
In fact, the language was less harsh

61
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,169
than a speech Xi gave as last March,

62
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,790
when he said China was ready to fight

63
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,049
a bloody battle against its enemies.

64
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,680
And for the military to prepare for war…

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,290
which, again, he says ALL THE TIME.

66
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,669
But this year, he struck a different tone.

67
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,040
“Chinese people don't attack Chinese people.”

68
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,610
Which has been true exactly...

69
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,200
never, in Chinese history.

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,319
I mean...Mao.

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,809
Xi Jinping actually had lifted that line

72
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,689
from a 1995 speech about Taiwan

73
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,569
given by his biggest political rival,

74
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,900
former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,109
Which is kind of like Tupac lifting a line
from Biggie.

76
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,209
Look them up on Wikipedia.

77
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,569
There were also other goodies

78
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,999
sprinkled throughout Xi Jinping’s speech.

79
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,499
Like when he said China, quote,

80
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:19,199
“achieved a great victory in frustrating

81
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,430
the Taiwan independence movement

82
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,349
and other separatist activities.”

83
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,480
Which sounds to me like he wants bragging
rights

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,120
for illegally interfering in Taiwan’s recent
elections.

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,010
Now Xi’s not technically taking credit.

86
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,099
But I mean, if you want to give him credit...

87
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,709
Xi also mentioned the One Country,

88
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,829
Two Systems model a bunch of times.

89
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,180
That would mean Taiwan can become part of

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,069
the Communist People’s Republic of China,

91
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,559
but would still get to keep a degree of political
autonomy.

92
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,279
One Country, Two Systems.

93
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,619
It would be totally fine, Xi Jinping says.

94
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:56,989
“After peaceful reunification,

95
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,819
Taiwan will have lasting peace

96
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,349
and the people will enjoy good and prosperous
lives.

97
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,749
With the great motherland's support,

98
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,430
Taiwan compatriots' welfare will be even better,

99
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,220
their development space will be even greater,

100
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,339
they can stand more upright in the international
community

101
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,409
with more confidence,

102
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,329
they will be safer and they will have more
dignity.”

103
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,930
Yeah, just like Hong Kong!

104
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,669
The one country two systems policy is in action
there,

105
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,300
and it’s worked great!

106
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,069
Well, except for a few minor things,

107
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,870
like multiple pro-democracy figures being
harassed,

108
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,740
jailed, and kicked out of office.

109
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,860
Oh, and prominent foreign activists

110
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,919
being banned from visiting Hong Kong.

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,720
Oh, and a bunch of broken promises

112
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,790
about letting people there vote.

113
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,360
Plus Chinese state security spying on foreign
journalists.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,020
But otherwise, it’s great!

115
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,889
And yet, for some reason,

116
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,689
Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen

117
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,970
just doesn’t see it like that.

118
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,639
First, I must emphasize that

119
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,819
we have never accepted the "1992 Consensus."

120
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,229
The fundamental reason is because

121
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,509
the Beijing authorities' definition of the
"1992 Consensus"

122
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,620
is "one China" and "one country, two systems."

123
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,590
The speech delivered by China's leader today

124
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,130
has confirmed our misgivings.

125
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,300
Here, I want to reiterate that Taiwan

126
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,270
absolutely will not accept "one country, two
systems."

127
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,919
The vast majority of Taiwanese

128
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,770
also resolutely oppose "one country, two systems,"

129
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,479
and this opposition is also a "Taiwan consensus."

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,729
In fact, even though Xi Jinping’s speech

131
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,990
wasn’t a departure from Chinese policy,

132
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,220
Tsai responded with a public break from the
1992 consensus.

133
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,270
The 1992 consensus established that Taiwan
and China

134
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,449
both agree that there is only one China,

135
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,430
and that Taiwan is a part of it,

136
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,930
but each side has their own interpretation

137
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,949
of what “China” means.

138
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,039
Essentially, each side claims that

139
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,990
they are the one true China.

140
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,931
The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t mention

141
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,900
this whole “interpretation” part

142
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,650
when they talk about the 1992 consensus,

143
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,959
just the part where Taiwan agrees it’s part
of China.

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,959


145
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,680
Now since President Tsai was elected in 2016,

146
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,960
she had never openly acknowledged the 1992
consensus.

147
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,419
And her party, the DPP,

148
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,930
has historically not accepted it.

149
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,360
But now Tsai is actively and publicly rejecting
it.

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,289
She said, “I myself expect all of Taiwan’s
political parties

151
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,569
to clearly state, ‘We reject “one country,
two systems.’

152
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,009
And there’s no need to talk about the 1992
consensus anymore,

153
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,990
because this term has already been defined
by Beijing

154
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,400
as ‘one country, two systems.’”

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,630
And Taiwan is even now, well...preparing for
war.

156
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,770
Maybe you guys have more in common than you
think.

157
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,009
And it’s really breaking Xi Jinping up.

158
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,930
No wonder Xi Jinping said “Taiwan is so
close,

159
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,719
yet so far away.”

160
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:51,379
Xi Jinping just wants to reunify with you,
Tsai.

161
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,800
How can you be so cruel?

162
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,930
But not only has Tsai taken a stronger and
stronger stance

163
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,960
against the People’s Republic of China,

164
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,130
she’s also now calling out the international
community.

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,719
“When a country that does its best

166
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:07,360
to practice democracy and shared international
values

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,729
faces threats and violation,

168
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,099
I believe that this is also a violation of
democracy

169
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,770
and those values.

170
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,060
If the international community does not speak
out for

171
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,159
and support Taiwan while it is facing such
a situation,

172
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,750
we have to ask which country will be next.”

173
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,729
But while democracy and human rights is nice
and all,

174
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,870
don’t you know how much money China has?!

175
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,400
But even though the US has official diplomatic
ties

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
with the communist People’s Republic of
China,

177
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,139
the US has for decades also had strong,

178
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,349
unofficial, but positive ties with Taiwan.

179
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,409
Last November,

180
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,870
two US sailed two Navy ships

181
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,389
through the Strait of Taiwan,

182
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,750
a third time for the year.

183
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,840
Last year also saw the Trump Administration

184
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,770
setting up a 255 million dollar defacto embassy
in Taiwan.

185
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,319
And, on the last day of 2018,

186
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,249
Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act.

187
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,340
The section on Taiwan focuses on the US’s
commitment

188
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,830
“to counter efforts to change the status
quo

189
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,039
and to support peaceful resolution acceptable

190
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,330
to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.”

191
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,710
And to regularly sell weapons to Taiwan.

192
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,360
You know, in case anyone over there

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,889
decides to prepare for war.

194
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,349
So look out, Xi Jinping.

195
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,110
Because if you get too aggro,

196
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,570
you might just end up with Trump jumping in
the middle.

197
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,530
And things would get...interesting.

198
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,530
So what do you think?

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,949
Leave your comments below.

200
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:32,949
And before you go,

201
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:34,880
it’s the time you’ve all been waiting
for,

202
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,370
when I answer questions from a member of my
50 cent army,

203
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,800
fans who support China Uncensored

204
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,949
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

205
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,680
Lee Lhasa asks,

206
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,339
“Do you think under the present presidency
the US

207
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,399
would come to Taiwan’s aid in event of an
invasion?

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,800
Well, first of all,

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,680
I think it would be very difficult for China

210
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
to ever even launch an invasion of Taiwan.

211
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,260
But should it ever happen,

212
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,030
I’m fairly confident the United States would
get involved.

213
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,190
Decades of US policy has shown strong support
for Taiwan.

214
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,810
In a recent episode I talked about the island
of Kinmen,

215
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,680
which is only a few miles off the coast of
Mainland China—

216
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,670
but is administered by Taiwan’s government.

217
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,940
In the 1950’s, the Chinese military

218
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,380
actually bombarded the island,

219
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,930
specifically to see if the US

220
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,579
would actually get involved.

221
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,190
And the US did.

222
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,950
And as I mentioned, the Trump administration

223
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,320
has shown a lot of support for Taiwan,

224
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,410
and I think that will continue

225
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,519
despite the resignation of James Mattis,

226
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,040
who was a staunch supporter of Taiwan.

227
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,490
The real risk to Taiwan is a gradual

228
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,790
cultural and economic invasion.

229
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,910
The United States would be powerless

230
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,100
if the Chinese Communist Party were able to

231
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,040
successfully promote its interests in Taiwan

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,089
to the extent that there is

233
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,370
a strong enough force for unification

234
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,610
coming from inside Taiwan.

235
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,630
But remember,

236
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,350
even if Taiwan does someday get back together
with China,

237
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,649
that doesn’t mean that it’s the Chinese
Communist Party

238
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,470
that’s going to be in charge.

239
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,270
Thanks for your question, Lee.

240
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,140
