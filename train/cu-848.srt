00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,520
On this episode of China Uncensored...

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,480
"We are never ever getting back together"

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,100
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,860
Ah China, the world's growth engine.

5
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,259
At least according to top Chinese officials.

6
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:24,489
When western companies first went to China
it was like...

7
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:27,089
"Does this guy know how to throw a party or
what?"

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,130
But now...

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,229
"This Party's over."

10
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:33,359
Because a lot of US companies are planning
to leave China,

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,140
or have left already.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,820
That's according to the 2016 business climate
survey by the American Chamber of Commerce

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,649
in China.

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,989
"Our survey reflects that one in four companies
are moving operations."

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,249
Wow. One in four.

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:54,469
They surveyed 500 members that make up a representative
chunk of US companies operating in China.

17
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,909
The survey also found that, increasingly,

18
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,899
businesses are flatlining, in yellow, or losing
money, in red.

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,199
77% said they feel "less welcome" in China
than before.

20
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,250
Nearly 80% say they've been negatively affected
by China's Internet censorship.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,210
And perhaps one of the worst hit has been
the musical instrument insurance company,

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,140
Fallin' Gong.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,070
Now for years, China's economy has experienced
a meteoric rise.

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,439
"...the meteoric rise, the rapid growth of
China."

25
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,869
Which is weird,

26
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,340
because I'm pretty sure meteors don't rise.

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,960
But anyway, now the...rising meteor

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,399
is falling back down.

29
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,219
"China's economy is slowing.

30
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,409
This is a known fact."

31
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,070
Many experts think China's GDP growth data
is inflated

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,290
even entirely man-made.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,240
Oh, wait, sorry, it's not experts saying that

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,320
it's China's own Premier, Li Keqiang.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,869
More than half of American companies surveyed
said they're struggling with labor costs.

36
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,740
There are other problems, too.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,079
The biggest challenge companies say they face
is "inconsistent regulatory interpretation

38
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,750
and unclear laws."

39
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,159
Which I assume was a multiple-choice answer.

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,380
There are some other fun reasons to leave,
too.

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,790
52% of survey respondents say the risk of
getting intellectual property stolen

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,580
is greater in China compared to other places
they do business.

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,510
And 52% also say they've had trouble recruiting
senior executives

44
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,980
to work in China because of air quality issues.

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,860
So in summary, American companies are struggling
with paying people,

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,600
dealing with a legal system that has more
holes than Swiss cheese,

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,030
getting their stuff stolen,

48
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,040
and also they can't breathe.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,140
So for the one in four companies that have
left or plan to leave China,

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,230
where are they headed?

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,420
What's that, Shelley?

52
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,750
Not back to America??

53
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,000
Mostly, to other countries in Asia, like Vietnam,
Thailand, and India

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,130
--you know, so they can...

55
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,320
continue to exploit the low wages of developing
nations for their own profit.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,170
So there are lots of reasons, apparently

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,260
--even according to the bullish American Chamber
of Commerce--

58
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,390
not to do business in China.

59
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,910
And yet still, over half of the businesses
still consider China to be one of the top

60
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,500
three investment destinations.

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,420
They'll just do it with more "calculation
and caution."

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,380
Right. I think it's best put like this:

63
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,550
"Fool me once, shame on you.

64
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,580
Fool, can't get fooled again."

65
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,520
What do you think about US companies leaving
China,

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,970
and their reasons for doing so?
