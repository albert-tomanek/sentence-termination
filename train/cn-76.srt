1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Why might it have been called Sergeant Reckless?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,760
Did it s*** like a mister?

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,720
...no.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,320
That would be rather reckless.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,540
...no, it didn't. No.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,400
What, like a hippo spray? That kind of thing?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,780
Oh, don't — I've seen that.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,520
If you've never seen a hippo s***,

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,100
make your way to your nearest zoo and see a hippo s***.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm sorry, it is well worth —

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,520
Basically, a hippo -- going back to our word of the day, which is 'helical' --

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,940
has effectively got a propellor on its arse.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,700
Yes.

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,600
And will just kind of go
[flatulent noise]

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,120
...like that.

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,600
I've only been to a zoo once in my life...

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,960
Did it end with you kind of taking your glasses off,

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,020
and there being a perfectly glasses-shaped piece not covered in s***?

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,320
No, fortunately I was out of the splash zone.

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,200
Other people were *not* out of the splash zone.

21
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,680
But you were solidly in the guff zone.

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,160
It basically backed itself up against a window...

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,880
Beep... beep... beep...

24
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,580
No, no, no: thpppt... thppt... thppt...

25
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,240
Yep.

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,780
'Hippo reversing.'

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,520
Can you imagine being the bloke — we were talking about jobs like the army and whatever else —

28
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,780
can you imagine being the fellow at the zoo

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,360
whose job is to go in with the squeegee and the bucket to clean the s*** off the hippo window?

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,420
Whatever your job is at home, you're sat there going, 'God, I hate doing this.'

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,120
Just imagine being the fellow in the gumboots and smock

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,520
that has to walk into the hippo enclosure three times a day and go,

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,720
[Squeegee noises]

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,500
There you go. There's two elements:

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,860
One, you're dealing with a load of hippo s***.

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,960
Two, whatever you do, your work is only gonna bring joy to people

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,180
for a maximum of about an hour and a half

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,860
before that ungrateful bastard in the pen does it all over again.

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,680
What is it, two minutes and we've already got to s***?

40
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,700
Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
You're the one that brought in misted s***!

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,120
You are — I don't know where that came from.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,520
I don't know why that suddenly appeared, but that was all on you.

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,620
Well, I say, 'all on you'...

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,220
Atomized feculence, that's what you brought to the table.

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,820
That's a prog rock band if ever there was one.

47
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,660
First album: #1. Second album: #2.
