00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,450
the silver screen is turning red!

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,500
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,190
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,499
We’ve talked about it before,

6
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:18,859
that toxic wasteland spewing its pollution
around the world.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually, I’m talking about Hollywood.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,839
But Hollywood may have met its match in China.

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,999
By the end of next year,

10
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,050
it’s estimated that China may become

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,800
the world’s biggest movie box office.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,320
Yes, even bigger than the United States.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Moviegoers in China will pay an estimated

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,010
8.3 billion dollars by the end of this year.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,800
That’s just a few billion away from catching
up with the US.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,840
In fact,

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,039
Hollywood movies are now often made

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,739
with the Chinese market in mind.

19
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,000
Because if a studio wants its next major blockbuster

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,660
to take up a chunk of that multi-billion dollar
market,

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,149
it will have to play by the Communist Party’s
rules.

22
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,570
China allows only 34 foreign films a year.

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,190
Is it about protecting China’s own film
industry?

24
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,740
Mmm…partly.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,650
But it’s also about censoring ideas that
could,

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,650
you know,

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,940
undermine social harmony.

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,780
So what are Chinese censors looking for?

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,880
Well, just ask Party mouthpiece,

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Xinhua.

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,450
According to a draft

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,180
of China’s new film industry handbook,

33
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,300
people in the the film industry must have

34
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,320
“moral integrity.”

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
How do you do that?

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,140
“Practice core socialist values.”

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,350
If a Hollywood studio

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,380
wants to guarantee success in what

39
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
may soon be

40
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,520
the world’s biggest movie market,

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,530
that means censor yourself,

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,060
or get censored by the

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,480
State Administration of Press, Publication,
Radio, Film and Television,

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,260
or SAPPRFT.

45
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,150
But this is about even more

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,550
than just preventing Chinese people

47
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,490
from seeing movies that don’t adhere

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,920
to core socialist values.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,890
This is part of a concerted effort

50
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,820
by the Chinese Communist Party

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,530
to control what comes out of Hollywood.

52
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,979
They want to change the way Americans,

53
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,459
and the rest of the world,

54
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,210
think about China.

55
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,210
For more on this,

56
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,010
I sat down with National Security and Cyber
Espionage Expert,

57
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,340
Joshua Philipp,

58
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,140
who recently wrote this article in The Epoch
Times.

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,590
Thanks for joining us again, Josh.

60
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,170
The last time you were on the show,

61
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,719
you told us how China uses cyber espionage

62
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,829
to wage war on the United States.

63
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,390
And I couldn’t sleep for a week.

64
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,650
So tell me, why can I never enjoy a movie
again?

65
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,650
The Chinese Communist Party

66
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,010
has vast systems of forcing Hollywood to self censor,

67
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,040
or enticing them to co-produce films

68
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,599
alongside the Chinese Communist Party

69
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,510
so they have a direct hand in censoring the
films

70
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,430
during the production process.

71
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,569
Is this just to control what people see inside
of China

72
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,129
or does it affect us here?

73
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,079
It very much affects us here.

74
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,459
It ties back to what they call

75
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,459
culture warfare

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,129
but also what they call soft power.

77
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,409
This is altering the perception

78
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,859
of the Chinese Communist Party

79
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,230
and Chinese governance.

80
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,230
It’s—

81
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,230
you can’t show the Chinese Communist Party

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,870
in a negative light;

83
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,939
you can’t show the United States or the
US military

84
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,099
in a positive light.

85
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:22,599
Wait,

86
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,540
how do they make Hollywood not portray the
US positively?

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Well,

88
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,779
if the US creates a film

89
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,950
that shows the US military

90
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,069
or the United States in a positive light,

91
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,609
that film cannot be shown in China.

92
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,220
Really?!

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,400
And they lose the Chinese market because of
that.

94
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,400
So the film Captain Phillips,

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,269
I think with Tom Hanks,

96
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,320
that was banned in China,

97
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,660
because it showed the US military rescuing,

98
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,860
you know, one guy,

99
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,360
you know the US,

100
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,569
the United States mobilizing its entire military

101
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,569
to rescue one person,

102
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,400
which China would never do.

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
This encourages Hollywood studios

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,389
to never make a film showing the US government

105
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,389
in a positive light

106
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,569
because then that movie won’t get into the
China market,

107
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,870
which is going to be the biggest movie market
in the world.

108
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,390
So why make a moviethat won’t make a lot
of money?

109
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,499
Well and that’s the idea.

110
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,200
From the very get-go they need to think,

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,910
would we be willing to sacrifice doubling
our income, potentially,

112
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,180
or just remove this scene

113
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,790
that shows America in a positive light,

114
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,520
or just change the script around a little
bit

115
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,820
so it doesn’t show America positively

116
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,000
or doesn’t show China negatively.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,240
And this is the kind of thought process that
filmmakers

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,820
are putting into their movies from the very
get-go

119
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,230
and through the entire process.

120
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,180
And this is the environment of self-censorship

121
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,440
that China has created for the film market.

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,700
I always thought the reason China had those
censorship laws

123
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,430
was to control what people inside of China
see.

124
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,430
But really,

125
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,590
China, the Chinese government,

126
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,880
is doing this is to control what we in the
US see as well.

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
That’s right,

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
and this actually ties to more,

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,110
I mean kind of conniving, you know,

130
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,110
strategies they have.

131
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,930
The Communist Party conniving?

132
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,180
They directly call it ‘culture war,’ in
their own words.

133
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,560
Hu Jintao has used that exact phrase.

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,100
Sounds very cultured...

135
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,340
So has Xi Jinping as a matter of fact.

136
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,240
Nazi Germany did the same thing,

137
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,420
the Soviets did the same thing,

138
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,470
and China is now doing the same thing as well.

139
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,490
I’m going to be thinking about this every
time I see a movie now.

140
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,530
Do you enjoy making people feel horrible?

141
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,620
Well, if it's raising awareness about accurate issues,

142
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,510
I think people should feel horrible

143
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,300
when they realize films are being manipulated

144
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,090
with the intention of altering the way they
view the world.

145
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,170
Films are a core piece of the American identity.

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,760
Films are a common topic in conversations
with each other.

147
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,770
For a lot of us,

148
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,150
we quote films casually during conversations.

149
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,940
You’re sitting around with friends

150
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,010
you're going to quote a film or two 90% of
the time.

151
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,190
You’re tearing me apart.

152
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,620
If a government is manipulating these systems
of culture

153
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,110
for the purpose of altering the way we view
the world,

154
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,210
altering the way we view ourselves,

155
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,130
altering the way we view international issues,

156
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,240
I think it’s an issue of serious concern.

157
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,140
Thank you very much for joining us again today, Josh.

158
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,550
What do YOU think?

159
