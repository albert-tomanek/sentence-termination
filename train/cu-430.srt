1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,270
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,761
The Pope appoints new state-approved bishops
in China.

3
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:07,300
And they have a secret.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,380
The Chinese military is building a secret
new super gun.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,660
But they kinda want you to know about it,
too.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,260
And who says you can’t have a national ski
team,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,190
just because you don’t have any skiiers.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,570
Or snow.

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,940
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,279
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,150
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,910
Pope Francis is being praised by my favorite

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,760
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times,

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,780
for his wisdom.

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,309
That wisdom apparently involves

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,069
selling out Chinese Catholics

17
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:41,190
by giving in to the demands

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,579
of the atheist Chinese Communist Party.

19
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,850
According to a senior Vatican source speaking
to Reuters,

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,359
“A framework accord between the Vatican
and China

21
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,819
on the appointment of bishops is ready

22
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,850
and could be signed in a few months.”

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,649
We’ve covered how the Pope recently

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,350
asked two Chinese bishops to either retire

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,999
or step aside for two other bishops

26
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,239
approved of by the Chinese Communist Party.

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,239
And yes,

28
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,650
one of them had been excommunicated.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
But I guess he’s being...re-communicated.

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
And now, there’s a total of 7

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,280
Chinese state-approved bishops

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,210
the Pope is considering approving.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,920
Two of them apparently have families.

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,690
Look, I know what you’re thinking:

35
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,390
Catholic bishops aren’t supposed to be married.

36
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,760
Well, don’t worry.

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
They’re not.

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,380
They just have just mistresses.

39
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,410
And deep in the Pacific Ocean,

40
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,710
the Chinese regime is placing acoustic sensors.

41
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,060
They “could be used to study oceans”...

42
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,750
and definitely not anything else.

43
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,240
Those acoustic listening devices

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,050
are in no way related to the nearby

45
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,280
US military base in Guam.

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,930
Neither are they some kind of attempt

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,610
to track foreign ships.

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,490
So don’t even go there.

49
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,950
And in a totally unrelated matter,

50
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,780
the Philippines has changed its mind

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
about joint undersea exploration with China.

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,370
I mean yes,

53
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,920
the Philippines and China have competing claims

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,320
to territory in the South China Sea,

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,409
but this is a perfectly friendly decision.

56
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,319
But, you know,

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,519
the Philippines will also “chase off foreign
ships

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,900
conducting research in its territorial waters.”

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,370
Yeah, foreign ships.

60
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,650
From any country.

61
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,849
That includes China.

62
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,330
And in another a totally unrelated matter,

63
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,620
China might be testing the world’s first

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,980
ship-mounted rail gun.

65
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,560
A rail gun is an electromagnetic weapon

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,599
with the power to sink a warship

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,569
and the precision to shoot down a satellite.

68
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,920
For scientific purposes of course.

69
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,040
The US is also testing rail guns.

70
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,599
Those can fire a round at about 5,000 miles
per hour

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,779
hitting a target almost 100 miles away.

72
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:55,750
The catch—each round costs about million
dollars.

73
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,120
But rail guns aren’t the only weapons that
are a threat.

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,730
North Korea is now just a few months away

75
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,280
from being able to hit the US with a nuke.

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,900
And it seems nuclear proliferation

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
is making a comeback everywhere!

78
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,680
I read it in the New York Times Style section.

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,859
According to U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert
Wood,

80
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,989
China and Russia are also pushing nuclear
development.

81
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:20,989
You get a nuke!

82
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:21,989
You get a nuke!

83
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,489
Everybody gets a nuke!

84
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,030
This comes shortly after a statement by the
Pentagon

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,249
that China and Russia are becoming a greater
threat

86
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:32,959
than Islamic terrorism.

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,959
But the Pentagon is known

88
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,459
for making the occasional snafu.

89
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,849
In a report about the China nuclear threat,

90
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,769
they may have referred to Taiwan

91
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,290
as a part of China…

92
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,919
Let’s just hope they don’t nuke the wrong
country...

93
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,309
slash region.

94
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:52,590
And Mercedes-Benz has also just made a huge
mistake.

95
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,169
They published an Instagram post with a quote

96
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,949
from that “wolf in monk’s robes,”

97
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,310
the Dalai Lama.

98
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,739
In response, Chinese state-run media

99
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,099
decided to maintain a dignified silence

100
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,520
on the issue.

101
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,620
Just kidding.

102
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,520
Again.

103
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,500
They called Mercedes an enemy

104
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,139
of the Chinese people.

105
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,819
After an outcry from Chinese customers,

106
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,370
Mercedes apologized.

107
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,850
Twice.

108
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,340
They also replaced the ad with this new one.

109
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,890
What’s that, Shelley?

110
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,540
That’s not a real Mao quote?!

111
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I guess Mercedes-Benz

112
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
is going to have to issue

113
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,730
a third apology.

114
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,730
In other news,

115
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,560
Sweden has been having bad luck

116
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,750
when it comes to keeping its citizens

117
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,120
from being abducted by Chinese authorities.

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,930
So the Swedish government has taken a novel
approach

119
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,710
that no one else seems to try anymore.

120
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,230
Calling China out.

121
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,720
They’re condemning the brutal detention
of Gui Minhai,

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,090
who is a Swedish citizen.

123
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,980
This is what Sweden’s foreign minister had
to say:

124
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,250
“Mmm bork bork bork!”

125
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,940
Truly scathing words.

126
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,720
Ok, the foreign minister called it

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,630
a “brutal intervention”

128
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,900
and demand Gui Minhai be released.

129
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,090
Gui Minhai was “picked up by plainclothes
agents

130
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,440
on January 20th as he travelled on a train
to Beijing

131
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,370
with two Swedish diplomats.”

132
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,580
I feel like the diplomats should have intervened.

133
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,840
But I guess that wouldn’t have been

134
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,670
very diplomatic, would it?

135
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,080
Gui Minhai was one of the Hong Kong booksellers

136
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,790
who had in the past been detained for publishing

137
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,410
controversial books about Chinese leader Xi
Jinping.

138
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,230
He spent two years in detention,

139
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,520
even though—again—

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,020
he is a Swedish citizen.

141
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,620
The Chinese Communist Party

142
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,440
doesn’t really recognize dual citizenship.

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,930
And finally, do you like skiing?

144
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,250
Doesn’t matter.

145
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,380
When the government calls on you

146
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,400
to like something,

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
you had better like it!

148
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,020
The Chinese Communist Party has decided

149
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,360
China should do better in the Winter Olympics,

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,420
since it’s going to be held in Beijing

151
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,800
just four years from now.

152
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
So the Party is pushing

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,020
“300 million people into winter sports by
[2022]

154
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,120
with at least 800 ski resorts,

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,640
nearly double the current number.”

156
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,220
And if there’s no snow on those mountains—

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,210
because it barely snows in Beijing—

158
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,210
no problem!

159
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,390
They’ll just load it up with fake snow.

160
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,580
Because even though skiing is just a sport,

161
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,920
that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be

162
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,930
miserable doing it.

163
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,570
That’s this week’s biggest China headlines!
