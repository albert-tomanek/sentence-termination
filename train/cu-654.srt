1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,680
Is China America’s Mortal Enemy?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,760
What is Zoom doing with your data?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
And Chinese military aggression ramps up

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m\h
Chris Chappell. YouTube has been\h\h

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,440
secretly unsubscribing people again, so make\h
sure you’re subscribed, smash that like button,\h\h

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,960
and check back often. Because YouTube probably\h
isn’t telling you when we have new episodes.\h

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
Merry Christmas. China is America’s mortal enemy.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
At least, according to White\h
House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,640
This is a strategic rival, but it is also\h\h

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,440
increasingly a mortal enemy. They're coming\h
at us Pete. In so many different ways.\h

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
I think he means that they\h
were already a mortal enemy,\h\h

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,000
like Scorpion. But now they’re an\h
even scarier mortal enemy, like Goro.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,920
But what kind of different ways is China\h
coming at the US? Well, let’s have a look.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,760
You might have heard of an app called Zoom.\h
You’ve most likely used it to replace normal\h\h

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,960
human interaction, thanks to the coronavirus\h
pandemic, that the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,600
is responsible for. And it turns out, Zoom\h
has been working very closely with Beijing.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,800
Federal prosecutors are accusing a Zoom\h
executive of working with Chinese government\h\h

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,600
to surveil users and suppress video calls.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Zoom says they deliver happiness.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,960
That motto is a lie. Whenever we use\h
Zoom, all of us are deeply unhappy.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Especially if you worked with this guy.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,280
But you know who is happy? Zoom CEO Eric\h
Yuan, who’s now worth 3 billion dollars.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,440
But when prosecutors accuse a Zoom executive\h
of working with the Chinese government,\h\h

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
they don’t mention CEO Eric Yuan.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,160
Instead, they allege a China-based\h
executive with Zoom named Xinjiang Jin,\h\h

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
“worked with the Chinese government\h
to terminate Americans’ accounts and\h\h

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,200
disrupt video calls about the 1989 massacre of\h
pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square”.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,880
You might remember this because\h
it was a big scandal back in June.\h\h

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,080
We interviewed Tiananmen activist Zhou\h
Fengsuo, whose Zoom meeting was shut down.\h

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,120
Zoom at the time said it was just following\h
local laws. But that’s not all that Jin did.\h

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
The Zoom executive “monitored Zoom’s video\h
system for discussions of political and\h\h

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,120
religious topics deemed unacceptable by China’s\h
ruling Communist Party, the complaint states,\h\h

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
and he gave government officials\h
the names, email addresses\h\h

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,000
and other sensitive information of\h
users, even those outside China.”

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,160
That’s right, he sent user data from outside\h
China to the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

37
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,160
This is something that Zoom\h
publicly said it did not do.\h

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,040
But it gets worse. On top of that lie, Jin also\h
worked with Chinese police and state security\h\h

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
to create fake evidence to\h
get these users banned.\h

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,600
What kind of fake evidence? Oh you know,\h
things like they were involved in terrorism,\h\h

41
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,320
inciting violence, and of\h
course, child pornography.

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,680
And the Chinese Communist Party also used the\h
data that Zoom gave them to detain at least\h\h

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
one dissident and threaten the\h
family of another dissident.\h

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,920
I’m guessing those people don’t feel\h
like Zoom really delivered happiness.\h\h

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
More like delivered a crackdown\h
from an authoritarian regime.\h

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,800
So what is Zoom doing now? Well, it’s clear from\h
the criminal complaint that Jin was working with\h\h

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,640
other Zoom employees in the US to ban\h
users and meetings. So Zoom fired Jin\h\h

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,440
and put other employees on leave, and they say\h
they’ve launched an internal investigation.\h

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,760
Zoom has pledged to do better, but at the\h
same time the company is still minimizing what\h\h

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,240
happened. For example, Zoom says that they did not\h
provide the Chinese government with the user data\h\h

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,560
of non-China users…”with the exception of user\h
data for fewer than ten individual users.”

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah we totally didn’t give the Chinese\h
Communist Party user data except for when\h\h

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,840
we did. But let’s not focus on that part.\h
Did we mention that we deliver happiness?

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
So you can see why Trade Advisor Peter\h
Navarro says China is coming after us in\h\h

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,840
so many different ways. More came out\h
this week than just the Zoom fiasco.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
The Chinese regime has been engaging in mass\h
surveillance of Americans’ mobile phones.\h\h

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,640
That’s according to a new report by Exigent\h
Media, a Washington based cyber security firm.

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
They found state-owned\h
telecom operator China Unicom,\h\h

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,640
was the leading source of attacks against U.S.\h
mobile users over 3G and 4G networks in 2018.

60
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,840
So clearly, the only solution is—Huawei 5G.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
But if this is mortal Kombat\h\h

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,920
the US is fighting back. Hey, Mortal\h
Kombat prepared us for the coronavirus!

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Last week, the US added more than 60 Chinese\h
military linked companies to a blacklist.\h

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,040
The Commerce Department points to\h
“China’s military-civil fusion”.

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,920
That’s basically a new policy in China that\h
means any so-called private company in China\h\h

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,520
has to turn over the goods to\h
the Communist Party’s military.

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
Meaning, there’s no such thing\h
as a private company in China.

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
And for more on how the Chinese Communist\h
Party controls everything in China,\h\h

69
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
stay tuned after this short break.

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,840
Welcome back.

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,160
The Chinese Communist Party controls\h
all aspects of Chinese society.\h\h

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
And the Party is more than\h
happy to have the people\h\h

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,560
make some sacrifices on the Party’s behalf.\h
I’m sure it’s what the people would want.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
Millions are having their electricity rationed.

75
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
Entire cities have gone dark.\h\h

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,920
“Officials in at least three provinces—where a\h
total of more than 150 million people live—have\h\h

77
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,960
issued orders limiting energy use,\h
warning of potential coal shortages.”

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,320
Wow, that’s rough. Maybe the Party shouldn't\h
have banned coal imports from Australia?

79
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
Power shortages will obviously\h
make a lot of Chinese people angry.\h\h

80
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,840
But the Communist Party knows how to take\h
care of that. By distracting them with war!

81
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Chinese jets joined Russia in entering\h
South Korea’s air defense zone.

82
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
This isn’t entirely new. “In July last year,\h\h

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,760
South Korean warplanes fired hundreds\h
of warning shots toward Russian military\h\h

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,960
aircraft on a joint air patrol with China,\h
when they entered South Korean airspace.”

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,600
China has denied any wrongdoing. Because invading\h
other countries’ airspace feels so right.

86
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,040
And why have one battle\h
front when you can have two?\h\h

87
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Taiwan had to scramble ships and aircraft\h
as a Chinese carrier passed by the island.

88
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
“Taiwan’s ministry said\h
that six warships and eight\h\h

89
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,640
air force aircraft were sent to ‘stand guard’\h
and monitor the Chinese ships’ movements.”

90
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,040
Alright, this game isn’t fun anymore.

91
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,520
Considering how openly hostile the\h
Chinese Communist Party is becoming, it’s\h\h

92
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,960
not that surprising to hear that Japan\h
has approved a record military budget,\h\h

93
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,920
with new stealth jets and long range missiles.

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,760
And this is also interesting because it\h
shows that current Japanese Prime Minster\h\h

95
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,360
Yoshihide Suga is continuing the hard line\h
approach of his predecessor Shinzo Abe.

96
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Japanese military expansion is controversial\h
in Asia because...remember Japanese aggression\h\h

97
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,600
ahead of World War II? But the possibility of\h
Chinese Communist aggression in World War III\h\h

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,720
might be a little more pressing\h
to countries in the region now.

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Now over to Canada. Earlier this year,\h\h

100
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,640
a Chinese company made an attempt to buy a gold\h
mine in Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost province.

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Weird, because the current price\h
of gold makes that goldmine\h\h

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,640
unprofitable. But..the mine just happens to\h
be close to a useful arctic shipping port.\h\h

103
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,000
And also just a few hundred\h
miles from a NORAD base.

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,840
But good news: This week the Canadian government\h\h

105
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,320
blocked the takeover of the Nunavut\h
gold mine on national security grounds.

106
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,960
I guess they were having “none of it.”

107
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,160
This high quality humor is why\h
you watch China Uncensored.\h\h

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
And if you want to learn more about\h
what’s happening with Canada and China,\h\h

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,520
watch our next China Uncensored episode.\h
I’ll be “Poutin” it on this channel Monday.

110
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,920
Admit it. You love me.

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Things aren’t looking good\h
for Chinese tech giants.\h\h

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,400
You may remember last month when China\h
blocked the IPO of Ant Financial.

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
That was after Ant Financial founder Jack Ma\h\h

114
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,800
mouthed off about his displeasure\h
toward Chinese regulators.

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,600
Which is why Xi Jinping saw it personally\h
that Ant Financial’s IPO would be blocked.

116
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,400
That led to concerns the Communist Party would\h
start a major crackdown on tech companies.\h\h

117
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,560
And... it’s happening.\h

118
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,400
That includes Alibaba and Tencent. This\h
is on top of anti-monopoly guidelines\h\h

119
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,840
the Party made last month targeting\h
some of these major tech companies.\h

120
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
And now, Jack Ma is singing\h
a slightly different tune.\h

121
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,760
Because, say it with me—there\h
is no private business in China.

122
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,760
And now I’ll answer a question from one of you,\h\h

123
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,200
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,800
Logan asks, “Any luck finding a merchandise\h
store yet? I want a Xi the Pooh shirt.”

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
Oh, you mean you want a t-shirt with this on\h
it? I’m hoping a lot of you watching would\h\h

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
like a t-shirt like this. We were selling this\h
shirt earlier in the year on Teespring, but\h\h

127
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
they permanently shut us down. Imagine that.\h

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,320
But many of you suggested we reach out\h
to Bunker Branding for merchandise.\h\h

129
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,960
And I’m happy to say that is moving forward!\h
Sadly we missed the Christmas rush, but\h\h

130
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,840
very soon, we will finally be\h
offering merchandise. So stay tuned!

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,840
And as always a big shout out to everyone who\h
supports China Uncensored on Patreon. With\h\h

132
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,760
YouTube demonetizing us and randomly unsubscribing\h
people, we would have had to shut the show down if\h\h

133
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,960
it weren’t for your support. If you’d like to join\h
what I call the China Uncensored 50 cent army,\h\h

134
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,160
head over to Patreon.com/ChinaUnensored\h
to learn how you can support the show.

135
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
And in case you think we missed something big in\h
this episode, we actually recorded it two days\h\h

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,960
ago so Seamus didn’t have to video edit over\h
Christmas. The Chinese Communist Party often\h\h

137
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,560
does horrible things right around Christmas\h
so that the Western media don’t cover it.\h\h

138
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,240
If that happened this year, you’ll just have\h
to wait till next week to hear about it.

139
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:27,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell. Merry\h
Christmas to all, and to all, a good night.
