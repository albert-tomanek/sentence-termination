1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,760
I call it the “Hug A Nazi, Make a Liberal”
Theory.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,040
That theory just doesn’t work.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,659
And instead, what we’ve done is enrich and
empower

4
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,319
a clique of dictators in China.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,300
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,180
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,470
Dana Rohrabacher has been a US congressman

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,510
from my home state of California

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,050
since 1989 -

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,660
the year of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,170
He criticized the Chinese Communist Party
then,

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,079
and does now, too.

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,800
In fact, he’s one of a tiny handful of US
congress people

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,010
willing to raise the most taboo issues, the
ones

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,489
that the Communist Party absolutely does not
want the public

16
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,710
to talk about.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,219
President-elect Trump has considered Rohrabacher
for a position

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,149
in the US State Department.

19
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,829
Also, he’s a folk singer and surfer.

20
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,550
So naturally, I came to Washington, DC

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,089
to sit down with Congressman Rohrabacher.

22
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,510
Thank you for joining me today, Congressman
Rohrabacher.

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,290
You’ve been a congressman since 1989, and
in that time

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,910
you’ve been very vocal about China issues.

25
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,880
Why should Americans care about what happens
in China?

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,220
Well China, as a country that’s being controlled

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,210
by people who hate the American way of life

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,670
is a potential problem

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,170
if not a potential threat - an enemy.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,730
A China run by a more democratic country,

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,700
that is more in tune with its own people,

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,050
that isn’t trying to be belligerent or militaristic

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,790
is really a positive force in the world,

34
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,280
and positive for America.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,050
If the Chinese people are free,

36
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,640
and if the Chinese people have their rights
be protected

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
by their own government,

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,310
that’s actually good for America as well.

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,820
That’s why we should be on the side, there
in China,

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,980
of people who would like a more democratic
and open system.

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,020
A more accountable system.

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,340
Instead of being run by a bunch of gangsters
that will put you in jail

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,340
and cut you open and steal your organs

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,060
and sell them for profit.

45
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,810
Hey, the Communist Party denies that any of
that’s happening.

46
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,010
I’m sure.

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,310
Ever since Bill Clinton pushed for granted
China

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,600
Most Favored Nations trade status,

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,890
most politicians have followed the strategy
of:

50
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,470
Step 1: Make China rich

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,890
Step 2:

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,700
Step 3: Democracy!

53
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,319
Why hasn't that worked?

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,740
Well, the idea that you’re going to increase
the

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,370
wealth and power of people in a government,

56
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,680
and that will somehow make them more humane,

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,010
and more democratic,

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,390
it’s a longing that people have,

59
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,350
and obviously it hasn’t worked in China,

60
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,459
and I don’t think I’ve seen it ever have.

61
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,030
I call it the “Hug A Nazi, Make a Liberal”
Theory.

62
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,310
That theory just doesn’t work.

63
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,959
And instead, what we’ve done is enrich and
empower

64
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,849
a clique of dictators in China.

65
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,780
And they’re actually more of a threat now

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,270
that they’re wealthy and have wealth at
their command,

67
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,860
than they were when they were poor!

68
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,830
And it’s a mistaken notion that people reject
democracy

69
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,459
because they are poor people.

70
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,860
And the fact is,

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,640
even in the communist era,

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,770
that’s just not the way it was.

73
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:46,030
You often speak about things like human rights
abuses,

74
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,450
which make the Chinese Communist Party feel
bad.

75
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,239
How do you expect China to engage with us
if you keep

76
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,620
hurting the feelings of the Chinese people?

77
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,510
Unfortunately, that argument is being made

78
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,650
that we should try our best not to

79
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,520
enrage the butchers in Beijing.

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,370
I think, basically, we need to make sure that
we

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,470
penetrate that ring and don’t try to make
friends

82
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,570
with the clique that’s running this control.

83
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,850
But instead reach out to the people themselves

84
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,930
and say “we’re on your side.”

85
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,570
And we’re not on the side of this clique

86
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,590
having an iron-fisted grip on you

87
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,230
and the rest of your society.

88
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,850
What are some of the most taboo issues that

89
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,230
the Chinese Communist Party doesn't want American

90
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,680
officials like you to talk about?

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,560
I think the harvesting of organs from prisoners
-

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
especially prisoners who have been arrested

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,100
because of their religious convictions,

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,210
or other types of things - their writings.

95
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,360
But in terms of the Falun Gong,

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,250
people who believe in meditation,

97
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,430
people who believe in self-help,

98
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,610
people who have standards,

99
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,280
humane and valued standards -

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,600
putting them in jail and killing them for
their organs

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,700
has got to be one of the most heinous crimes
on the planet.

102
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,889
And this is literally taking saints -

103
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,600
we should encourage people to have those values

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,520
around the world, including the United States.

105
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,840
The meditation, the actual seeking truth

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,680
and seeking to be in harmony with the world
and with others -

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,430
We should encourage those types of values.

108
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,940
And killing people like that,

109
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,990
and especially, then,

110
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,630
to add the worst kind of insult,

111
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,300
killing people like that,

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,449
and then taking their body parts

113
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,199
in order to make money

114
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,840
to sustain their tormentors.

115
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,250
To sustain the iron grip on their lives.

116
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,370
That is the worst of all tyrannies that I
could see.

117
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,410
There are reports that you are a potential
candidate

118
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,110
for Secretary of State.

119
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,699
If you get the job,

120
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,930
what would your China policy look like?

121
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,139
Well my China policy would be

122
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,350
whatever President Trump wants the China policy
to be.

123
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,759
And that’s the first thing we have to note.

124
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,750
But I can tell you what I would recommend.

125
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,150
And what I recommend is that when people,

126
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,979
when there are high-level meetings between

127
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,460
Chinese officials and American officials,

128
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,290
that we also make it a point

129
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,750
to bring up human rights issues.

130
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,070
And if any American diplomat goes to China,

131
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,610
which they would,

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,990
that part of that visit would visiting

133
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,600
people whose humans rights are being violated,

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
people who are under attack,

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,090
so that people know,

136
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,870
yes, we recognize the people in power,

137
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,060
but we also sympathize with others.

138
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,300
For the last 8 years,

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,330
every time there’s been a meeting with

140
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,550
heads of state,

141
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,889
our president has not pushed that point at
all.

142
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,910
And so I think it should be part of the agenda

143
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,560
to discuss, and also if someone,

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,110
if our diplomats go there,

145
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,040
our elected officials go to China,

146
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,380
they should actually make it a point

147
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,100
to go visit someone who is a dissident.

148
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,700
I understand you once arm wrestled Russian

149
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,949
president Vladimir Putin

150
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,539
to decide whether America or Russia won the
Cold War.

151
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,290
Would you arm wrestle Xi Jinping?

152
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,550
No, because I just had my shoulder replaced.

153
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,360
And I think that I would need

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,050
to make sure I’m ready for that fight.

155
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,090
I’m afraid my shoulder’s not ready for
it.

156
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,520
If the opportunity happens, I’m there for
you.

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,320
I understand you hurt your shoulder

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,940
from a little too much surfing?

159
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,660
That was it.

160
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,490
When I was younger,

161
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,050
I was not told that this was gonna

162
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,050
wear away your shoulder cartilage.

163
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,220
But that’s part of freedom, you know.

164
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,699
They say, “well 25 years of surfing

165
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,810
gave you that arm.”

166
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,539
Would you do it again?

167
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,980
Well, yeah - sure I would!

168
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,670
That’s a vote for surfing.

169
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,169
Surfing is great.

170
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,360
Freedom is great.

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,640
People there, and the Falun Gong,

172
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,670
they’ve opened their senses

173
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,170
to being able to experience what life is about
to them

174
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,360
and the universe…

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
Well, as a surfer,

176
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,960
I sort of did it that way.

177
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Didn’t go through the other provisions

178
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,459
that would make me Falun Gong.

179
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,460
I just did it on the surfboard.

180
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,570
Sounds pretty good to me.

181
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,360
So you have praised president-elect Trump

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,411
for taking the phone call from Taiwanese president

183
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,780
Tsai Ing-wen because it showed China

184
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,970
that he wasn't a pushover.

185
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,750
Are there other things that Trump could do

186
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,240
to show China that he isn't a pushover?

187
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,250
Well, the first thing he could do, for example,

188
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,160
I would suggest that he

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,380
make sure that he visibly has someone association
with

190
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,100
people who are pushing

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,540
for more of a democratic China.

192
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,600
We could also send a message that,

193
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,320
certain business rules of the game have changed.

194
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,630
He could propose that.

195
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,540
And the Chinese will get the message.

196
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,089
Are you concerned that standing up to the
Chinese regime

197
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,910
could make it harder to work with China?

198
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,980
Yes, I am.

199
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,320
We have to understand that there’s nothing
for free

200
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,330
in this world.

201
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,850
And I would predict,

202
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,830
knowing the nature of tyrants and gangsters,

203
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,890
the stronger you are with them,

204
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,950
the broader the area of cooperation will be

205
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,450
because they know respect you,

206
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,470
and know that they can’t go beyond this.

207
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,300
And so, however, you’re risking a breakdown.

208
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,540
And frankly, a breakdown in relations that
we have

209
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,420
may hurt our business community.

210
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,920
But quite frankly,

211
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,940
the business community should understand

212
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,519
their well-being is less important

213
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,459
than the security of the United States.

214
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:50,810
And in the long run,

215
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,750
we need to have a more democratic China.

216
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,480
That should be our goal.

217
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,390
Do you think there’s a risk of a trade war?

218
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,390
Trade war?

219
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,080
Trade war benefits us!

220
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,260
Why?

221
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,840
It benefits us because,

222
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,790
if we have unequal trade agreements with China

223
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,880
that facilitates the flow of wealth to come
in this way,

224
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,360
If we have a dispute over the basic rules,

225
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
that flow of wealth,

226
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,130
it’s not gonna come from here to there.

227
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,149
That flow of wealth will stay in the United
States.

228
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,089
Congressman Rohrabacher, thank you for joining
me today.

229
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,490
I have one final question:

230
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,450
Who do you think won this interview?

231
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,089
I would have to say,

232
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,970
I think the people who believe in freedom

233
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,340
won this interview.

234
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,220
I think there’s only one way to decide…

235
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Next up is Putin!

236
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,680
Thank you again, it was a pleasure.
