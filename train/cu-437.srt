1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,501
A Chinese man in lockdown

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,779
posted about starving for 10 days

3
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:13,420
Now he’s been jailed for 10 days.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,990
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,750
Tonghua, China: A small city you’ve probably
never heard of in China’s northeastern Jilin

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,060
Province.\h

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,580
And by small city, I mean it has 2.3 million
people.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,160
Tonghua is part of China’s rust belt.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,310
Basically it’s China’s Detroit, but even
worse.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,850
And with 3 times as many people.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,070
And thanks to the coronavirus, aka the CCP
Virus, things there are going badly.

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,309
Like starvation level badly.

13
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,860
The city has been under lockdown since mid
January.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,899
And not like “oh no, we can’t go to the
gym” kind of lockdown.

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,699
Like “stay in your apartment, don’t go
outside under any circumstances” kind of

16
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:05,699
lockdown.

17
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:12,420
In January, after 49 residents tested positive
for Covid, “a downtown section of the city

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,790
became the most locked-down place in China.

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,560
City officials taped apartment doors shut
in entire housing complexes practically overnight.”

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,500
Here’s part of what one resident who goes
by Mr. Liu posted on the social media platform

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,840
Toutiao.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,630
“I’ve starved for nearly ten days.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,619
Luckily a kind person had shared some food
with me, but that was 3 days ago.”

24
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,670
“The whole city has been restricted from
leaving without any prior notice.

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,390
My building’s been quarantined for ten days,
with no food, nothing.”

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:57,899
“I support the country, I support the government,
but please hurry and provide emergency relief!

27
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,240
Truly too many people are starving.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
I’m nearly starved to death.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,820
I’m not exaggerating!

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,179
They only care to protect their officials,
but don’t even care to provide food for

31
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,200
the sake of their public image!”

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,480
“I hope this post can reach the attention
of the county leadership!

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,780
Thank you everyone!

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,310
I take full responsibility for my words!”

35
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,200
The Public Security Bureau in Tonghua City
responded by posting a screenshot of that

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,489
social media post with the word “FAKE”
stamped across it.

37
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,499
And then, to help Mr. Liu, who’d been starving
for 10 days...they put him in jail for 10

38
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,559
days.

39
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,620
Why?

40
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,069
Well according to the police, he was lying.\h\h

41
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:50,569
“Liu was lying for attention and views,
knowing that he had food at home and had received

42
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:58,010
living supplies from the community grid staff,
but he fabricated false facts such as ‘I

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,339
was hungry for almost ten days…’”

44
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:05,559
“Liu’s behavior has constituted slander
and disturbing the peace.

45
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:12,769
As a penalty, Liu has been detained for ten
days and fined 500 yuan”, which is around

46
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,670
$80 US dollars.

47
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,620
Hey, at least when you’re in jail, they
feed you.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,860
Maybe.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,540
But Mr. Liu’s post was not unique.

50
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,969
He’s one of literally thousands of people
who complained on social media that they were

51
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,319
running out of food and medicine.

52
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,269
One resident wrote: “The true situation
is: My children are there and are about to

53
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:39,359
run out of food.

54
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,449
Many food delivery apps won’t deliver for
2 or 3 days!

55
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,269
There’s panic because of the lack of supplies!

56
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,560
There’s a severe shortage of medical workers!

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,719
We can’t hold on much longer!

58
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,680
No one will pick up our calls!

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,790
Which department could we call for help?!

60
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,439
I ask the national government for emergency
assistance!”

61
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,780
And this person says...

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,689
“Everyone please pay attention to Tonghua
City’s lockdown!\h

63
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:06,689
1.

64
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,749
There are over 200 confirmed cases.\h

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,010
2.

66
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,499
Necessary goods are in extremely short supply.

67
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:14,639
3.

68
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,900
Medical workers are overloaded and short staffed.

69
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,040
4.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,000
The lockdown has caused many people to not
have enough food.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
5.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,980
There’s been no response to people’s problems.

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
6.

74
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,789
The country and society are not paying attention.”

75
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,990
And then there’s this hopeful post...

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,169
￼
“I hope this comments section doesn’t

77
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,270
get blocked, so that netizens can hear the
voices from Tonghua City, and check whether

78
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,150
these policies are being implemented.”

79
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,979
Well, the comments section did get blocked.

80
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:58,710
So you see, Mr. Liu’s so-called ‘fabricated
false facts’ may not be so fabricated.

81
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,699
Tonghua City is going through a sudden and
severe lockdown.

82
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,930
There’s just very little media coverage.

83
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:13,020
And we know how bad it is, because the mayor
of Tonghua actually made a public apology

84
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,139
for the abrupt lockdown and failure to give
citizens enough warning.

85
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,639
And it’s not often you see a Chinese government
official apologizing.

86
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,960
And even Chinese state-run media have started
publishing articles to cover their butts—like

87
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,629
this one about how the government is planning
to provide daily necessities to 110,000 families

88
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,260
“amid criticism of sluggish supplies delivery”.

89
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,610
But at least finally people there can get
some real...ugh, vegetables!?

90
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,289
Gimme a break.

91
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,729
And anyway, state-run media’s claims might
not even be true.

92
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,550
Shocker, I know.

93
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,740
Here’s a video of a resident on the 4th
floor of an apartment sharing supplies with

94
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,440
a resident two stories up.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,009
Which you probably wouldn’t need if the
government were actually delivering all the

96
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:07,699
food they promised.

97
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,710
\h
The local Public Security Bureau may not be

98
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,740
doing a good job providing food.

99
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,060
But they are at least good at punishing people
for spreading information.

100
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,370
To scare other people from complaining online,
they released a video of Mr. Liu’s apology,

101
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,460
where he ‘admitted’ to illegally spreading
rumors.

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
“After this whole situation.

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I recognize my errors.

104
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,900
I should not have spread false information
during the virus pandemic.

105
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,909
I also should not give the civil servants
an unnecessarily hard time.

106
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,909
I recognize this is my fault.

107
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,650
In the future, whether it’s in public or
on the internet, I will not impulsively say

108
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,660
whatever, and I will avoid any factually inaccurate
discourse.

109
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,979
This is certainly a problem that I have.

110
00:06:49,979 --> 00:07:00,409
I will be sure to change my— I will be sure
to pay attention to what I say.

111
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,409
Uhmm…

112
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:12,669
And that said, I also hope, uhmm, my comrades
will uhh, punish me lightly for seeking attention.

113
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,710
Thank you everybody.”

114
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,550
Well that’s a pretty vague apology.

115
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,620
Maybe because he doesn’t even know what
he’s apologizing for.

116
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,650
His social media post was merely a last resort
after being ignored by the authorities—despite

117
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,039
his post saying “I support the country,
I support the government.”

118
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,690
But in communist China, even if you support
the government—that doesn’t mean the government

119
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,120
will support you.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,389
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a viewer who supports China Uncensored

121
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,520
on Patreon.

122
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,900
Joshua Wyss asks:
“Chris, in your recent video about Xi JinPing's

123
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,729
daughter you said to stop giving the CCP money
through investments and buying Chinese products.

124
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,949
Do you think we should also avoid tourist
travel as well?”

125
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,520
Yes.

126
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,259
Stop traveling to mainland China.

127
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,520
I don’t know why anyone would travel there
now, given that they can arbitrarily detain

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,000
people.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,879
But even outside of that, if you visit China,
everything you buy, all the money you spend

130
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,129
on train tickets and tourist attractions—a
part of that is going to support the Chinese

131
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,180
Communist Party.

132
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,909
The Communist Party is committing genocide...and
genocide ain’t cheap.

133
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,860
If you like Chinese culture, may I suggest
you visit the vibrant, friendly, democratic

134
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,099
country of Taiwan.

135
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,810
Which is also full of delicious night markets.\h

136
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,440
You know, after we can all travel again.

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,570
Thanks for your question, Joshua.

138
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,530

Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
