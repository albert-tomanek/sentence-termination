00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,800
China’s garbage ban stinks!

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,420
And we’re back.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,929
The Chinese Communist Party has come up

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,730
with a brilliant solution to its pollution
problem—

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,130
blame it on the foreigners!

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,380
Pollution is one of the few problems

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,930
the Chinese regime can’t ignore.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,030
Because it’s really easy to see.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,030
T

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,440
hat is if you can see anything.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,750
So after decades of rapid industrialization

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,450
and economic growth at any cost,

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,730
the Chinese regime is doing what it does best—

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,460
cracking down on things.

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,780
In this case, pollution.

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,680
But the Party is also doing

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,850
the other thing it does best—

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,910
shifting the blame.

20
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,460
China is banning foreign garbage.

21
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,880
“Foreign garbage is loathed by everyone,”

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,890
as one Chinese environment minister put it.

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,650
In this notification to the World Trade Organization,

24
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,730
the Chinese regime announced it would ban

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,060
the import of 24 kinds of solid waste.

26
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,659
That includes things like paper,

27
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,450
as well as, “tires, textiles, plastic, and
glass,

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,760
and it will limit the importation of other
waste

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,170
such as steel, copper and aluminum scrap.”

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,590
China is also banning other types of waste,

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,770
like Jersey Shore DVDs.

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,979
The reason?

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,979
Protection of human health or safety;

34
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,500
Protection of animal or plant life or health;

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,380
and Protection of the environment.

36
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,190
Now you might be asking yourself,

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,450
China imports foreign garbage?

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,450
I mean,

39
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,889
I know the US imports a lot of Chinese garbage.

40
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,420
But who imports actual garbage?

41
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,869
Well, you may not know this,

42
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,619
but garbage is big business.

43
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,390
You may see a pile of trash,

44
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,509
but I see gold!

45
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,509
Gold!

46
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,969
You hear me?!

47
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:48,969
Recycling other people’s garbage

48
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,040
is a global industry worth billions.

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,740
And China is a huge part of it.

50
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,329
In 2016,

51
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,749
China imported 45 million tonnes of scrap
metal,

52
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,369
waste paper and plastic,

53
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,139
together worth over 18 billion dollars.

54
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,450
And it’s the United States

55
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,630
that’s sending China most of its garbage.

56
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,159
According to the Solid Waste Association of
North America—

57
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,870
yes that’s a thing—

58
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,230
“China is the largest export market

59
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,739
for recyclables generated in the United States.

60
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,530
They import about 13 million tons of paper

61
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,090
and nearly 800,000 tons of plastic

62
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,790
from the United States annually.”

63
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,590
And really it creates this circle of life
thing.

64
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,459
China makes a lot of cheap goods.

65
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,000
They’re packed into cardboard boxes,

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,680
and sent to the United States,

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,280
where they’re briefly,

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,750
and then thrown away.

69
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,110
And all that waste ultimately makes a trip

70
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,290
back to where it started—

71
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,830
China—to be recycled.

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,010
It’s beautiful.

73
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,170
But the benefits of recycling the world’s
garbage

74
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,069
went way beyond money.

75
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,989
30 years of China's manufacturing boom

76
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,130
was fueled by garbage,

77
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,989
garbage the Chinese regime encouraged the
world

78
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,829
to give to China.

79
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,180
Take copper for instance.

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,859
It’s essential to modern living.

81
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,090
You can’t transmit power or information
without it.

82
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,549
But why mine your own copper

83
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,470
when the rest of the world is throwing theirs
away?

84
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,469
According to the book, Junkyard Planet,

85
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:21,730
in 2012,

86
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,549
almost half of China’s copper

87
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,920
was made from recycled scrap.

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,939
And 70% of that scrap

89
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,230
came from the United States.

90
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,870
Same goes for plastic and paper.

91
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,519
It’s cheaper, quicker,

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,299
and easier to recycle plastic and paper

93
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,219
than it is to drill oil wells or cut down
trees.

94
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,930
And it’s a huge energy save on top of that.

95
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,060
According to Bloomberg,

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,790
“Recycling 1 ton of paper saves enough energy

97
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,819
to power the average American home

98
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,140
for six months,

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,769
while using recycled material to produce plastic

100
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,440
reduces the energy required

101
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,030
by as much as 87 percent.”

102
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,139
So since China has benefitted so much

103
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,560
from recycling the world’s garbage,

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,889
why the ban?

105
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,720
It’s a convenient scapegoat.

106
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Rather than dealing with

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,530
the root causes of pollution—

108
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,930
which are numerous and complex—

109
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,249
the Chinese regime can blame

110
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,909
the problem on foreigners,

111
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,970
and point to the ban as a tangible step

112
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,120
toward solving the problem.

113
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,400
The reality is,

114
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,280
most of China’s pollution problem

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
comes from internal factors.

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
While recycling foreign garbage

117
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,850
has created a booming industry,

118
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,790
it’s not always run in the safest

119
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,670
or most sanitary way,

120
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,330
China’s own recycling system is a mess.

121
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,460
According to the World Bank,

122
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,650
in eight years China will be throwing away

123
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,160
1.4 million tons of garbage a day.

124
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,870
Twice as much as the United States.

125
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,080
Half of that will be burned.

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,420
And according to an in-depth report by NPR,

127
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,900
“they’re burning garbage the cheapest
way possible,

128
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,060
filling China’s skies with an unknown amount

129
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,300
of cancer-causing heavy metal and dioxin emissions.”

130
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,900
Rather than solving the environmental problems,

131
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,370
“this crackdown will actually worsen them
—

132
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,570
and do so at the expense of jobs

133
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,080
and economic growth around the world.”

134
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,280
According to this study,

135
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,340
40,000 American jobs relied on

136
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,530
the garbage and recycling industry.

137
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,530
And in China,

138
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,120
that number is multiples larger.

139
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,200
The Chinese ban on foreign garbage,

140
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
while giving the Communist Party

141
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
something to boast about,

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,830
actually hurts Chinese people,

143
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,360
and doesn’t really do much

144
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,490
to protect the environment.

145
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,710
In the meantime,

146
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,360
what happens to all that garbage?

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,020
Well, right now,

148
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,190
it’s piling up in Hong Kong.

149
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,710
Eventually, other southeast Asian countries

150
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,190
will be able to take some of it

151
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,460
to give their economies

152
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,550
the boost it did for China.

153
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,680
But most of the garbage

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
will end up in landfills.

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,530
Or the ocean.

156
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,050
So what do you think of China’s garbage
ban?

157
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,140
