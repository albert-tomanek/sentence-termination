00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello Jordan, thank you for joining me today.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,500
Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,920
This is Jordan Horowitz, the co-director and
producer of Angel of Nanjing.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,349
It's a film about a guy who's dedicated the
past 10 years of his life

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,630
to preventing people from killing themselves
on the Yangtze river bridge in Nanjing.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,110
We have a clip of that movie, so let's check
that out.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,700
How come you're in such a bad mood, Big Sis?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I know your burden is too heavy,

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,360
and your mind is overwhelmed.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,820
What difficulty can it be? Sufferings are
normal.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,640
I really can't stand it anymore.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,400
You think you can escape suffering by avoiding
the problem?

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,480
I think it's useless to wait for my husband
to change his mind.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,920
Can I help you? What's the use having a brain
if you don't come up with ideas?

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,520
He met a foreign lady in Macao. That lady
is 4 years younger than I am.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,680
He's got skills.

17
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,049
How can he be true to me when he's having
an affair?

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,620
How do you think he would treat your daughter
after you die?

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Today you met me, your Big Brother.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Let me give you an idea or two.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,140
If I can't resolve your issues, then you can
proceed with death, ok?

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,560
Ok, come with me.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,480
What's wrong?

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,100
So, Chen really sounds more like a football
coach than anything else.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,320
Yeah, I can see that.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,310
He's got a big personality and he's very in
your face at times.

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,920
And that works?

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,990
It works for him, yeah.

29
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,499
You know, psychologists might tell you

30
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,579
that's not the proper method when dealing
with things like that,

31
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,619
but they're saying that from an office.

32
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,329
Yeah, they're not on the bridge talking people
down.

33
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:58,729
Exactly!

34
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,649
What he does, in my experience,

35
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,310
following for a year he's very effective and
he's kind of no nonsense,

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,099
he's kind of funny at times.

37
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,569
His methods are extremely effective.

38
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,849
About how many people has he been able to
talk down?

39
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,549
According to his records, he's saved over
300 people.

40
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:19,099
Wow!

41
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,970
And that was at the time of us making the
movie,

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,269
so I'd imagine that number's much higher now.

43
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,229
Yeah, and so why did you want to make this
movie?

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,580
I read about him online in a small article
a really good friend of mine had sent to me,

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,819
and I was just really inspired by what he
was doing,

46
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,279
I thought it was amazing.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,780
As soon as I read it, I knew it was something
that I just had to jump on.

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,980
But I notice in the film, you don’t show
any of the stuff you're supposed to show

49
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,970
when you're shooting a movie in China;

50
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,830
there's no glistening skyscraper or high speed
rail.

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,909
China actually comes across as kind of a pretty
poor place.

52
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,730
I'm wondering was this the China you expected

53
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,030
or was it different from what you imagined.

54
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,950
I don’t really know what I expected going
there.

55
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,989
I do feel strongly that this was the China
that I encountered.

56
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,659
This was the daily life for me being there

57
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,599
and this is Chen's daily life, and Chen does
not live in an affluent area.

58
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,959
He's a very average, common man.

59
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,299
Which is what makes what he's doing-

60
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,049
it's what makes him so effective at what he's
doing

61
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,220
because most of the people going to the bridge
to kill themselves

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,459
are very poor people and that’s how he's
so relatable to them.

63
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,629
So one thing that I just want those of you
watching to understand

64
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,620
is that this bridge is very high,

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,740
so if you jump, there's no surviving that.

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,131
Yeah.

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,469
When you were with Chen, were there people
he couldn’t save?

68
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,659
There were definitely times where we would
arrive on the weekend

69
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,780
and Chen would point out, like a bloodstain
or something on the cement

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,600
and he's like somebody jumped last night
or something like that.

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,900
And how did that affect him?

72
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,599
It definitely affects him.

73
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,459
We talk about that at great length in the
film.

74
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,430
He says he's profoundly affected by what he's
done.

75
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,469
He does not think of himself as a hero. He
really struggles with-

76
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,019
He's saved over 300 people and he doesn’t
think of himself as a hero?

77
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,709
Yeah he really feels like a failure for the
people he hasn’t saved.

78
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,070
It really haunts him.

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,810
He drinks a lot, he smokes a lot, as you see
in the film, and those are the reasons.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,310
A lot of drinking.

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
Yeah.

82
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,820
And I understand you had to join him?

83
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,450
Yeah Chen, you know Chen likes to drink.

84
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,530
He insists that we drink with him when we're
there

85
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,690
so there's some shaky footage in the film
and I think a big part of that-

86
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,290
part of that is because we're so far away
filming on very telephoto lenses

87
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,810
and another part is that we're probably drunk.

88
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,310
Well so that’s something I was wondering.

89
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,660
The first thing i was thinking when I saw
this film is,

90
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,390
how did two foreigners film this entire documentary
in China

91
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,090
and not get stopped by authorities?

92
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,450
We were definitely concerned about that when
we first went out there.

93
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,560
My partner and I would keep duplicate sets
of hard drives in separate places

94
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,220
just incase something happened.

95
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,310
Luckily nothing ever happened

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,650
but there was one instance with a translator
who for some reason

97
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,910
he thought the guards who patrolled the bridge
were trying to arrest us

98
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,120
and apparently he ran off the bridge and threw
his cellphone in the water

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,450
and it was a big deal,

100
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,150
fortunately the whole thing got calmed down.

101
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,950
But needless to say, he didn’t work out.

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,560
No, well I mean especially cause you don't
have a cellphone

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,540
to contact him with anymore.

104
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,630
That's probably the main thing.

105
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,140
He did send us some threatening emails for
a while but it all worked out.

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,510
Threatening you about what?

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,090
He got it in his head that the best thing
for us to do is alert the government

108
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,780
on what we're doing and Chen is the one who's
like, that’s a huge mistake.

109
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,250
He's like- "I've already got enough bad attention
on me,"

110
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,560
he's like, "you just need to just keep your
mouth shut."

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,140
There's bad attention on Chen?

112
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,040
I mean he's saving people from committing suicide.

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,180
So it's gotten better, it used to be-

114
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,090
Chen told me when he first started what he
was doing,

115
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,920
he would get threats from police saying "you're
bringing—"

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,610
because Chen gets a lot of attention from
the press,

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,570
they're like, "you're bringing bad attention
to China.

118
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,240
We're losing face. If you keep doing this,
you're going to get hurt."

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,350
So its more important that China looks good,
rather than actually saving people?

120
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,030
It's debatable.

121
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,280
He has gotten some humanitarian awards and
I do think times have changed.

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,180
They now realize that he's looked at in such
a positive way

123
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,750
that he's actually bringing good attention
to the area.

124
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,020
So they've stopped threatening him?

125
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah, as far as I know.

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,820
Wow. Well so, what- they threaten him- what
could the government be doing?

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,120
It seems to me that if you just built higher
fences, it would solve a lot of-

128
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,280
It's a very valid point.

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,500
For example, here in New York, the Williamsburg
Bridge has a fence

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,560
that is pretty high and it'd be really hard
to climb over it.

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,510
China doesn’t do that,

132
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,010
if you jump off of that bridge you land in
the water and you don’t disrupt anything.

133
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,190
And from what I've heard, they said it costs
too much money.

134
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,050
But as I understand it, on that bridge

135
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,950
there are high fences around the area where
somebody could jump

136
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,110
and land on the train tracks below.

137
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,530
That's right.

138
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,840
There's one small section of the fence where
it's overhanging a train track,

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,510
and if you were to jump, you would land in
the train tracks,

140
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,350
so they put a fence there and nobody jumps
there.

141
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,350
Cause you might delay traffic.

142
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,830
It's really sad.

143
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,690
I mean it's a very easily, fixable scenario

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
and it really sucks that they don’t do anything
about it.

145
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,620
So rather than building high fences,

146
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,620
they threaten the one guy who's trying to
actually help people.

147
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,210
Yeah, at first.

148
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,000
So what motivates him to potentially go up
against the government,

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,930
to spend over a decade of his life and his
own money to do this?

150
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,620
He learned form the media from the early new
reports that most of the people-

151
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,150
over 60% of the people that go to the bridge
to commit suicide

152
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,630
are outsiders to the city,

153
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,890
and Chen himself is an outsider so he knows
what that feeling is like

154
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,930
of having nowhere to go, no one to talk to,
and just really struggling.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,420
Well, he sounds like an incredible individual.

156
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,270
Yeah, he's a great guy, and he's got a great
sense of humor,

157
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,450
that’s my favorite part about him.

158
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,450
Even in that clip you saw some of that come
out.

159
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,190
Yeah.

160
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,520
When he compliments the woman's husband who's
cheating on her.

161
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,250
Right right.

162
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,740
You know what's so great about Chen is that
he's just an ordinary guy

163
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,000
doing something really extraordinary with
his life

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,510
and it really made me think about how we all
