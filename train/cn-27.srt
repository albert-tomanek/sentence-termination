00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,220
And the bounciest man on the internet, 
Matt Gray!

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,370
Putting the butt into butter.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,140
That's a big tub. No offence.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,950
That's why he got sacked from the catering
industry!

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,600
It's true.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,590
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't see it...

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,560
"It's everywhere! I can't even see it to get
it off!"

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,380
Every fact they...

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,220
"I just keep wiping and it stays!"

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,160
"Water's just running off!

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
"I've made myself accidentally arse-waterproof!"

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,399
Which is great when I'm on a National Express
coach, let's face it.

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,399
Matt Gray's Gore-Tex Arse!

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Salted or unsalted? I care not to taste.

15
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,139
In front of me, I've got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't...

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,890
Stork Arse Margarine!

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,199
"I don't know what happened! I gave his arse
a little pat and that's just..."

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,580
-- That was good. That was good.
I like that one.
-- Thank you!

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,289
Four men laughing in a kitchen.
