1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,130
The US and China are in a trade war.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,870
And wars need weapons.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,950
And what better weapon to strike hard at the
US imperialists...

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,280
than with your own currency!

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,680
Surely, nothing could go wrong!

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,199
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,750
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,400
Just when you thought the US-China trade war

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,480
was chugging along just fine already,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,869
President Trump decided to up the ante.

11
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,840
The Trump administration has announced the
US

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,220
will put tariffs on nearly

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,370
$300 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports—

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,499
pretty much everything that doesn’t have
a tariff already.

15
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:37,539
Some of those tariffs are slated

16
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,170
to go into effect on September 1st, others—

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,300
as announced yesterday—

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,920
would go into effect on December 15th.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,449
So in the face of this American superpower...

20
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:50,639
what can the poor, oppressed Chinese leaders
do?

21
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,699
One answer could be... weaponize their currency!

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,929
Thanks to the enormous power of the Chinese
Communist Party

23
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,340
over the government, the banks, and state-run
industries,

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,769
it has a lot of control over the currency
and how goods are priced.

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,340
The Chinese central bank has recently allowed
the Chinese currency—

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,820
the yuan—to get weaker against the US dollar.

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,380
That means Chinese exports to the US are cheaper.

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,880
And that counteracts some of Trump’s tariffs

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,799
that make those same exports more expensive.

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,130
It balances out.

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,130
So in a way,

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,130
that’s like using the currency as a defensive
weapon.

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,829
And a weaker yuan also hurts American companies

34
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,119
doing business inside China.

35
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,729
Those Chevys sold in Shanghai just got more
expensive.

36
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,369
Why not buy a Chinese car instead?

37
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,340
So that’s China using currency as an offensive
weapon,

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,520
to hurt US companies.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,350
And it’s not just currency that can be a
weapon.

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,590
In response to the latest tariffs,

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,729
the Chinese regime has already ordered state-run
companies

42
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,609
to stop buying American crops, like soybeans.

43
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,359
That’s a weapon designed to hurt US farmers—

44
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,240
and with that, hurt Donald Trump’s voter
base.

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,189
And if going after US farmers isn’t enough,

46
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,539
China’s producers of rare earth metals say

47
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,560
they’re ready to weaponize their supply
stranglehold.

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,989
It’s a stranglehold because China controls

49
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,520
about 80% of the world’s rare earth metals.

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,900
That includes elements like yttrium and neodymium

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,200
that are essential for iPhones and other electronics.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,020
Of course, if iPhones become too expensive,

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,459
you’ll have no choice but to buy alternatives,

54
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,410
like the Huawei P20 Pro!

55
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,269
It has all the features you crave in a knockoff
iPhone,

56
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,110
with none of the security protections!

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,060
Of course, there’s a potential problem

58
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,310
with the Chinese Communist Party

59
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,269
weaponizing the Chinese currency and other
parts of the economy:

60
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,269
The bigger the weapon, the bigger the recoil.

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,450
If the Communist Party restricts exports

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,260
of rare earth metals to the US,

63
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,299
US companies may simply increase their own
production—

64
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,290
because local mining becomes more profitable
when import prices go up.

65
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,049
In fact, that happened with Japan.

66
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,049
“China banned [rare earth] exports to Japan

67
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,659
after a 2010 territorial dispute,

68
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,409
which resulted in... a push by Japanese industry

69
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,939
to develop substitutes and alternatives,

70
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,849
ultimately hurting Chinese producers.”

71
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:18,250
And then last year,

72
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,470
Japan had a huge windfall,

73
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,610
discovering enough rare earth minerals to
last 780 years.

74
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,610
Which is enough to allow my replacement,

75
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,500
the Sarcastibot 3000,

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,410
to continually poke fun at presitator Xi Jinping
for centuries.

77
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,060
“He still wants that sweet, sweet honey.

78
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,190
Haha.

79
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,319
Haha.

80
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,329
Anyway, there are more ways these economic
weapons

81
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,810
could backfire for China.

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,019
For example, the Communist Party’s tactic

83
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,060
of going after American farmers to hurt Trump....

84
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,590
is not working very well.

85
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,599
It’s true, a lot of American farmers are
hurting,

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,879
as China has stopped buying their products.

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,500
And I get it, the Communist Party naturally
assume

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,560
the peasants will rise up against their oppressor.

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,019
The problem is, a lot of American farmers

90
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,950
don’t see Trump as the oppressor.

91
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,819
They’re sticking with him.

92
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,290
A lot of them see Trump as helping farmers

93
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,319
stand up to the real oppressor:

94
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,040
The Chinese Communist Party—

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
which is, after all,

96
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,950
the one actually *trying* to hurt American
farmers.

97
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,190
This CNBC article cites a farmer from Illinois
as saying,

98
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,710
“most farmers are more concerned about getting
the situation solved

99
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,120
than pointing fingers.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,880
But if they were to place blame,

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,900
most of it would be on China,

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,500
and the rest would be on previous presidents

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,970
who could have solved the trade imbalances
more easily

104
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,820
15 or 20 years ago.”

105
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,600
And it also helps that Trump is using some
of the money

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,650
the US is getting from Chinese tariffs to
subsidize US farmers.

107
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,470
And as for the Chinese central bank allowing
the Chinese yuan

108
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,480
to get weaker against the dollar...yes,

109
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,650
it helps Chinese exports,

110
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,460
but it also hurts Chinese companies—

111
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,420
companies that have borrowed US money.

112
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,500
See, “Dollar-denominated debt held by Chinese
firms

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,070
is now more than 1.5 trillion dollars.”

114
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,110
That means that Chinese companies have *borrowed*

115
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,110
more than 1.5 trillion US dollars...

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,640
that have to be paid back in US dollars.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Why?

118
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,050
Because the US Federal Reserve

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,870
has kept interest rates at historic lows

120
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,820
since the 2008 financial crisis.

121
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,670
And Chinese companies that needed to borrow
money

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,540
to make big investments—like real estate
developers—

123
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,530
realized it would be cheaper to borrow *US
dollars*

124
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,840
than to borrow Chinese yuan to pay for all
that construction...

125
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,030
and those fancy real estate displays.

126
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,030
At the same time,

127
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,620
the Chinese financial sector

128
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,520
also took advantage of low US interest rates,

129
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,840
and borrowed cheap US dollars to invest in
other things,

130
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,810
hoping to get a bigger return on investment.

131
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,190
As you can see in this chart from Axios,

132
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,500
Chinese borrowing has skyrocketed over the
past decade.

133
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,520
But now that China’s currency is weaker,

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,320
it’s more expensive to pay back all that
debt.

135
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,710
Let’s say, for example, you’re a Chinese
real estate developer

136
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,240
and you borrowed money for construction.

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,820
You paid in yuan to borrow a billion US dollars.

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,840
But because the yuan is roughly 2% weaker
now,

139
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,140
it’s 2% more expensive to pay it back.

140
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,980
And that extra amount you owe is the equivalent
of $20 million dollars.

141
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,640
So for the Chinese economy overall

142
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,310
that borrowed 1.5 trillion dollars—

143
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,970
they now owe a collective 30 billion dollars

144
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,140
more than they did just two weeks ago.

145
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,520
30 billion dollars is a is a lot of money.

146
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,220
It makes my student loan lender seem like
an angel.

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,220
An angel that’ll break my kneecaps if I
don’t repay, but still.

148
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,960
And if the yuan keeps falling,

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
the higher cost of repaying US dollars

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,430
could get really bad for Chinese companies.

151
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,260
Now as I said, a weaker yuan

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,310
does help boost Chinese exports to the US—

153
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,620
but that’s a long-term prospect,

154
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,790
and exports probably won’t go up enough
to compensate.

155
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,480
Especially because no one wants to buy their
stupid love pandas!

156
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
So why does all this matter?

157
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,010
Because this debt problem could have

158
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,520
a domino effect on the Chinese economy—

159
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,470
like layoffs that lead to mass unemployment,

160
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,100
or a nationwide economic downturn if credit
dries up.

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Which is to say,

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,620
the Chinese Communist Party’s methods

163
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,100
at fighting back against the US tariffs

164
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,860
could end up more like this.

165
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
So what do you think?

166
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
Leave your comments below.

167
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,650
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you,

168
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,440
a fan who supports China Uncensored

169
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,740
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

170
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,870
Tuhao Nanook asks:

171
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,870
“Chris...

172
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,830
Are there any US industries benefiting from
the tariffs?

173
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,390
Daddy needs a new Rolex.”

174
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,810
Good question, “Tuhao”.

175
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,740
Rolex, of course, is a Swiss company.

176
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,830
But now there’s a 10% tariff

177
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,480
on those knockoffs you buy in Chinatown.

178
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
But seriously,

179
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,430
a lot of US companies are benefiting from
the trade tariffs.

180
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,030
The kinds of US companies that benefit

181
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,540
most are the ones that were being hurt by
China

182
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,360
dumping products at unfairly low prices on
the US market.

183
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,540
For example, steel makers and the lumber industry.

184
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,580
Chinese steel and lumber are now more expensive
to import,

185
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,450
so those American companies can compete again.

186
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,630
For American companies that make

187
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,260
complicated things like electronics,

188
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,950
it’s harder to say.

189
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,150
Even if they manufacture in the US,

190
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,260
they may rely on components made in China

191
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,360
that are now more expensive.

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,990
So it’s a mixed bag.

193
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,580
But there are definitely some US manufacturers

194
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,750
who are able to get back in the game

195
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,110
and hire more American workers.

196
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,090
As for those US companies that went to China

197
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,979
hoping to make a profit...

198
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,060
some of them have lost that bet.

199
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,419
And I don’t feel too bad for them.

200
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,990
Thanks for your question.

201
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,729
And thank all of you for watching.

202
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,930
A lot of companies don’t want to advertise
with a show like this,

203
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,259
that criticizes the Chinese Communist Party.

204
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,879
So we rely on your support to keep this show
going.

This week, Matt, Shelley, and I did a podcast

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,959
with China expert and economist Christopher
Balding.

215
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,570
He goes into a ton of fascinating detail about
the trade war,

216
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,990
and the Trump administration’s larger strategy.
