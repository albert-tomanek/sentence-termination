1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,450
E-voting is a terrible idea

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,370
After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, election officials
in some parts of America decided that they'd

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,550
allow emergency e-voting from home. You'd
download a ballot paper, you'd fill it out,

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,429
and then you would email or fax it back to
them. And yes, some people still fax.

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:21,350
This was a terrible idea, and here's why.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,279
Physical voting is centuries old. In that
time, pretty much every conceivable method

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,910
of fraud has been tried, and has since been
defended against. Because of that, attacks

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,320
on physical voting don't scale well. It takes
so much effort, so many people and it only

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,940
takes one person to leak your conspiracy and
the whole thing falls apart.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,960
Electronic voting, though? You can attack
with one person. It can take about the same

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,879
effort to change one vote as it does to change
a million. And it can be done without even

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,610
setting foot in the country whose elections
you're trying to rig.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,430
There are two key parts of an election. Anonymity,
and trust. First of all, anonymity. You cannot

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,870
let anyone pay, bribe, or threaten in order
to change someone's vote. If you put any identifying

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,640
mark on your paper ballot, if you sign it,
if you write your name on it, if you do anything

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,220
that could, in theory, be used to check how
you voted, your vote is thrown out and ignored,

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,750
just so no-one can be forced or bribed to
vote a certain way.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,600
And yet, because you marked your vote, and
you put it into a sealed box, and that box

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,710
was only unsealed when it was surrounded by
everyone with a stake in the election, you

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,470
know that your vote has still been counted,
even though you'll never see it again.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,650
That's the other key: trust. You never, ever,
ever, trust any one individual. Ideally, you

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,770
don't trust any two, or three. People can
be bribed, can be threatened, can be incompetent.

23
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,979
I mean, hell, people have been all three of
those things. But like I said: the more physical

24
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,790
votes you want to change, the more people
it takes and the less possible your attack

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,610
gets. Everyone can see what's happening and
keep an eye on each other, particularly if

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,020
they don't trust the other side.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,110
So let's talk about voting machines.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,750
Problem 1: Auditing the software and hardware

29
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,649
In theory, you could have open source software
that everyone has checked and everyone is

30
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,940
happy with and that's been used for years.
In theory. Never mind that you only actually

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,810
do a full-scale test of this software every
few years when there's actually an election,

32
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,640
let's say theoretically it can be done.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,099
But how do you make sure that software is
what's actually loaded on that voting machine

34
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,620
in front of you on the day of the election?

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,300
And I know that immediately, someone is going
to want to comment about checksums or crypto.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,750
Which is great, except now you have to trust
the software that's checking that hash. Or

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,780
more likely, the one person that's checking
it for you. You've just moved the problem.

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,810
And if you're thinking "I could verify that",
then turn your brain the other way, and think

39
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,099
"how could I break that?" because there are
trillions of dollars -- that's not an exaggeration

40
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,110
-- riding on the result of big elections,
and that's an incredible motivation. If you're

41
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,470
coming up with sneaky ways to get around it...
believe me, so are lots of other people.

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,640
It might be one angry techie, but it might
be an entire political party, or the huge

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,930
corporations who want one party to win, or
entire nation states who want one party to

44
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,230
win.

45
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,590
And all that is assuming you're even allowed
to verify the software that's running, which

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,280
you never are, because plugging unknown USB
sticks into a voting machine is a bad idea.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,989
Not that that stops people plugging unknown
USB sticks into a voting machine. It has literally

48
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,450
happened. Let's remember, these machines have
to be left in a room with the voter and no-one

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,250
else in order for them to cast their vote
anonymously. Oh, by the way, the machines

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,560
are frequently programmed by sticking a USB
into each of them in turn, so if you compromise

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,519
the first one, jackpot.

52
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,780
In practice, you don't have open source software,
you have proprietary, unaudited software which

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,549
you just have to trust. This is real, by the
way, around the world, there are some elections

54
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:46,400
that run on this. And remember what I said?
This is an election. You don't trust.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,709
And maybe you're thinking, you could have
an audit trail, you could have a paper backup

56
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,269
that the machine prints out as you vote. In
which case, congratulations, you've just invented

57
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,360
the world's most expensive pencil. One of
the reasons Britain gives people pencils for

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,390
voting, by the way, is because we're worried
that pens might be switched by any voter to

59
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:11,390
contain disappearing ink. Erasing pencil ballots?
Takes time, and if you can do that, you can

60
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,849
just throw them away. Disappearing ink? It
might be an urban legend, but it might actually

61
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,570
be a plausible attack vector. This is the
level of paranoia we need to work at here.

62
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,130
And don't think you can get away with all
this by using a pile of paper ballots and

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,560
just counting them electronically, either:
an electronic counting machine is still a

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,770
black box that a pile of ballots goes into
and a mysterious number comes out of. They've

65
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,680
got exactly the same problems.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,290
Problem 2: Votes In Transit

67
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,220
There are three ways of moving the magic electronic
ballot numbers from the voting machines to

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,490
the final count.

69
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,560
You could treat the machine like a regular
ballot box, you seal it in a plastic bag,

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,830
move the physical machine with two people
in the vehicle to the count, and then unseal

71
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,800
it there. No-one does this.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,850
You could copy the result onto a handy USB
stick and move that instead. Do I need to

73
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,310
run through how easily... no. Okay.

74
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,139
Or, and this is what usually happens, you
could tell the voting machine to upload the

75
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,620
results over the internet, optionally through
a third central server, and potentially not

76
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,620
over a secure connection, and probably without
any checksums or tests. [exasperating]

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,110
Problem 3: Central Count Program

78
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,840
And right at the end, there's the program
that takes all these numbers, all these votes,

79
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,710
and produces a final count. Now you've got
all the same problems you have with the individual

80
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,530
voting machines, except now only a few people
can even see that machine, and it's been hidden

81
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,520
away in a private warehouse somewhere for
the last few years. Good luck verifying that.

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,370
And all this -- all this -- is before we even
talk about online voting.

83
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,610
I could talk about all the ways which you
could hijack ballots, block an email address

84
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,180
-- because after Hurricane Sandy, the ballots
were sent by email -- or any of the ways you

85
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,340
could do a man-in-the-middle attack on that.
All possible.

86
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,460
And those are just if it's a well designed
system.

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,620
There are reports of actual live elections
where there were cross-site scripting attacks

88
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,740
in the e-voting page, where they'd misspelled
one party's name, and where they'd put the

89
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,330
wrong party's logo next to a candidate. Sorry,
did I say elections? I meant election. That

90
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,430
was all the same election, it was in Hampshire
in 2007.

91
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,289
But never mind all that.

92
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:25,289
Depending on which security company you believe,
somewhere around 5% and 50% of desktop computers

93
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,300
are infected with something. And that's just
the scammers trying to set up botnets and

94
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,080
minor extortions using private computers.
If you want to affect a load of votes, try

95
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,600
infecting the computers at the public library.
But never mind all that.

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,150
We've seen what big scary countries and big
scary corporations can do when they put their

97
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,590
mind to it. Given that someone designed an
immensely complicated worm that spread around

98
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,039
the world just to break some Iranian centrifuges,
imagine what someone could do if they wanted

99
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,800
to throw an online election.

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,740
Remember, again, when you hear "just trust
us", or "just trust me", or "it's a computer,

101
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,690
it doesn't go wrong" in an election, something
has already gone disastrously wrong.

102
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,880
Imagine all this electronic voting, only without
computers. Would you be happy walking up to

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,750
someone anonymous in a ballot box, or worse,
calling a number on your phone, just telling

104
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,360
them your vote -- but they promise to keep
it secret -- and at the end of the election

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,000
all those people, who have been sitting on
their own, phone up one other person in private

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,169
and tell their results, and then that final
person -- who promises to count it all up

107
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,620
accurately -- announces who's won? Because
that's essentially what electronic voting

108
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:34,090
is. It is a terrible idea, and if a government
ever promises to use it, hope they don't manage

109
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,000
it before you get a chance to vote 

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,400
them out.
