1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,240
There are several hard problems when designing software.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,100
I'm not talking about computer science hard problems like NP-complete things.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,460
I mean hard problems of design, and internationalisation is one of the worst.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,420
Let's imagine you started a social network. Let's imagine that you made it for English-speaking users.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,700
First problem is when someone called Chloë joins,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,660
'cause Chloë has an umlaut above her 'e' and is angry that she can't put her name in properly.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,960
So, okay, you say "I'll open up and add a few more accent characters."

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,180
Well, then someone Icelandic calls in, and he's got an eth in his name. Looks like that.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,380
Looks like that. Sounds like 'th.'

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,500
"Fine," you say. "So let's use all of Unicode."

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,440
And then someone probably breaks your site because there's control characters in Unicode that break everything.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,280
OK, fine, so you work out which characters are allowed to be used in names and you just stick to those.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,760
I mean, that's like 30,000 characters when you include all of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text,

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
but never mind! You put it in.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,420
And then you start getting some users in other countries.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,800
First problem you get is France.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
Your French translator calls and says,

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,780
"Look, you've got a "Like" button here, and what I want to put in is "J'aime" -- "I like" --

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,320
but it's not quite big enough? I need you to make the button bigger?"

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,520
And there's problems like this all over the place where sentences that take five syllables in English

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,500
actually take a whole two-paragraph description in some other language.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,080
So you tweak the design. You make it so that the lengths of texts can change.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,060
And then you start working out that what you really want to do is have some kind of drop-in system.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,040
So, in English, you can just put in "%NAME likes this."

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,400
And then you can send that over to the translators and --

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,360
see, this is where I should really speak more than one language --

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,060
but they can send back -- um, I'm gonna make up a language here --

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,920
ah, they can say something like "Mana %NAME adilo,"

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,340
which, in their language, means "so-and-so likes this."

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,100
Great! That system's gonna work! You can just send a load of text blocks to them and they can send it b--

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,680
"Hello? Ah, Italy. Yes. What's with -- right, you need to know the gender of everyone using this network.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Why do you need to know that?"

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,940
Italian language relies on gender.

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,800
The words in the sentence change depending on whether you're talking about a man or a woman.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,940
Well, that's, that's irritating 'cause you haven't asked users for gender.

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,820
Facebook have this exact problem.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,060
But, OK, you start asking and the translators start sending back strings,

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,260
and now, of course, anyone who doesn't fit immediately into male or female,

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,180
and, if that surprises you, you need to get out more,

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,000
but anyone who doesn't fit into those categories, well, now they're angry that they have to go into one or the other.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,560
You have to ask them, "Well, languages don't support that. Which one are we going with?"

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,460
And, in fact, there's a lot of translators calling back and saying they can't support that.

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,740
OK. You move past that. You dam down the storm and it moves on,

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,360
and then you get a call from France again.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,980
They say, "By the way, you've got a singular and a plural here, but you can't use the plural for 0.

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,180
We don't say that something has 'no likes, we say that it has 'no like,'

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,440
and 'one like,' and then 'two likes.'"

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,820
So, okay, I can put a special case in for that. And a few others call in and say,

49
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,080
"Um, yeah, we don't just have singular and plural. We have singular and dual and plural.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,340
Our words change depending on whether there's one of something, two of something, or many of something."

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,620
OK. Great. Right. Special case in for that.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,100
And then, then, your Polish translator calls and they say,

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,720
"Right. We've got a paucal."

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Paucal is where you have a singular and then you have a different plural

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,120
depending on whether the number of things ends with 2, 3, and 4, or some other digit!

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,740
OK. Great. Fine. Put a special case in for that.

57
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,640
And then your Romanian translator calls

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,100
"Yeah, we need a different plural for any group of objects greater than 20."

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,300
OK. And then you finally get every different plural rule for every language in there,

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,100
and now the translators are vaguely happy.

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,660
Then your Icelandic translator calls, and they say,

62
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,080
"Right. You've got this '%NAME' thing that I'm just meant to replace."

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,340
Icelandic changes how the names appear depending on what else is in the sentence.

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,100
You might have "Tom." Then it might become "Toma" or "Tomi,"

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,520
and there are whole names that this doesn't work with because they don't fit the Icelandic pattern.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,660
You put all that in somehow, and then, then your German translator calls and is like,

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,400
"Look, you've got this uppercase and lowercase in.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,560
You wanna put stuff in big, bold uppercase letters sometimes, and I get that,

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,240
but we have this double 's' character. When you turn it to uppercase, it becomes two S's,

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,340
except sometimes when it doesn't, like in geographic names. Can you deal with that?"

71
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,200
OK. Right. Yes. I'll make sure we deal with that,

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,760
but that's not even the start of it, because then your Arabic translator calls, and they say,

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,280
"Right. You're doing this thing where you take an excerpt from a post.

74
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,860
You're taking the first 50 characters and then you're just putting a '...' on the end,

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,020
and that works for some languages, but not in Arabic. You can't just chop a word in half,

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,760
because the letters in one bit of the word change depending on the letters elsewhere.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,660
They all merge together into one nice, flowing thing,

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,260
and computers can deal with that, but you can't just crop it halfway through!"

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,420
OK. Fine. Go with that. Then the Arabic translator goes on to say,

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,940
"By the way, you're dealing with right-to-left text, right?"

81
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,900
Of course you're not. You haven't thought of that because, because surely all languages go left-to-right.

82
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,120
No, Arabic, Hebrew, they go right-to-left.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,100
And you say, "OK. I can kind of flip the whole design around so it still works that way?"

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,520
And they say, "Yeah, that would work, but then you're gonna have left-to-right names in the middle of right-to-left text,

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
because you're gonna talk about someone who has a name in a different character set.

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,140
Just make sure it can deal with that."

87
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,440
Oh... Then, if you're British, your American translator calls, or vice versa, and they say,

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,540
"You need to make sure the date format is right."

89
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,220
Because Americans, for some bizarre reason, do month-day-year. Brits, day-month-year.

90
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,300
And, by the way, in America, the week starts on a Sunday, and in Britain, the week starts on a Monday,

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,880
so you've gotta change all your calendars around,

92
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,680
and, by the way, Europe wants 24-hour clocks and America wants 12-hour clocks, and -- numbers!

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,700
Oh, God, we haven't started on numbers yet!

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,980
Because Europe wants "256.341,2." The comma and the full stop, or the period.

95
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
If you're American, they're around the other way!

96
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,840
Yeah, OK, you can deal with that and then, then the icing on the cake is your Indian translator calls

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
and says they have the Indian numbering system.

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't say "100,000." They have the crore and the lakh, so they would group it like that.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,540
And it all becomes incredibly, overly complicated and the last time I did a rant like this,

100
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,760
I said that what you do is you get someone else's timezone code and you treat it as a black box.

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,140
That, that doesn't work here because languages are infinitely more complex and subtle,

102
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,020
and there are so many changes that will be unique to whatever it is you're designing.

103
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,220
The black box that Facebook uses for translation won't work for whatever you're doing.

104
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,060
It won't work if you're designing software for Windows or Mac or Linux or iPhone.

105
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,300
You can use certain references, certain functions, certain little things to make it easier,

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,820
but ultimately you are going to have to go out and translate it and deal with all of this wonderful mess,

107
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,840
or you do what programmers have done for many years, and say,

108
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,740
"Yeah. We're just producing it in English."

109
