1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
This is the Technical Difficulties

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,070
and we are playing
Two Of These People Are Lying

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,690
because two of these people will be.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,460
Chris Joel.

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,900
Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:09,408
I'm fully toilet trained!

7
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:10,520
And Matt Gr...

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,652
okay. That got me.
That got me, well done.

9
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:15,485
And Matt Gray.

10
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,870
The way this works,
if you haven't noticed yet,

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,550
is the three of us will
pick a Widip-- Wikipedia article

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,000
--widi-widi-widi
wiki-wiki-Wikipedia article--

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
And put it down on one
of these pieces of card.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,750
Tom is now going to select
one of these pieces of card.

15
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,650
Oh my goodness.

16
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,460
One of us will be telling
the truth about what this is

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,020
the other two have no idea,
and we'll be making it up.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,110
We'll be lying.

19
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,373
And today we are talking about Henricus.

20
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,143
Henricus.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,760
Chris, could you please
tell me about Henricus.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,960
Noted, ancient Roman--
not ancient Roman.

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,490
It's not really ancient.
It is ancient Rome?

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,160
Yeah, ancient Rome,
actually that rings true.

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,840
I mean if he was modern
Rome that would be--

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,673
Yeah.

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,560
Noted Caeser-era Rome, there we go,
qualifier...

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,500
drunkard.

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,450
Okay, noted drunkard.

30
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,340
Gary. Henricus.

31
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,660
A horse!

32
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,740
- Henricus the Horsus?
- Yes.

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,880
You know what?
I'll ask the follow up details later.

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,090
That's how this works.

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,270
Matt.

36
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,290
Also known as Henricopolis.

37
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,220
It is a settlement.

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,392
Or was a settlement,
I should have said was.

39
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,290
Was a settlement.

40
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,810
All right.

41
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,140
- Gary.
- Yes.

42
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,860
A horse.

43
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,220
You wish for more information?

44
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,940
Well yes, is it an ancient horse?

45
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,260
Is it a modern racehorse?
Is it just some horse?

46
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,947
Just a piece of horse.

47
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:40,500
Can I say, strictly adhering to the
categories you have outlined there,

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,891
none of those.

49
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,557
- Ooh.
- Oh.

50
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:44,560
You said is it an ancient horse,

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,310
is it a modern racehorse
or is it just a horse?

52
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,370
It is none of those.
It's an old racehorse.

53
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,240
Okay.

54
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,280
It won The Grand National

55
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,540
in 1899.

56
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,560
Right.

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,280
And is notable for being the last horse
that was able to go round fences and win.

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Go round fences?

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,020
Well, yeah, because the rules
of steeplechase

60
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,530
hadn't been
formalised by that point

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,521
and no-one would have thought about
what happens if the horse just--

62
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,600
- Just dodged the fences.
- Just get through and sort of...

63
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,500
With its rider still on it.

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,380
- Oh, that's amazing.
- If it's completely out of control, didn't...

65
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,620
Obviously, there are cases in... yeah!

66
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,857
You have a loose horse.

67
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:24,070
Yeah, you have a loose horse
but it's normally shed its rider

68
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,910
whereas in this point,
the rider actually stayed on

69
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,090
but couldn't control the damn horse.

70
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,990
And so it was dodging all the fences.

71
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,300
Therefore, comes first, 'cause it's not got
the slowing down effect

72
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,460
of having to jump over the fences.

73
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,070
And so it was the last one where they said,

74
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,040
well, it's not in the rules
that you actually have

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,663
to leap over the fences with
your rider on, that kind of thing.

76
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:42,320
I... I want that to be true.

77
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,313
Well, say it is then, you prick!

78
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,876
- Yeah, just do it. Be brave.
- Just do it.

79
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,680
You don't need to know about us.
Commit to Gary for once.

80
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,107
You don't need to wait for the others.
Come on.

81
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,960
All right, first horse,
ah, no, the last horse.

82
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,700
Correct.

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,510
To go around rather than over
and still be allowed to win.

84
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,040
Yeah, it was the point then
that they changed the rules.

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,540
All right.

86
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,880
Chris, a Caeser-era drunkard.

87
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,713
Yeah!

88
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:06,840
So. Just after birth of Christ
sort-of-time,

89
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,820
early ADs, guy is born in Gaul,
sees what's going down in the Holy Land

90
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,367
and thinks, "You know what, you know what,
there's some rubes for the taking here."

91
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,340
Has a relatively uneventful childhood.

92
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,530
Picks up the bottle a little bit,
in northern France.

93
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,210
But, obviously, this is
the era of occupation,

94
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,010
you can move slowly if you have to.

95
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,860
So he decides, right, I'm going
to find the centre of empire.

96
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,530
I'm going to start my
own personality cult.

97
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,173
I'm going to become 'the guy'.

98
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,020
'Henricus' will echo through the ages.

99
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,616
Jesus: just the warm up act.

100
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,543
I know what I'm about.

101
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,443
Manages to make his way,
over about the next 10 years,

102
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,200
to the centre of the empire in Rome.

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,440
By which time he is, as you can imagine,
well tanned, knows his way around,

104
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,930
knows what's going on.

105
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,803
Sets himself up with this little cadre
who've been following, as these stories

106
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,577
have been getting grander and grander.

107
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,580
"Don't you know I came from Gaul?"

108
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,960
And X happens there and, of course,

109
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,053
the next place you go
to nobody knows that.

110
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,657
And you continue this,
and you continue this

111
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,150
and you continue this.

112
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,910
Eventually washes up in Rome

113
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,350
with this cadre of 40, 50 people,
whatever else.

114
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,547
At which point the entire empire goes,
"'Excuse me? You what?"

115
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,490
Pontificating on the steps,
debating people, as they did,

116
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,880
completely takes the rug out
from underneath him.

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,720
Everybody gets thumbs down,
lions, the whole bit.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,120
At which point he takes to
the bottle, famous drunk,

119
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,000
still shouting at the orators.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,820
I can't tell if this is a
brilliant historical story

121
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,606
or your plan if you get sent back in time.

122
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,869
What do you mean sent back in time?

123
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,591
Did you know I'm from the north?

124
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,460
It's why he came down here.

125
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,390
It's taken him all of
six months to get here.

126
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,150
Found his way to the seat of empire

127
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,690
- which is obviously--
- Yeah, that's it.

128
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,530
Matt's kitchen.

129
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,810
And Boris is going to
feed me to the lions.

130
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,520
- Yeah.
- Topical.

131
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,740
Well, that'll be out of date
by the time that goes out.

132
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,320
Right, I have zero follow up questions.
It was an excellent story, well told.

133
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,270
I just am completely unable to tell
if that is something you made up

134
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,030
or if that is just a really
good telling of the article.

135
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,113
(Tom, you know that's the game.)

136
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,260
Yes! Matt.

137
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,910
Henricopolis.

138
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,214
It's going to seem really boring
compared to that now.

139
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:48,030
But, it has a slight bit of interest,

140
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,270
in that Henrico, or Henricopolis,
it has a few names,

141
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,130
was one of the first
settlements in the New World.

142
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,903
So it was in Virginia.

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,080
And it doesn't exist anymore.
No one's quite sure where it was.

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,640
But, there is now a Henrico County
in Virginia which is named after it.

145
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,420
And in its place now is-- ish, near it,

146
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,170
is a living history centre, it said.

147
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,150
I assume that's like Beamish.

148
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,347
Yes.

149
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:21,271
Load of re-enactors and--
sorry, are you okay there, Gary?

150
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:22,907
North American Beamish.

151
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,890
"It's a bit like Beamish",
is that how they market it?

152
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,430
Henrico Living Heritage
Centre, it's a bit like Beamish.

153
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,483
There's a fair portion of the
UK where that'd work.

154
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,150
What else did it say about it?

155
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh, it's near to where Pocahontas grew up.

156
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,920
Man, that's difficult.

157
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,903
Wow.

158
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:50,736
Well done, everybody.

159
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:51,569
- Well done everybody.
- Well done, well done.

160
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,320
Well done, well done, good innings.

161
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Seen him right off.

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,100
The thing is I don't have

163
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,080
any reasonable follow-up
questions on these either.

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,510
Because you have told the
entire history of a man

165
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,260
who may or may not have been Henricus.

166
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,220
You've...

167
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,920
I just don't think...

168
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,870
Okay, Gary, I'm really sorry.

169
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,910
There's no reasonable follow-up questions
except for you, you f***.

170
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,190
"I haven't struck you out yet!"

171
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,360
I just don't think that they'd've
awarded the Grand National

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,660
to someone who went around
the edges, even then.

173
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,720
I just don't think so.

174
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,323
It's not scrub out wrong,

175
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,670
but it's certainly not my first choice.

176
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,210
He's put parentheses around you

177
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,604
and torn the piece of
paper into another--

178
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:34,437
"No."

179
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:38,110
That's a great story.

180
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,380
That's a more plausible Wikipedia article.

181
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,490
Matt, I believe you.
Am I right?

182
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,530
Yes!

183
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,363
Oh.

184
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,040
Wow!

185
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,020
Hmm.

186
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,840
I think we're all surprised by that.

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,720
Well, Matt probably wasn't.

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,520
No, I was surprised as well.

189
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,399
By what?

190
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,232
I don't know.

191
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,700
You're doing quite well today, aren't you?

192
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,943
Apparently I am.

193
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,213
Yeah.

194
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,046
Shall I go get a new article?

195
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,150
Yes.

196
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,523
So we're genuinely all stumped by
the fact that that wasn't the--

197
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,520
I know, right!

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,090
Let's just surface that here.
That was f***ing amazing!

199
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,230
I want to follow that up in a minute.

200
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,431
But, let's just...

201
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:12,890
Tell me about Henricopolis.

202
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,960
"The city, i.e. of Henricus,
also known as Henricopolis,

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,550
"Henrica Town or Henrico was
a settlement in Virginia

204
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,350
"founded by someone in
1611, as an alternative

205
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,090
"to the swampy and dangerous area

206
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,660
"around the original English
settlement of Jamestown.

207
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,060
"It was named for Prince Henry,

208
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,890
"the oldest son of King James I."

209
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,450
- Bloody hell.
- The thing that sold me on it,

210
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,500
was changing the one to Henrico
and that also being an option.

211
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,160
That's exactly the sort of thing that,
the little detail.

212
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,810
When you said it was
Henricopolis or Henricus,

213
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,057
I was just like, oh, that's nothing.

214
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,660
I'm really stalling for time.

215
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,940
Henrico County sold that, somehow, to me.

216
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,370
"The sites of Henricus is located on
a neck of land called Farrar's Island

217
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,100
"which later became part
of the Shire of Henrico

218
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,820
"and was renamed Henrico County in 1637."

219
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,518
Gary, Gary, you're--

220
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,135
Ah, I've missed a great bit!

221
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:02,968
What?

222
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:04,080
The portion of Henrico County

223
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,930
that lays south of the
James River was detached

224
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,910
to form the present day
Chesterfield County.

225
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,414
- Yes!
- Chesterfield!

226
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,167
Spireites!

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,300
I was going to say, I'm from Mansfield,
I should immediately hate the place.

228
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,430
But, Gary, did you just make that up?

229
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,096
- Yes.
- Okay.

230
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,580
That was stellar.

231
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,640
- Yours was really good.
- It was excellent.

232
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,390
Genuinely, I was half-convinced,
for a while,

233
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,757
that they would have just let someone
go around the outside.

234
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:28,900
Well, if I was there, if
it's not even in the rules,

235
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,960
I could just imagine that--

236
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,810
Yeah, exactly.

237
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,820
Well, actually, it doesn't say
you got to jump over the fences.

238
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,240
Spirit of the law, you f***ed up.

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,386
Letter of the law,
we have to give you this.

240
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,219
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,790
No, that was really, really convincing.

242
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,915
Chris, did you make that up out
of whole cloth or was that--

243
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,748
Yeah!

244
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,780
- That's outstanding.
- That was good. I like it.

245
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,860
That was outstanding work, that really is.

246
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,070
You should publish it.

247
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,783
It was really good.

248
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,200
I was believing you and
it was my bloody article.

249
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,944
Yeah, I was believing you a bit,
but f***ing hell.

250
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,510
He got that.

251
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,176
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

252
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,960
I thought it was a bit
too woolly in places but...

253
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,849
Oh, but you set the mood.

254
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:07,630
All right, Matt, again,
I'm somehow still surprised by this.

255
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,461
Could you go find a new article, please?

256
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,294
Yeah.

257
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,300
Matt's going to get a new article.

258
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm going to pick this one from the three.

259
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,780
And for the second half

260
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm going to try and
clean-sweep this again

261
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
'cause I've been doing well this series.

262
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,893
Dangers of the Engagement Period.

263
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,320
Dangers of the Engagement Period.

264
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,367
Gary.

265
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,500
[muffled noise]

266
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,140
Took a swig of tea,
thinking I was safe then.

267
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,210
Gary, Dangers of the Engagement Period.

268
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,230
Yes.

269
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,761
What is it, please?

270
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,510
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?

271
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,293
Well, I shall tell you.

272
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,350
What's behind the round window, Gary?

273
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,203
Well, I shall tell you.

274
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,080
You will see by its syntactic expression
it's a very rough translation.

275
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,140
But, it is a manual produced
by the South Korean government

276
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,630
as a lovers' guide, or a couples' guide.

277
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,630
Oh, I'm definitely going
to ask you a lot of detail

278
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,630
about that in a moment.
Thank you.

279
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,680
I read hard.

280
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
I'm sure you have.

281
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,280
Chris.

282
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,760
Dangers of the Engagement Period.

283
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,700
Is a film.

284
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,140
Ooh.

285
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,560
That's all I'm getting
on this first round?

286
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,775
-Do you want some more?
- No, it's fine.

287
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:21,280
- Matt.
- F***er!

288
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,870
Sorry. Every time I say something,
well, here's my list of follow ups,

289
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,560
these two say anything, fine.

290
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,400
How is him saying "a film"
more plausible?

291
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,280
I mean, he didn't say
"South Korean lovers' guide"?

292
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,030
And yet he always credits detail.

293
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,783
Matt.

294
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:41,520
It is a series of documentary films.

295
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,430
Documentary films, all right.

296
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,810
So I will give you a rest here Gary.

297
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,105
I'm going to ask for more
details from Chris here.

298
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:48,938
Hi!

299
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:50,330
You just said "film".

300
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,163
I did.

301
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,070
Yes, can you please be more specific?

302
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,980
It is an film that came out in 1930.

303
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,090
Oh, that's a very early film.

304
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,870
It is a German film.

305
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,703
Right.

306
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,853
It was filmed in the
Netherlands. On a train.

307
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,880
It had Marlene Dietrich in it.

308
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,101
Hold on, is there any reason
you're talking like that?

309
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,910
I don't know.

310
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,626
I did something different last time,
can't I do something different this time?

311
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,459
Sure!

312
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,300
Yeah, so those are some more details.

313
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,990
Do you want me to string
them together or do--

314
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah, go on.

315
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,500
I feel like, oh, I can do this,
say, actually, in a string.

316
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,930
Yeah, so it's a 1930s German film.

317
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,810
Oh, a 1930 German film,
starring Marlene Dietrich.

318
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,440
It was one film before
"The Blue" something

319
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,230
which was her breakout role
that sent her to Hollywood.

320
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,720
It was filmed in the Netherlands.

321
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,830
It's set on a train.

322
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,580
It is about the "dangers of engagement"
because she,

323
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,610
they're on a train that gets derailed,

324
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,560
she falls in love with the baron
she's been sharing the coach with

325
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,880
or somebody of rank.

326
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,510
And then they spend the night
falling in love more after the train's derailed.

327
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,810
And then it all goes to pot

328
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,760
because she's engaged
to his American friend

329
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
or he's engaged to her American friend.

330
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,250
And then I assume they finish the film
with Marlene Dietrich marrying this guy.

331
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,083
Right.

332
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:05,940
Happy now?

333
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,606
- Yes!
- Good!

334
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:11,220
But I'm... after the startling show
of fabrication last time.

335
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,900
I don't know what to think.
This is excellent.

336
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,480
Good.

337
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,313
Carry on.

338
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,900
I love how you're spending
most of the time confused.

339
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,610
Yeah. I really am.

340
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,480
Matt, tell me about the documentary film.

341
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,190
What are the dangers
that it's documenting?

342
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,340
South Korean novels about being...!

343
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,910
Sorry, South Korean manuals about being.

344
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,989
We'll... we'll get to that.

345
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:38,900
Look at this! I'm saving this
measly aperitif for my main course.

346
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,930
I am, because of the phrase,
"South Korean lovers' manual".

347
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,180
We're saving that one, Gary.

348
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,355
It's better than the South Korean
lovers' automatic.

349
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:51,650
- Bolt action love.
- Ohh.

350
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,470
- Matt.
- Cold war.

351
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,450
- Oh.
- Yeah.

352
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,240
I don't think I've picked
anything particularly fun

353
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,430
this time but that's what they're--

354
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,973
I was using the random button
'til I got something of some meat.

355
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,730
So this is a US, kind of,

356
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,350
it seemed like hazily
military funded thing.

357
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,190
Oh, one of those ones that turns up
on the Prelinger Archives now. Yeah, okay.

358
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,250
I haven't had that phrase before

359
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,600
but it sounds like something
that pops up on archives.

360
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,760
I recognised a still from it,
it's got that seal logo on the front--

361
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,090
- It'll be one of the public domain ones, yeah.
- Yeah.

362
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,740
So what's the engagement period?

363
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,369
So that's when the engagement of war.

364
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,202
Ah.

365
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,900
So when they believed that
they are engaging in it.

366
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,330
It's one of those duck, cover,
hide in your bathroom kind of things.

367
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,870
But, a list of all the
dangers of what they could do.

368
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,270
Even if it's not necessarily nuclear

369
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,790
'cause they have enough
nuclear-specific ones.

370
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,460
But, all the other kind of ways
they could attack.

371
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,220
There could be commies in your area,
entire section called--

372
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,393
Red Dawn! This is Red Dawn!

373
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,783
"Red On Your Street", it said.

374
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:57,890
Oh, close enough.
All right, hush my smart mouth.

375
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,790
I know!

376
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,843
To think that they say it
in such phrases and that...

377
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:04,676
But, yeah.

378
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,780
All right, that's...

379
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh, we've got some strong ones here.

380
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,648
And then we have a
South Korean lovers' manual.

381
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,564
No, I'm, teasing but--

382
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:14,120
If you use it right,
that's a strong one too.

383
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,180
Yeah, I'm teasing about
this Gary, but, honestly,

384
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,464
if your brain came up with
"South Korean lovers' manual" on its own...

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,480
I realise I say this sounds implausible
but also I don't know if that's something...

386
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,650
Like, if it was about trains, if it was about--

387
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,380
South Korean train lovers' manual?

388
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,300
If it was--

389
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,120
Train shagging?!

390
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,110
You okay there?

391
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,370
He's been spit-taking
for like 20 seconds now.

392
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,950
I had two problems there.

393
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,620
Number one, I was laughing
and I had tea in my mouth.

394
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,210
Number two, I need to descale my kettle

395
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,159
so I didn't really want
to swallow it either.

396
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,040
Urgh!

397
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:46,840
Lovely(!)

398
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,003
If you've come up with this...

399
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,870
This is not me saying,
"This is implausible".

400
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,506
This is me saying,
"This is going to be good".

401
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:59,110
Either because it's come from your head
or because you went through Wikipedia

402
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,850
until you found
"South Korean lovers' manual"

403
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,923
and then went, "Oh."

404
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,963
Do tell.

405
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,440
Produced by the South Korean government
in the wake of the Korean war.

406
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,050
Because you had a lot of, well, all right,
let's face it, it's blatantly sexist, isn't it?

407
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,460
Their target audience was young girls

408
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,600
who were getting engaged
to American soldiers.

409
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,266
- Ah.
- Oh.

410
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,690
The problem being then, is that,

411
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,700
the American soldier
inevitably moves home,

412
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,120
it all breaks down,
they get very disappointed,

413
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,280
it's causing all sorts of, what you would
call today, mental health issues.

414
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,380
So the point was to point out,
if you're getting engaged to someone

415
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,200
and you're very much in love and you
get engaged and it's all fine,

416
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,800
actually, he might go home,
it might all fall apart.

417
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,160
You will be very disappointed in love.

418
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,740
And these are the things that
you should be thinking about

419
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,290
when you're on your path
to getting married.

420
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,940
So it's kind of a
marriage-training sort of thing.

421
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,840
So "lovers' guide" is one way
of putting it.

422
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,320
Another way is marriage-training
but also warning text

423
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,270
that says, if you're going
to get engaged to a GI,

424
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,850
bear in mind, he might
already have a wife,

425
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,480
go home, leave you, dump you.

426
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
Or if you are going to stay with him,

427
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,700
here's all the things he needs
to know when he's in Korea,

428
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,220
here's all the things you need
to think about as a couple.

429
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,710
I want it to be that.

430
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,543
Yeah.

431
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,333
And you thought it was
going to be about f***ing!

432
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,703
- That's the point--
- That's chapter three!

433
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,030
This is, without doubt,
the most difficult one of this entire run.

434
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,030
Good Lord.

435
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,450
It's almost like we've had some practise.

436
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,660
And I should have had some practise.

437
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,633
And I've been picking
this quite well so far.

438
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,800
But I just don't know.

439
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,780
Which chapter's that?

440
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,100
Four.

441
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,286
- Marlene Dietrich.
- Yeah.

442
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,970
I think the dates are right.

443
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,513
I like the story around it.

444
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,043
I just...

445
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,740
I just, something in that
doesn't feel right.

446
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,473
You okay there?

447
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,370
Matt, "Red On Your Street" is--

448
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,710
Awesome.

449
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,790
Almost entirely convincing
but I don't think 'engagement period'

450
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,260
is the sort of thing the US military
would use for that.

451
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,720
I think this is the
first time I've done this

452
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,060
in this whole run we've
filmed in this block.

453
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,000
Gary, I think it's you.

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,833
Am I right?

455
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,769
No.

456
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:07,602
Ahh!

457
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:15,300
The one time I go for your option,
Brannan, the one time.

458
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,880
The one time you give me time
to f***ing think of something!

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,130
Oh, that was, oh, right, okay.

460
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,563
So we're down to the Marlene Dietrich film
or Red On Your Street.

461
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,230
Chris.

462
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,290
Filmed in Scheveningen in the Netherlands.

463
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,870
Well reviewed by Lotte Eisner.

464
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,700
Oh.

465
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,560
Points to Chris!

466
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Can I tell you Matt, Red On Your Street--

467
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,920
- No, points to Gary.
- Points to me.

468
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,460
Yeah, point to Gary, point to Gary.

469
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Red On Your Street, that was the detail
that nearly made me go for...

470
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,528
You okay there?

471
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,558
...kettle!

472
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:52,391
Kettle?

473
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:53,224
He needs to descale his kettle.

474
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:54,297
You need to descale your kettle.

475
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:55,680
It was fine earlier though, wasn't it?

476
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,667
It were all right then, yeah.

477
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,390
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

478
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,050
Congratulations to whoever won.

479
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,730
I haven't been keeping track of the scores
and you shouldn't have either.

480
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,699
Bye!

481
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:06,532
Bye.
