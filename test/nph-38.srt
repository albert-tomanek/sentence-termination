1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,260
As I record this,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,400
the Unicode Consortium has just announced 250 new emoji.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,900
And

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,140
there was much rejoicing.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,940
Um

6
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,900
unfortunately they include things like

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,780
"Man in Business Suit Levitating".

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,220
And there's a reason for that and, *sigh*

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,060
Well, it's a good question, which is

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,220
"Why are emoji in there in the first place?"

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,660
I've talked about Unicode before. It's meant to be this  universal language.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,240
Well no, universal code, that includes every other language.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,380
It's meant to contain every single script

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,700
every single character you could possibly put down

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,020
that has any meaning.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
I mean it's got "Linear A" in it now

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
which is an ancient language that no one understands

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,440
but the characters from it
are in Unicode.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,100
And, well, so are emoji.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,400
But why? They're not something that you'd deliberately draw.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,160
They're not doodle-able in the middle of a sentence in scrolled written languages.

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,720
But they're in here.

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,480
And the reason goes back to the 1990's.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,580
And...

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,400
Well it's an example of a standard

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,940
that the rest of the world imposed on us English speakers.

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,499
1999, and we go to Japan.

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,500
Now Japan at that point had

29
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,120
well

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,200
kind of like walled-off private mobile internets.

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,640
It kind of had web access on the cell phone something close to it.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,060
But really it was like AOL used to be, if you remember that.

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,800
They used to try and funnel everyone through their browser and their platform

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,720
And the Japanese mobile phone companies made that happen.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,740
There was one called DoCoMo which had i-mode.

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm probably mispronouncing that but I'm an English speaker so that's what I do.

37
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,100
um

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,820
And the idea was, well,

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,600
we've got enough bandwidth to send text.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
That's about all.

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,700
We can't send pictures. But

42
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,660
what we could do, 'cause

43
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,300
we're not using ASCII, we're not using the

44
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,940
the standard English speaking code

45
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,520
that says "A" is one byte and "B" is another byte.

46
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:49,340
We're sending Japanese characters.

47
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,260
We're essentially sending pairs of bytes that say

48
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,840
"Put this picture in."

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
"Put this character in."

50
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,969
So why don't we make some of those characters

51
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,960
pictures?

52
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,560
Why don't we add a smiley face?

53
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,940
Why don't we add a few other things?

54
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,480
And one engineer, Shigetaka Kurita,

55
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,380
watch me looking at my notes to make sure I get that name right.

56
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,040
Um

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,320
Shigetaka Kurita came up with a list of a 176 characters.

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,540
And they were characters, they were just 12 by 12 pixel grids.

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,880
Really, really simple.

60
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,420
And they were pretty much arbitrarily chosen by him and whoever he asked.

61
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,830
They included a couple of company logos, for crying out loud.

62
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,830
They included the sponsors of i-mode.

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,820
And the idea was

64
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,740
they would install those on the phones that they sent out to users.

65
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,900
And so instead of having to send a picture

66
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,020
they would just send a character code.

67
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
Same as for any other Japanese character.

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,680
And if you're using an i-mode phone you would send a smiley face

69
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,320
and a smiley face would come out the other end.

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,260
Which was great if you were both using i-mode phones.

71
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,380
But then all the other network providers came up with their own lists of emoji,

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,360
generally different.

73
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,100
Not in all,

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,780
but in most of the characters

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,120
they chose different ones that has different interpretation.

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,080
So if you sent one character from an i-mode phone

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
to someone on another network

78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,700
then it wouldn't come through as intended.

79
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,010
That's the first stage.

80
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,690
Stage two.

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,140
Along comes the Unicode Consortium.

82
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,200
And they say, "Right. All these encoding of all your letters,

83
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,859
we're just going to put them into one central thing."

84
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,000
"We're gonna put them into Unicode. Everyone can agree on it."

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,720
"You can send your documents internationally."

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,600
Brilliant.

87
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,080
Except

88
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,160
all the Japanese people consulting on this said,

89
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,860
"Great you're putting emoji in there as well, right?"

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,720
And the Unicode Consortium had a very long and very pitched battle about this

91
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,540
and eventually decided that

92
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,640
yes, emoji would be going in.

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,840
Because one of their their goals is that

94
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,040
you should be able to translate two-ways.

95
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,600
You should be able to translate documents into Unicode

96
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,920
and out of it.

97
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,140
So you need emoji in there or you're gonna lose data.

98
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,040
So,

99
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,220
in go the emoji.

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
That's stage 2.

101
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,040
Stage 3.

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,540
Apple comes along. And we're a few years later now.

103
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Apple is launching the iPhone in Japan.

104
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,420
And one of the first complaints they get back is,
"It doesn't have emoji."

105
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,309
"We can't ... it's just coming through as junk."

106
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,580
So Apple in iOS 2, way way back when,

107
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,860
adds emoji.

108
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,660
But you needed a Japanese SIM card in there, and

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
no one really noticed.

110
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,280
iOS 4, iOS 5 come along.

111
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,660
They decide,

112
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,700
"Well we might as well turn this on for everyone. Everyone's using Unicode now."

113
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,720
"So let's just add a keyboard in there that says: emoji."

114
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
It wasn't meant to go worldwide.

115
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,340
It was never ever meant to become as big as it did.

116
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,620
And yet,

117
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,640
someone noticed,

118
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,200
"Oh, I can I can have ..."

119
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,000
-- why am i not holding my phone for this? -- someone went,

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
"Oh, I can add an emoji keyboard, there's a setting in there."

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
And then

122
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,180
they sent

123
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,380
a smiley face.

124
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm going to pretend it with a smiley face.

125
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,620
Let's be honest, it was almost certainly the little pile of poo.

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,500
They sent it to their friend.

127
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,580
And their friend with an iPhone said, "That's amazing!"

128
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,460
"This is brilliant! How do I turn that on?"

129
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,360
And they did.

130
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,340
And they sent it to their friend, and they sent it to their friend.

131
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,840
Accidentally, Apple had created something

132
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,560
wonderfully viral,

133
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,940
just by turning on a hidden setting.

134
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,640
So that when massive.

135
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,640
And all of a sudden all the other phone companies are,

136
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,040
Android, Microsoft are going,

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,020
"Oh, we've gotta add this as well because

138
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,600
people are texting these emojis to Android phones

139
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,100
and

140
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,680
and we're not understanding them!"

141
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,510
So they added it.

142
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,360
Um

143
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,740
Web browsers now have to try and cope with it.

144
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,240
Uh

145
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,760
Firefox does very well.

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,240
Firefox will look through the other fonts on your system for emoji and use them if it can.

147
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,540
Chrome fails somewhat, there's all kinds of hacks being put in there.

148
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,860
Everyone is trying to add emoji to their systems.

149
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Again, never intended to go this far.

150
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,840
But

151
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,140
here we are.

152
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,260
And then, well

153
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
people who don't understand where this came from

154
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,060
-- which is, let's be honest, pretty much everyone --

155
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,740
are looking at the list of pictures and they're going,

156
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,580
"Apple,"

157
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,540
-- 'cause they've assumed this is an Apple thing --

158
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,320
"Apple, why have you added

159
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,460
bento box?"

160
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,560
"But not say, taco?"

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,820
"And what is a bento box?" It's a kind of lunch box.

162
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,760
They've said, "Apple, why have you had this kind of weird

163
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,480
five-pointed

164
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,680
blossom with a circle in it and some
writing?"

165
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,370
It's actually this stamp that a Japanese teacher would put on school child's work to say, well done.

166
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,400
And they're saying,

167
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,380
"Apple, why have you added a symbol for
'love hotel' ?"

168
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,800
"And what is a 'love hotel' ?"

169
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,060
And I'm not answering that on this video.

170
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,080
More importantly

171
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,240
they've said,

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
"Apple,"

173
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,260
"why isn't they're anyone black in here?"

174
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,660
Now that's that's a whole cultural context I'm really not

175
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,700
qualified to comment on. But it is still

176
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,540
a massive oversight. And Apple

177
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,820
have the, well, fairly reasonable
defense that they're following the standard.

178
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Because it was never meant to be worldwide.

179
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,160
This was settled on by one Japanese engineer and a couple of his friends.

180
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,719
What? Nearly

181
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,580
20 years earlier?

182
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,320
That engineer never meant this to go worldwide.

183
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Never really meant it to be used outside Japan.

184
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,760
And yet,

185
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,120
here we are.

186
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,020
So

187
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,380
Unicode 7 has just come out.

188
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,120
And this is the excitement. And this is,

189
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,340
"Oh we've got new emojis."

190
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,700
"We've got new things to play with."

191
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,800
So when it finally goes on to your phone

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
you'll be able to scroll through the list. And you'll be able to say,

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
"Oh, brilliant! They've added a

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,940
a portable stereo boombox!" like it was the 1990's.

195
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,880
And you'll be able to say,

196
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,620
"Oh! They've added a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk!"

197
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,960
like it's the 1980's.

198
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,080
And they say, "Oh! They've added"

199
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,480
-- I'm not kidding here --

200
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,180
"they've added a 'no piracy' symbol."

201
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,820
And the 'no piracy' symbol,

202
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,500
I am not joking here, is

203
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,840
a man with a beard

204
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,880
and an eye patch

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
and a big Ghostbusters 'no' symbol through it.

206
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,140
They've added Wingdings.

207
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,340
They have added the entirety of Wingdings.

208
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,880
You remember wingdings, right? It's

209
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,480
It's the

210
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
it's the font that was from Windows 3.1 that

211
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,420
that had all the little symbols in it.

212
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
It has... I'm not gonna try and draw this.

213
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,460
You are going to have to superimpose this in post somewhere.

214
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,340
They have added

215
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,540
"Man in Business Suit Levitating".

216
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
That's the formal title.

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,260
It was meant to look like an exclamation mark and some kind of

218
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,020
record company's logo, I don't know.

219
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,320
But that's what's in Unicode.

220
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,010
Those are your 250 new emojis.

221
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
They are from Wingdings.

222
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,940
Why?

223
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,540
And I know the reason why.

224
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,040
And the reason why actually does make a little bit of sense.

225
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,750
The Unicode Consortium has looked at all the old documents out there that use Wingdings.

226
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
They are looking at the emails that are still going round

227
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,360
that have a "J" them for no good reason, because

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Wingdings mapped "smiley face" to "J".

229
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,320
So if you put a Wingdings "smiley face" in there and it gets mangled along on the way

230
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,320
it'll come out as a "J".

231
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,500
And *sigh*

232
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,060
and they're looking at this, and they're saying,

233
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,640
"Right. We can convert these to Unicode. That's going to be our priority."

234
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,140
Which

235
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
makes an odd sort of sense.

236
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,340
But it doesn't

237
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,100
solve

238
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,540
any of the cultural problems.

239
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,740
I mean it just adds new ones.

240
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,950
What you have here

241
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,820
is the equivalent

242
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,540
of those original emoji.

243
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,840
You have some symbols that were decided on

244
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,280
literally a quarter of a century ago

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,280
by some engineers

246
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
in Microsoft.

247
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,300
*sigh*

248
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,100
We haven't solved any problems.

249
00:08:59,370 --> 00:08:59,910
Not yet.

250
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,500
I mean Unicode 8

251
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,500
hopefully will come along because there is now

252
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,720
a massive bun fight going on

253
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,700
about what symbols and what emoji get added to kind of

254
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,940
equalize things in Unicode 8. And that's great.

255
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,340
But it also worries me

256
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,840
because what we have here is essentially a language.

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,900
We have

258
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,900
some letters

259
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,680
that are decided on

260
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,140
by a committee.

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,960
And that

262
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,620
makes me ...

263
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,700
Actually that's probably not quite the right emoji.

264
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,460
There's going to be one in here that sums it up ...

265
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,520
... somewhere in  here ...

266
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,920
(fading) I want ...

267
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,580
(barely audible) Ok, not those ...

268
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,800
We'd like to thank audible.com for sponsoring this Computerphile video.

269

for the chance to check one out for free.

271
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,340
Today I'd like to recommend "The Most Human Human" by Brian Christian

272
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,020
It all surrounds this Turing Test,

273
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,640
the idea of, can a computer pretend to be human?

274
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,020
And if that is the case, then what makes humans human?

275
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,780
Um

276
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,400
Really really fascinating stuff, so check that out.

277
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Get over to audible.com/computerphile

278
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,080
And thanks once again to them for sponsoring this Computerphile video

279
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,680
[Tom Scott] You need something that's going to work more or less for ASCII,

280
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,780
or at least not break things but still be understood.

281
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,440
So what you do is you start by writing ...
