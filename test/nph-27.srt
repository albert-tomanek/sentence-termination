1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
[Sean, off camera]  If you're in the UK, and you know, you're using these services from abroad,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,880
[Sean] how does that affect?
[Professor Anderson] Well,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,740
um, I have been speaking to people

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,340
in the big service companies, and an example

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,840
of the thing that they suffer, and that really bothers them

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,740
is this:  Suppose you're Google.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,740
The sort of thing that turns up

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,740
is that a family court in India

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,740
grants an order saying that you must hand over the Gmail

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,580
of somebody living in Canada

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,580
who's never been in India, and you must

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,580
keep quiet about it forever.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,580
And this really puts you in a bind, because

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
how can you simultaneously employ

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,580
engineers in India, and

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,580
give believable assurances of privacy

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,380
to your users in Canada?

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,000
If you're an international company, you want to do both.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, what's been happening up to now, is that

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,860
the service companies have been directing all these requests

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,000
to lawyers in California.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
And this is really driving law enforcement, um,

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,580
blue in the face with frustration.

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,700
Because it means that to get hold of stuff,

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,460
they've got to fill out forms, submit them to the U.S. embassy,

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,700
wait for months, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,120
Now, in order to deal with this problem,

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,500
what we really need is a new Cyber Evidence convention,

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,320
like the Cybercrime Convention

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,600
That is, we need an international agreement

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,160
which says that if courts in country A

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,160
want access to data in country B,

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,500
they should be able to get it quickly,

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
but subject to some rules.

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
And these rules are gonna have to include

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
firstly, transparency; so that

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,560
you get to know who got access to what, when;

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,400
you know, once the case starts,

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
or once somebody gets arrested, or whatever.

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Second, there's got to be respect for jurisdiction,

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
so if a court in India wants to

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,440
compel production of a Canadian's data,

43
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,560
it's got to be run past a court in Canada as well.

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,020
And thirdly, there's got to be judicial warrants.

45
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Because, in many countries,

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,840
you can't get access to stuff

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,200
unless an independent party -- a judge or a magistrate --

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,520
has been convinced that there's probable cause

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,960
and has signed a piece of paper to that effect.

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,540
Now, the UK government doesn't like that,

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,380
because they want such things to be done secretly.

52
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,080
They want warrants to be signed by ministers,

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
rather than by judges.

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
And they don't want to be hidebound by jurisdiction.

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,880
They want to be able to get at stuff in other people's countries as well.

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,560
And that's because

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,140
interception and surveilance in Britain

58
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,460
is driven by the intelligence agencies

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,160
rather than by the police.

60
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,920
And so long as *their* priorities are

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,160
what drive policy, then the police are

62
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,780
gonna continue to lose out,

63
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
and law enforcement is going to suffer.
