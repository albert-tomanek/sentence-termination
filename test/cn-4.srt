1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,431
This is the Technical Difficulties

2
00:00:01,431 --> 00:00:03,443
and we are 
Two Of These People Are Lying,

3
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:05,341
because two of these people will be.

4
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,840
- Joining me are: Chris Joel.
- Hello.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,729
- Gary Brannan.
- Hot and spicy casserole... by the yard.

6
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,286
And Matt Gray.

7
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:15,400
Is that a length or is it outside?

8
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,972
That's the noise your
mother made lasht night(!)

9
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:31,336
Anyway, the way this game works
is the three of us have all random-ish-ly

10
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:35,571
picked some Wikipedia articles
and written down the names or titles

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:38,434
of those articles on these pieces of card.

12
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,892
Tom is now going to pick
one of those articles

13
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:44,267
and all three of us will claim
that it's the one that we chose

14
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:47,687
and claim that we know anything about it.

15
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,241
What happens though is only one of us

16
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,169
is telling the truth and
two of us are telling a lie.

17
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:55,800
And today we are talking
about Ghost Festival.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,480
Yes, it is annoying me that this is
slightly at a jaunty angle on here.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
And I can't decide which way to hold it.

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,072
Ghost Festival, let's go
around the table on this one.

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,080
Matt, what is Ghost Festival?

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,640
It's actually "Hhost" Festival
and it's in Croatia.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,180
Okay, uh, Gary, what's Ghost Festival?

24
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,396
A spiritual celebration in China.

25
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,934
Spiritual celebration in China.

26
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:22,860
Chris?

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,761
A series of minor vehicular events in
the American Midwest.

28
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,252
"Minor vehicular events"?

29
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,576
Okay, that was a horrible
way to phrase it.

30
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:34,692
It was a little festival that popped up in

31
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:39,262
the late 2010's when ghost riding
was big "on the YouTubes, yo".

32
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:41,879
Where you would gather
together in your mini-truck

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,784
or other vehicle and
ghost ride around a town,

34
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:46,335
well probably not around a town,

35
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:49,344
probably at some pre-determined car park
or some s***.

36
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:50,980
For young'uns out there, ghost riding?

37
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,040
Keeping your car moving while stepping

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,448
outside it doing funny poses,
generally styling it out,

39
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,190
probably not an accurate
phrase for the subculture,

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,040
so sue me!

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,280
And obviously as anything
gets big, somebody goes

42
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,600
"I'll do a festival!

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,544
"I can't afford or be bothered
to organise a festival..."

44
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,797
then somebody else takes it
over, then it dies in ignominy.

45
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,031
That's how most of these things work.

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
- Yeah.
- Where's Ignominy?

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,520
In the American Midwest!

48
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,000
Actually there is almost certainly a town
called, like, Ignominy, Nebraska isn't there?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,631
Also, also, you'd watch that
Western wouldn't you?

50
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,227
- What?
- The Town Called Ignominy.

51
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,185
Oh yeah.

52
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:27,815
Mind you, that's probably
like, what's his name,

53
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,125
Bergman does a Western,

54
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,824
just a lot of people sat there going--

55
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,480
Is "Birdman" Batman's brother?

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,240
Bergman, not Birdman!

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,322
I thought you said Birdman as well, sorry.

58
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,218
Ingmar Birdman? [squawks]

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh Ingmar Ber-- I know Ingmar Bergman!
I just thought you said "Birdman".

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
You're playing chess
with death but it is--

61
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:44,582
[squawks]

62
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,584
But it's a f***er wrecked as a crow.

63
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,107
"Actually I think you'll find that is
the accurate imagery, hm."

64
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:50,957
- "With respect to there of, hm."
- "Hmm, hmm, yes."

65
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:55,141
Ghost riding festival
in the-- the wilds of America?

66
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,072
Well not really the wilds, but the Midwest.

67
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,262
The flat bits, you don't want to do it
on a steep hill do you?

68
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,845
Not California, not New York.

69
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,124
- Bit in the middle.
- Downhill ghost riding.

70
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:10,244
Oh that's risky, that's risky, just
keep running to catch up with it.

71
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:12,928
- It's like cheese-rolling but vehicular.
- With a car!

72
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,413
Spiritual celebration in China?

73
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:16,246
Yes.

74
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,207
Do you know anything more about it?

75
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:19,408
It's a spiritual celebration in China

76
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,932
where they celebrate ghosts
is the short answer.

77
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,479
Gary, I'm just going to remind you--

78
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,091
I know the bloody rules,
I'm working my way round it all right?

79
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,679
You're going to have to
convince me that it's true.

80
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,512
Sometimes--

81
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,492
You don't get a point if
it is true on your side

82
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,071
and you convince me it's false.

83
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,479
Sometimes these articles, you have to be
blunt at the start, when you say

84
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,601
"what is a spiritual
celebration in China?"

85
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,959
the answer is it's a spiritual
celebration in China,

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,401
I think it's in the
seventh month of the year

87
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:45,605
you celebrate your--
celebrate ghosts,

88
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,657
they're unleashed from hell
and they come round

89
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:51,720
and this is what you're going to be like,
"you're making this up" but I'm not,

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,206
the ghosts have very thin necks
'cause they're not allowed to eat.

91
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,037
So you leave food out for them and stuff

92
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,662
but they're not allowed to eat
because they're ghosts

93
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:01,037
- they have lots of celebrations...
- He's just writing "t***"!

94
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,399
I know!
And it's pronounced 'thwaite'.

95
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,686
Thin necks, I'm writing thin necks!

96
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,282
Right, and you burn paper,
you have lanterns

97
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,281
and all that kind of stuff,
as you have in any of these

98
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,030
traditional Eastern celebrations.

99
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,068
It's probably a little bit like Day of the Dead
in Mexico, that kind of thing.

100
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,734
Not the film?
Not the film!

101
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,502
You can make a film of it I suppose.

102
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,485
What something really artsy and slow?

103
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:26,667
Really thin-necked ghosts.

104
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,599
Matt, it's a celebration in Croatia?

105
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,497
It's a festival rather than a celebration

106
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,318
but it's not like a music festival

107
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:37,568
it was 2011, it only ran for one year,

108
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,565
in an old, I can't think
of the word, mansion-y

109
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,114
like what's a cliff mansion called?

110
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,246
- Scary.
- Clifford.

111
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:46,657
Clifford the...?!

112
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,888
Clifford the cliff-top mansion?

113
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,920
That's a very different kids' book!

114
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,578
It's in an old house on a hill.

115
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,776
No, no, hold on, hold on we're still--

116
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,793
Clifford the big red mansion!

117
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:02,220
"All the children wanted
to play in Clifford

118
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,124
"but Clifford was too dangerous..."

119
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:06,580
Is that the one in Scarborough that
fell off the cliff that time?

120
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,562
Clifford the big red brick mansion.

121
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:09,622
Croatia, Matt?

122
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:13,577
It is a music, but
also creative arts festival

123
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:17,202
happening in a big house in Croatia

124
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:20,055
and it's got catacombs or tombs--

125
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:21,035
Ooh, say that again.

126
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,705
It's got catacombs or tombs--

127
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,010
Oh, that was less good that time.

128
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,496
Within the tombs there
are people, I don't know,

129
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:29,521
showing their wares, doing
like little arty things

130
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,956
and a few bands played in
the ballroom of it as well.

131
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:35,871
There weren't any I'd heard of.

132
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,744
- Well, it was Croatia in 2011?
- Yeah.

133
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,175
It's a small festival in--

134
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:41,091
It's before it got popular but, yeah.

135
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,170
See I was really hoping that I'd be able
to throw one of these out immediately.

136
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,047
Well just chuck Gary's, that's standard.

137
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,060
Yeah that's just standard, isn't it, yeah.

138
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,396
Have you been to the place he mentioned?

139
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:53,242
No, I'm not chucking Gary's,
'cause Gary's sounds,

140
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,121
Gary's the one I'm most
sure about at this point.

141
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,093
Well!

142
00:05:57,093 --> 00:06:00,212
I like "minor vehicular events".

143
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,199
I really wish I'd not used that phrase!

144
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,498
Get a T-shirt with that on.

145
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,696
"I like minor vehicular events."

146
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,385
But I feel like it would have
been "Ghost Riding Festival",

147
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,936
something like that, it
don't think it would've

148
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,238
made it to Wikipedia so
I don't think it's that.

149
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,868
Have you see what's on Wikipedia?

150
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,701
I was going to say, having
trawled through some s***

151
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,147
on the train today, to
come up with articles...

152
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,267
Matt, I like everything about it

153
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,182
and it sounds like an
event I'd like to see

154
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,974
but the thing that killed it for me

155
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:28,388
was you going "it's
pronounced Hhost Festival"

156
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,832
Yeah, it has the IPA in the front of it,

157
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,481
it made no sense,
it didn't describe it but it

158
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:36,003
I'm obviously guessing the
IPA, 'cause I can't read IPA

159
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,245
but it didn't look like
what I would've expected.

160
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,708
If it was Ghost Festival
it wouldn't have had the IPA right?

161
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,662
Yeah, yeah. That's for
International Phonetic Alphabet

162
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,065
Not India Pale Ale, Gary.

163
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,432
I was kind of hoping
there, I mean--

164
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:51,329
Gary, I think it's you.

165
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,036
I think, and this might just be something
dredged off my mind that I'm confusing

166
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,847
with some other festival
that I've heard of

167
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:00,212
but Gary, I think it's you, am I right?

168
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,596
You think I'd be telling the truth
about the festival of thin-necked ghosts

169
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,859
that aren't allowed to eat?

170
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,125
Yes.

171
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,465
Correct!
Yes!

172
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:14,389
It is-- I shall reveal the legend--

173
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,293
"During the month the gates
of hell are opened up

174
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:19,087
"and ghosts are free to
roam the Earth where they

175
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,960
"seek food and entertainment."

176
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,285
Rather like opening up an
old people's home.

177
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,720
"These ghosts are believed to be ancestors
of those who forgot to pay tribute to them

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,326
"after they died, or those never given
proper ritual send off.

179
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:32,210
"They have long needle-thin
necks because they have not

180
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,208
"been fed by their family,
or as a punishment

181
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,832
"so that they are unable to swallow."

182
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:36,665
Right!

183
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,463
"Family members offer prayers
to their deceased relatives,

184
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,458
"offer food and drink,"
this is the best bit,

185
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,145
"and burn hell bank notes"!

186
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,876
- I've heard of that!
- What?

187
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:49,553
They're special paper fake bank notes,
made for the ceremony, I've heard of that.

188
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,952
Yeah, Gary, congratulations,
a point to you.

189
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:52,785
Yay!

190
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,260
- A point to me for guessing correctly
- Boo!

191
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,900
which I'm quite happy about.

192
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,917
And Gary, you need to go and find
a new article for the second half.

193
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,823
Gary has gone and got a new article.

194
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,898
I'm going to pick one
at random from this pile

195
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:03,731
Have you shuffled?

196
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,382
I have shuffled thoroughly!

197
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,050
- Thoroughly?
- Thorough-shuffle.

198
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,737
- How horrible.
- I know! And we have...

199
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,643
the 1878 North Lancashire by-election.

200
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:24,298
Now, there are a few things I can guess
from this title: it's a by-election,

201
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:26,965
in North Lancashire, in 1878, so

202
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,270
no, you know what?

203
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,748
Maybe it isn't, maybe it's something else.

204
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,297
I'm going to start with Chris this time.

205
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:36,774
The 1878 North Lancashire by-election

206
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,180
was a by-election in
North Lancashire, in 1878.

207
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,232
Do you want to tell me
something special about it?

208
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,023
Why on earth does that
have a Wikipedia article?

209
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,465
It happened on the 8th of April

210
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:52,091
because some guy, first
name or surname was Stanley,

211
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:57,981
I forget which, who was the incumbent
got made minister of, no, general--

212
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,000
- Crabs!
- No!

213
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:07,115
Had to go to hospital due
to unforeseen circumstances

214
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,560
with a lady that wasn't his
wife, don't write this down,

215
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,766
this is about me and
him talking about crabs.

216
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:12,974
Alright, okay.

217
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:17,498
Because he got made,
what's high up? Not Prime Minister--

218
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,180
Privy Councillor?
No, next--

219
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,836
Cabinet?
Yeah, something--

220
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:21,669
First Sea Lord?

221
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,061
Minister of war, something of war,

222
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,526
Chief something of war.

223
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:27,973
Alright.
Chief of War!

224
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:30,615
Boss of War, but not right
at the top of the tree.

225
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:34,738
Alright, incidentally, yes,
there is a First Sea Lord.

226
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,971
That's the head of the sea.

227
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,637
- Yes.
- The head of the Navy, isn't it?

228
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,940
He's King Navy.

229
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,720
I do like the fact that if we,
if Britain ever has a Space Force,

230
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,065
there will be the First Space Lord.

231
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,384
You'd have the job just for
the title, wouldn't you?

232
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:47,464
Marvel will sue.

233
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:48,689
Oh yeah, fair.

234
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:52,774
Lord of Space, just enough
to get round the trademark.

235
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:56,639
Slightly different theme-tune, just
two or three notes off-key at the end.

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,144
Gary, the 1878 North
Lancashire by-election?

237
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:07,112
That was a by-election held for the
North Lancashire constituency in 1878, which...

238
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,178
smart-arse...

239
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,500
is notable for the
winning candidate being dead.

240
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,792
Oh, now I know that's
definitely happened in the past.

241
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,765
Alright, winning candidate being dead.

242
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,355
Can't have happened in the future...?

243
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,579
Alright, Matt, the 1878
North Lancashire by-election?

244
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,630
- It didn't happen.
- Oh!

245
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,552
It was due to happen but it didn't.

246
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:34,686
Alright, let's... so we've got
one where the incumbent

247
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,141
became Minister of War--

248
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:39,341
Whatever it is, I feel like it was
a longer title than that.

249
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:42,455
Alright, one where the
winning candidate was dead

250
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,721
and one where it just didn't happen.

251
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,215
Matt, why didn't it happen?

252
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:48,658
Agricultural protests.

253
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:49,747
Oh!

254
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:54,960
All of the candidates were...
what's the word, seeming to be

255
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,133
championing a lot of the
newer technologies of the time

256
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,992
and all of the factory kind of stuff,

257
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:05,270
and that was driving work
away from the farmland.

258
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,853
So a farmer's union, were
tying to recognise the fact

259
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:13,883
that no one was representing them
and protested the by-election.

260
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,552
Like, tractors everywhere and stuff.

261
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,191
There's absolutely nothing
funny about that but--

262
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,121
I dunno, "tractors everywhere" is
sentence of the week as far as I'm concerned!

263
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,729
Opens under-stairs cupboard: tractor!

264
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:27,392
Just kind of rearing up and going for you.

265
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:29,133
Out of the fields!

266
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,740
"Thank you, mother, for the gruel -- aargh!"

267
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,183
They've got, like, bouncy suspension.

268
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:35,865
Ghosts riding their tractors!

269
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:38,823
I was just thinking Alfred Hitchcock's
'The Birds' but with tractors.

270
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,147
What, flying around a
room with Tippi Hedren?

271
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,147
Yes! Yes. Exactly that.

272
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,420
In a phone box!

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,633
Gary, the main candidate was dead?
What happened then?

274
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,651
Well he kind of got buried,
which is the normal thing that happens.

275
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,291
I though you were going
to say he got better!

276
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,691
Was there then another
by-election or did he actually--

277
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,100
Well, yes there was, because the winner,
I stress again,

278
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,360
was dead.

279
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,315
I mean, they haven't, you know--

280
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,559
Didn't he just serve out his term
very quietly in the corner?

281
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,110
Well it's 1878, maybe they didn't have
a procedural for that.

282
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,333
So you think they just transported a
flipping corpse to the House of Commons?

283
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,117
No! I just thought there'd be an empty chair!

284
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,115
It would've been more
useful than some of them.

285
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,365
Wheeey!

286
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,181
Unexpectedly ended up
briefly Prime Minister

287
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,500
around about the start
of the First World War

288
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,160
Like, the rod up the back to stay upright.

289
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,141
Someone had to crouch behind him to give
the maiden speech. What is this?

290
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:37,500
Weekend at Bernie's, only
parliamentary?

291
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,020
Weekend at Black Rod's!

292
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,340
No, he was dead, you prat!

293
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:45,320
I said that at the start,
stone actual dead.

294
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,481
He died during the course of the count.

295
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,351
Yes-- during the course of the count?

296
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,601
- Yes.
- "One, aha ha ha!"

297
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,627
Takes hours.

298
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,575
Not during the campaign, during the count?

299
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,467
Well, if he'd died during the campaign
it would be rather unfair to elect him.

300
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,169
- You'd think most people--
- This is what I was...

301
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,857
Right, exactly!
This is why I was confused.

302
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,581
He died in the course of the count,

303
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,860
so during the course of
the counting of the ballots

304
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,703
he had a heart attack and died,

305
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,659
or collapsed, you know
you assuming these things,

306
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,302
no one actually looked too closely
but, he were dead.

307
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,319
And then won?

308
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:18,762
Well he'd died but no one had realised,

309
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:21,813
they just thought he hadn't turned up
for the announcement of the result

310
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,040
so they read it all out,

311
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,900
The Member, I think it was Lord Stanley
or something, was duly elected

312
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:29,798
as a representative of the constituency
of North Lancashire and he's, you know--

313
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:30,819
Julie was elected?

314
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,879
Yeah, well he's dead isn't he?
Somebody's got to...

315
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,220
So obviously, it takes time for them to organise another by-election,

316
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,821
you can't just go
"oh shall we just have another go"?

317
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:42,882
So for a brief period of time,
their representative was,

318
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,994
and I stress this again,
a corpse.

319
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:45,930
All right.

320
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,295
And may I say he's one
of the best they had.

321
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,198
Corpses or politicians?

322
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,031
Yes.

323
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,070
Hoo. Gary...

324
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,959
- Good god!
- Gary, I'm going to rule you out.

325
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,884
I'm going to rule you out
because I think that's

326
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:02,047
just a story from
somewhere else that you've

327
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,916
tacked on to that and I
don't think it's yours.

328
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,580
The man is, of course, an expert in

329
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,644
late nineteenth century
North Lancashire politics.

330
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:13,772
I refuse to believe you know anything
about anything from Lancashire.

331
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:15,197
That's fair.

332
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:18,576
And I know it just for
the pure price of mockery.

333
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,993
I genuinely can't pick between you two.

334
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:29,128
I think if it didn't happen,
there wouldn't be an article about it.

335
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:31,572
I think it would be
under something bigger.

336
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:36,572
So Chris, I think your man
becoming Minister of War

337
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,836
is the most likely one
there, I think it's you,

338
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,502
- am I right?
- It is!

339
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,497
Yes, two for two!

340
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:46,873
And as was the spirit of the
time, he returned unopposed.

341
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,092
Oh right, okay.

342
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:50,140
Secretary of State for War,
I knew it was a bigger--

343
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,037
- Secretary of State for War.
- Wow, there we go.

344
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,016
Frederick Stanley, with a K.

345
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
- In Stanley?
- In Stanley?

346
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah!

347
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,966
"Oh, an obvious joke,
let's all go for that!"

348
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:00,947
Frederick Stanley.

349
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,091
Frederick Stanlick.

350
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:02,924
Stanlick!

351
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,647
"The K is silent, it's pronounced Stanley."

352
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,952
Congratulations then,
I can't believe I'm saying this

353
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,683
but there's one point to Gary,
there's one point to Chris...

354
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,776
Oh no. We've handed him the win.

355
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:15,024
I've got two points, I've won a thing!

356
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,327
Yay(!)

357
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,420
Wow, thank you for that sarcasm!

358
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,296
From Chris Joel,

359
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,689
Gary Brannan! Matt Gray!

360
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,833
Still don't have an outro.

361
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,883
No, we still don't.

362
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,260
Bye!
