1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
>> Sean: Just to remind people here who, perhaps,
haven't seen our earler videos with you, Brian. 

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,550
So, you worked at Bell Labs and at AT&T.
I mean you did research there. You

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,139
were looking to the future! How right were you?
How wong were you? Can you tell us?
>> BWK:Yeah, so I was

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,630
at AT&T.  I went there for a couple of
summers, starting in the in the late

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,349
1960s and I stayed there, essentially
full-time, until 2000. I was in Bell Labs.

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,529
So at the time AT&T was a very big
company. It was well over a million

7
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,070
people. It was the biggest company in the
country and it provided communication

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,890
services - telephone - for essentially all
of the United States. And Bell Labs was

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,160
the research arm of that. So that's
the part that in theory is looking at the

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,340
future, trying to improve the services
that they have and build the

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,780
technology, in all kinds of ways, that
will make it easy for -- or make it

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,710
possible to improve -- telecommunications
services. And so AT&T did things like

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,739
the transistor and the laser and
miscellaneous other things that were

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,579
useful. And also a lot of computing-related 
things as they gradually

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,890
realized that computers were here to
stay. And that a lot of mechanical things

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,070
like relays, and so on, could be replaced
by electronic devices and then

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,880
controlled by programs, running on
general-purpose computers. In some sense

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,869
the Golden Age for me was probably the
1970s. I had just gotten out of School

19
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,670
and with the early days of computing
there were a lot of really interesting

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,710
work going on and that was when UNIX was
developed, in the  early 1970s, and the C

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,640
programming language and a variety of
other things. And it's also when I played

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,210
with programming languages as well. So
that was definitely a good time. Sort of

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,350
behind your question, I think, is: "Well,
how good were you at seeing the future?"

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,850
And the answer is: "Pretty awful!".  I think
most people are pretty awful at seeing

25
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,560
the future and I'm quite - I could hardly
deny it so I'm perfectly willing to

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,020
admit it - I don't think we had and I
wouldn't say all my colleagues and

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,540
friends at Bell Labs. had much of a clue of
how the world would change. We I guess

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,190
knew about Moore's Law. Moore's Law, I
think came from I think he published

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,020
that paper in 1965 based on a fairly
a short period of data, like maybe five

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,070
years. And I don't think - certainly not I -
but I don't think many people realized

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,810
the implications of an exponential rise
in capability at a fixed price, if

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,590
applied for 40 or 50 years. I don't think we
realized any of that 
>> Sean: So, nobody believed it?

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,330
Nobody took it that seriously for this
period of time?
>> BWK: I don't know whether I would

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,150
say: "Nobody believed it", but I don't think
people realize the implications.

35
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,350
Certainly I did not realize the
implications and we were, I think, often

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,080
surprised when we discovered that
something we had done had actually been

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,850
noticed in the outside world. I remember
at one point Dennis Ritchie saying to me

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,110
something like: "We have arrived!",  because
he had found in the New York Times, which

39
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,440
was still running classified ads for
programmers, they'd wanted a

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,110
programmer who knew UNIX. And this was, I
would guess, in maybe late 70s or

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,870
something like that. And this was us [saying]:
"Boy, what we've done has actually had some

42
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,680
influence in the outside world", in a way
that was completely unpredictable.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,580
>> Sean:  So is there anything you can think
of that you think should have made it but didn't?

44
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,980
I'm kind of putting you on the spot here!
>> BWK: Yeah! that's definitely on the spot.

45
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,050
It's hard to say. One gets the feeling
that a lot of things that were obvious

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,040
to us have been kind of lost in going
forward. One [is] UNIX, the operating system;

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
C the programming language. Many of the
tools. Those all had a flavor of

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,070
minimality, of being small and compact
and good for their particular purpose,.

49
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,110
and not with too many bells and whistles
and very carefully written, and so on. And

50
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,970
as Moore's Law came along and we got
more and more processing power and more

51
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,970
and more memory capacity people sort of
forgot the merits of simplicity, perhaps.

52
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,610
And so things became rather more baroque
or rococo or - pick your architectural

53
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,630
period - and I think that that is in some
ways to everyone's detriment that

54
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,430
systems are very complicated. The other
thing is that at one point there was

55
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,730
really only one - let's call it UNIX -
system and so things were fairly

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,470
compatible. And another
thing that I think we've lost is

57
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,450
compatibility -  that it's harder to get
things to work together perhaps than it

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,240
was. But in some ways perhaps that's
necessary. You think the big change in a

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,930
lot of things has been the rise of
networking: the idea that computers are

60
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,669
not self-contained things any more but,
rather, they are devices that talk to

61
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,240
other devices using a variety of
networking technology - Internet itself.

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,220
And of course increasingly phones. The
phone system. And in fact there's no real

63
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,340
difference between the phone system and
the Internet in some sense, it's kind of

64
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,050
an accidental separation that will
disappear over time. And as different

65
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,190
things talk to each other what
happens there gets more and more

66
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,970
complicated. There are more ways that things
can break. You need standards but the

67
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,060
standards aren't necessarily there. And so,
yeah, I think that's the place where we

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,860
need the most improvement in some sense.
It's ways to make things work better

69
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,419
together and make them simpler and I
guess those are related. 
>> Sean: I think there's

70
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,440
a kind of irony, as well, that
you've got this massive phone company

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,640
effectively pushing forward on computer
technology, and now the many computer

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,750
people use is  the phone in their pocket! 
>> BWK: Yes, right, I think that's again something

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,430
that people didn't predict. There's a
famous story that a consulting company

74
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,200
in the United States, McKinsey, did a
study for AT&T and told AT&T that there

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,240
was basically no market for cell phones;
that people didn't want portable phones.

76
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,130
And this I think is a triumph of how
consultancy can go wrong and yet not

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,289
suffer for it. in any sense. But AT&T
didn't back that stuff as well - a lot of

78
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,350
the early work on mobile telephony was
done at AT&T.

79
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,780
Absolutely. They figured out this the
notion of cells and how you would pass

80
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,440
conversations from one cell to another
something that's completely invisible to

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,169
people today but all of that was in fact
invented originally at AT&T. And then of

82
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:25,900
course evolved tremendously by other
people over the years. And again cell

83
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,950
phones today profit from Moore's law.
That you've got incredible power in a

84
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,279
very, very compact device, would not have
been possible

85
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,009
thirty years earlier.
>> Sean: And the last thing they're used for 
     is phone calls
>> BWK: It's hard to say.

86
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,789
You're hinting that people don't use
their phones to talk and I think that's

87
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,929
true. As far as I can tell
students that I deal with in the United

88
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:52,309
States use their phones primarily for
texting each other and perhaps for

89
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:56,589
checking their Facebook pages - or
whatever the modern equivalent is.

90
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:01,699
And this is so foreign to me that I don't
actually know how to use a phone in many

91
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,809
ways. I had an extended discussion with
Dave [Brailsford], earlier this morning, about how you

92
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:10,369
deal with with phone numbers and whether
you need a 44 and not a zero or is it ... ?

93
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:15,079
Hopeless! And that was the reason I had trouble

94
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:22,959
communicating with him this morning. So
culture shock in some sort of way.
