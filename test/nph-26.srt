00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
MARCO ARMENT:
I feel like one of the areas that independent people like me can have a little advantage over big companies

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,660
is that we can inject more personality into our apps

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,720
and we can not put up some faÃ§ade that looks like we are a big company.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,220
We can do things that big companies can't do. Big companies can't have personality. They just can't.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,580
That's just not how people come together and work by committee.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,740
That doesn't -- Personality does not come out of committees.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,960
BRADY HARAN:
Do you like the idea that people identify your app as, like, one guy, like, homemade, this is Marco's app,

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,400
or do you prefer the idea that people are getting Overcast

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,680
and maybe even think it's made by a big company?

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,160
MARCO ARMENT:
I used to care a lot about that. And you see a lot of independent developers do this,

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,340
where they will do things like they'll say "we." In all the copy that mentions, you know, the author, it'll say,

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,260
"Well, this is what we believe," or "You can contact us,"

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,320
and with Overcast I decided to just drop all that and to just say "I" everywhere

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,500
and to inject some more personality into the app, because for so many years

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,820
computer software has been bland and devoid of personality

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,480
in order to be neutral and all-inclusive and make sure you don't offend or turn off anybody,

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,040
and there's a place for that. In fact, most software should probably keep doing that.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,380
The reaction for Overcast having personality in it has been universally very positive.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
I did not -- Every time I do something, maybe I'll add some little copy in the app,

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,720
like, I recently added a setting to put the icon badge on the icon of how many episodes you have unplayed

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,000
and the description text of this is this "add[s] stress to your life,"

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,060
because I hate that option and everyone who asked me to add it, so I was like

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,960
"OK, fine. I'll add it, but I'll tell you it'll add stress to your life"

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,020
as this kind of tongue-in-cheek remark about why you shouldn't use this setting,

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,360
and that's on a screen called "Nitpicky Details,"

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
which is basically a collection of settings people have badgered me into adding to the app

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,900
that I don't think are necessary.

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,840
Every time I do things like this, I think it's a risk, and I think maybe it'll turn off some people,

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
and every time it's had the opposite effect. Every time, I'll get hundreds of tweets saying,

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,260
"Hey, look at this! This is so great! I'm so happy to see personality,"

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,340
because I think people are kind of starved for some kind of personality in software,

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,500
which is so rarely the actual case.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,760
BRADY HARAN:
Do you worry that if people know an app is made by one person, they might think it's less professional or reliable?

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,180
Does that ever enter your head or is that a silly question?

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,760
MARCO ARMENT:
That is a very valid concern for a lot of kinds of apps. I don't think it's true of a podcast player.

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,180
You know, like, if I was making software for dentists to run their office from.

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,500
-- which, by the way, if you've ever seen dental office software,

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,080
it's... wow. That could use some interface help. --

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,220
but, you know, something like that, you would want a company behind that,

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,880
you would want that to seem official and conservative and, you know, have resources behind it,

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,940
but something like a podcast player made for people who like podcasts on their iPhones,

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't think that really matters that much.

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,660
I also think that, you know, the assumption that a big company's software would be more reliable

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,080
unfortunately has proven itself not to be the case very often recently!

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,780
I think the big companies keep showing us over and over again

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,140
that they actually might be less reliable than what independent people are producing.

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,200
I was not always good at this, and I still often have misses,

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,420
and, you know, not everything I do succeeds.

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,680
What I'm able to do is I make things for myself, and when I step out of that, I don't do very well.

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,340
As long as I just keep making things for myself, those tend to do pretty well,

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,520
and there are enough other people like me -- not a ton, but there are enough --

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,940
that it can support one person's salary pretty well.

53
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,920
BRADY HARAN:
When you do it right...

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,420
MARCO ARMENT:
[CHUCKLES] Right.

55
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,540
BRADY HARAN:
... which I know you don't always, but when you do it right, what do you do right?

56
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,780
MARCO ARMENT:
If I knew, I wouldn't have misses. [CHUCKLES]

57
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,080
BRADY HARAN:
Professionally, what's your problem?

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,960
MARCO ARMENT:
[CHUCKLES] I need to stop blogging. [LAUGHS]

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,800
BRADY HARAN:
What is it about blogging that causes you stress?

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,960
MARCO ARMENT:
I have a really hard time taking the criticism when I --

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,660
it isn't just criticism, a lot of it is just trolling, but some of it is legitimate criticism,

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,900
and I always just feel awful about it, and, I don't know, for whatever reason, I can say whatever I want in a podcast

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,560
and get almost no crap for it from anybody. It's amazing.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,780
If I write anything on my blog, it is put under such a massively higher level of scrutiny

65
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,040
that I just get the worst responses from people.

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,100
And it takes a lot more time to write things for a blog.

67
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,820
I haven't written a lot recently and that's part of the reason why,

68
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,100
that I know I can just get out my ideas in the podcast,

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,220
and not only will I be able to get more out with less effort,

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,640
and then it's also in a conversational format where my friends in the podcast will also, like,

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,980
they'll build on it and they'll disagree with me and we'll have a discussion, so I think it's better for everybody,

72
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,060
and then all of that will also then be greeted by a much better response from people,

73
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,100
where, if you write in a blog, you don't get that, you know,

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,260
if you write it in a blog, it feels more formal and permanent to the reader,

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,720
and so the reader comes and looks at something --

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,180
if I say on a podcast, "Well, I kind of think maybe this might be the case,"

77
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,660
if I write on the blog, "This is the case. Period," then that's a very different environment.

78
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,320
and so people there will attack it: "You didn't think about this!,"

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,240
and the people who are reading the blog, a lot of them are kind of like these drivebys,

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,240
that, these people who don't know me, they haven't been reading my stuff,

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,540
so they don't really have the context of who I am, how I talk, the kind of person I am,

82
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,120
and what I am probably really thinking if I didn't say things exactly right or in the best way,

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,620
whereas in the podcast, you have so much more context of, like, people's humanity.

84
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,200
You have their voice. You hear all their imperfections. You hear them in a discussion with other people.

85
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,020
You kind of feel like it's your friend talking.

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,540
Every time I've started a controversy recently, I regretted starting it.

87
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,600
I don't usually start controversies intentionally.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,660
And people who read my stuff probably, they probably think I'm just BSing about that,

89
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,960
because it seems, afterwards, looking back, it's like

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,420
"Yeah, that was probably going to stir up some controversy,"

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,480
but I don't usually intend for that to happen, and I don't feel good when it does,

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
so I try to avoid that now.

93
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,900
BRADY HARAN:
Our thanks to Audible.com for supporting this video.

94
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,800
I like to listen to audiobooks from Audible when I take the dogs for a walk,

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,800
and with over 180,000 titles in the Audible collection, I don't imagine I'll be running out of options anytime soon.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:45,120
Currently on my reading list and sitting on my phone here is "Pandora's Star" by Peter F. Hamilton.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,600
It's a science fiction book. It was recommended to me by a few listeners via Twitter.

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,380
I'd rather not give away the plot, but I'm enjoying it so far. I think there's a fair chance you'd like it, too.

99
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,740
But no matter what kind of books you're into, Audible is sure to have something you'll like.

100
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,780
They've got a huge collection of spoken word material, you can put it on various devices,

101
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:12,120
and you can try a free one-month trial including your first book, by going to audible.com/computerphile.

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,240
That's audible.com/computerphile so they'll know you came here from the channel.

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,000
Give them a try. Audible are a great way to pass the time on your long commutes, at the gym,

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,520
or, like me, out walking the dogs.

105
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
And our thanks to Audible for making extra videos like this one possible.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,080
MARCO ARMENT:
"... or if I just have a really awesome idea of something else I want to do instead.

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,160
That doesn't happen very often. Most of my ideas are terrible,

108
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,620
and I can recognise that early on that, you know what?

109
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,840
This idea that I thought was really cool, I should not do that."

110
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,180
BRADY HARAN:
"... do you write things on paper, or storyboard a game, or what's it, like, look like at this point?"

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,120
MARC TEN BOSCH:
"Start typing!"
