1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
- What are the ins and outs of unlocking this iPhone?

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,200
Surely, it's just one phone.  There's devil's advocate for you.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,880
- Well, the FBI started off in this case, saying they wanted to unlock just one phone.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,200
That was a phone that belonged to the government, anyway, and was used by a dead terrorist,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,840
and as he was dead, he had no privacy rights.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,620
But once we started to dig into it, it turned out that there had been dozens to hundreds of similar cases

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,460
where the FBI wanted Apple and others to create tools to get at stuff, and they weren't willing.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,080
And, clearly, this was the photogenic case that the FBI thought they could use to batter down the door.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,200
Now, it's an enormous expansion of government surveillance powers

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,560
because, traditionally in America,

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,120
if the police got a warrant, that gave them the right to look,

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,680
but it didn't give them the right to compel the suspect's neighbors or other people to help them.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,040
And, in particular, if you take the rights to order a company

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,620
to provide a weakened version of its software,

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,400
there is a big problem about who else will want that weakened version of the software–

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,940
that golden key–and what they're going to do with it.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,440
- What is this golden key?  How would that work?

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,460
If you've locked something, you've locked it, haven't you?

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,340
- Well, on an iPhone or an Android phone, or any other electronic device,

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,440
the lock that a user can deploy to encrypt his data or her data using a password

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,760
is largely implemented in software on the device,

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,080
and the software can be updated–and it typically is, once a month or so–

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,420
to have patches against whatever security vulnerabilities have been discovered.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
So, if you can somehow subvert or coerce the update process,

25
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,100
you can turn the update into a golden key.

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,140
And this, for law enforcement, must be very thrilling, but for everybody else, it's disastrous,

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,300
because if people start worrying that software updates might give the government or a foreign government

28
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,420
access to their stuff, they'll turn it off.

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,980
And the consequences of that for Internet security could be really, really serious.

30
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,200
- So, I'm thinking of a real-world, non-digital example  of this.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,900
Is this like you've gone and bought a safe with very strong metal walls,

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,220
and then the company who sold you the safe can turn those walls into jelly?

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,200
- Well, yeah, if the company has got a secret 12-digit  engineering access code

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,940
for use by its own technicians only–when they attend

35
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,440
a customer for a bank whose branch manager has died and didn't write down the combination.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,880
And the safe manufacturer's technician can then enter this 12-digit magic code and unlock the bank vault.

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, that's very convenient if you're a safe manufacturer.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,080
But, then, if the FBI says, "We want you to give us this safe magic code because there's one of these

39
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,540
safes in the Chinese embassy," and you do so, right?

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,820
And then that 12-digit code gets out because Mr. Snowden puts it in his latest batch of revelations,

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,740
and then the Chinese and the Mafia all have this magic 12-digit code, then you're absolutely hosed.

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,560
And there's an example of that from Juniper routers.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,660
Juniper make routers–you know, the telephone switches for the Internet.

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,140
And some years ago, it seems the NSA got a backdoor on one of these routers,

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,920
presumably because they got one of their people to get a job at Juniper,

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,680
or they subverted someone who was already there.

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
And, we learned from the Snowden documents that this backdoor existed.

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,080
And what happened, then, was that the Russians and Chinese and others went looking for it and found it.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,960
And, now, Juniper routers,

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,020
half of whose outputs are sold in the USA, are being used by bad guys overseas to attack America

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,320
far more than they are used by the American intelligence agencies to attack targets in China.

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,500
And this is blow-back; this is what happens when you start abusing infrastructure and other trustworthy

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,480
facilities for your own intelligence purposes. It can come back and bite you.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,760
And that's one of the reasons why former senior American intelligence officials–

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,240
Hayden, Roberts and so on are now against encryption backdoors.

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,120
A number of agencies have dreamed about and sometimes implemented NOBUS capabilities–

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,860
And there is a very long history of these "nobody but us" capabilities

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,660
suddenly becoming capabilities that many nations had.

59
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,680
Another example is the atomic bomb.

60
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,180
When the Americans used it in 1945,

61
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,920
they reckoned it might be decades before the Soviets figured out how to build one.

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,880
But, of course, within three years, the Soviets had it, too,

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,580
and we had the nuclear standoff of the Cold War.

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,560
- Here in the UK, though, that's not going to affect us, is it?

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,480
This is an iPhone in America, and it's American laws we're talking about.

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,520
- The FBI case is really, really critical for Britain because of the Investigatory Powers bill

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
that's now going through Parliament.

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,520
Now, the Investigatory Powers bill

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,540
gives the home secretary the power to order communications service providers

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,460
to help law enforcement with warrants.

71
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,400
Now, in the old days, that just meant that British Telecom had to let in the chap from GCHQ

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,640
with his crocodile clips to attach a tape recorder to your phone line.

73
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,280
But nowadays, that most communication is being handled by Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, Twitter,

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,820
and so on, it's very, very different.

75
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:35,320
And the bill has the facility for the home secretary to give a secret technical capability notice

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,080
to a services company saying that they must make available a certain wiretap or surveillance capability.

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Now, because foreign firms objected, they put a clause in the draft bill which says

78
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,680
that there's a defense if it's technically impractical to provide the facility, you don't have to do it.

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,180
And, also, if it's against the law in the company's country of origin, you don't have to do it.

80
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:09,620
But, now, if the FBI succeeded in compelling Apple to provide a golden key for Apple products in the US courts,

81
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,580
and Apple then make that golden key and use it only once,

82
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,540
then Teresa May (UK Home Secretary) can put a secret order on Apple in the UK saying,

83
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,700
"We would really rather like to have one of these golden keys, too please. Kindly deliver it to GCHQ

84
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,680
within the next 30 days or go to jail, and you may not tell anybody that you've given us this golden key."

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,980
And what's going to happen, then, is that the French will do the same.

86
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,740
Do Apple give a key to the French?  Well, perhaps, because the French are a civilized country

87
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,620
and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and so on.

88
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,100
And then the Italians will want one, too.

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,400
And–now hang on a minute, Silvio Berlusconi was in cahoots with the Mafia for many years

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,600
and abused state facilities to do the Mafia's bidding–do you really want to give it to the Italians?

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,660
Well, perhaps, given European structures, you have to.

92
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,380
And, if you give it to the Italians, the Greeks want one.

93
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,480
And then the Egyptians want one.  And then the Saudis want one.

94
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,920
And, pretty soon, just about everybody except the government of North Korea has got a golden key to your iPhone.
