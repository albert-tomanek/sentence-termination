1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're back with Spencer, and we've come to see his amazing collection. What have we got here, Spenc?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,040
It's a whole bunch of Sinclair machines, all from the 1980s, or they're Sinclair-related at the very least.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,300
We'll go from the ZX81 all the way up through to the Spectrum +3 and the Z88.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,160
Clive Sinclair was a British enterpreneur, he had quite a history in the electronics business,

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,160
some of it more successful than others.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,960
But he was quite big in the Hi-Fi side of things and the scientific instruments range of stuff as well,

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,460
but he then went on to make computers.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,220
ZX80 was groundbreaking in its day, when it came out,

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,640
and then the ZX81 went on to be the biggest selling machine of 1981.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,860
Which is where I pick up the story, I don't have a ZX80, unfortunately,

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,660
but if anyone's got one and they want to give it away, I'll happily give you a good home,

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,440
because they are about 400 pound on eBay, and it's a lovely machine,

13
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,600
but it's not worth that to me.

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,130
The variations - I mean, the majority of these are Spectrum-based, but...

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,830
but it does cover a few other odd things along the way as well.

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,440
The Spectrum is one that resonates with a lot of people I grew up with.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,940
Yeah, the Spectrum really was one of the main computers which kicked the computer craze in the 80s.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,800
So most people at school, they all had a Spectrum or a Commodore 64.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,940
Unless their parents were teachers, so they had a BBC Model B, if that was the case.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,940
But yeah, early 80s, they were just everywhere.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,210
Why do you think they permeated society in such a way?

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,940
One of the biggest things about them was the price. They were cheap.

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,860
Yeah, Clive Sinclair really made things down to a price.

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,980
So, yeah, being that much cheaper, it's that much more affordable,

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,600
but underneath that, they are actually really good machines as well.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,240
Really. really quite capable devices for their time.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,460
That's a Spectrum in the background there, isn't it? What's going on at the moment?

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,100
That's Manic Miner that's playing on there.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,640
Obviously that's the best game of all time, yeah, there's no question about that.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,740
It is games like this that I grew up on in the 80s,

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,640
and that's kind of why I'm here today.

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,460
Until things like these, ZX81 and ZX80 came out,

33
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,080
a computer - you either only had little flashing lights and switches on the front to operate it,

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,100
or you had a mainframe-type thing, ridiculously expensive kit.

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,020
This - the computer plugged into your telly, which - most people had a telly back then,

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,400
and the cassette deck - yeah, most people had a tape recorder,

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,180
so really, a cheap, cheap medium for loading and saving the games.

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,240
I've just spotted these microdrive things, what were they?

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,700
Those were Clive Sinclair's alternative to a floppy disk.

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Because back in the day floppy disks were quite expensive, these are little tiny tape cassette cartridges,

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,380
so you've got one continuous spool of tape, which normally takes 100K of data,

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,360
and it loads a lot quicker than what it would do from casette tape.

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,700
So you got more storage, quicker, easier random access to it as well.

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,940
That's the little microdrive cartridge itself, so you see the spool of tape in there.

45
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,960
There's two tracks on there, which are about 50K each,

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,300
or supposed to be there - in practice it never turned out to be quite as good as that,

47
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,320
so you might get about 80 or 90K of data on there, if you're lucky.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,960
Do you use them at all, or is that...?

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,220
I used to use them back in the 80s, I've got them now just for...  yeah, for completeness, effectively.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,600
But yeah, they aren't a practical, safe way of storing data these days.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,820
And presumably, there are not many of the cartridges around.

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,440
No, they stopped being made years ago.

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,700
We've talked a little bit about RAM pack wobble before.

54
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,540
And, you know, there were certain reliability issues sometimes, weren't there?

55
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,089
Do you think that was widespread, or did he just get tainted by a few bad examples?

56
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:37,169
There is definitely a history of him... to cut corners wherever possible, yeah.

57
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:42,480
So you save a couple of pence here and there, so there were some problems.

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,740
One of the other big issues is the fact that he would preannounce products,

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
and take preorders, and it'll be delivered next month.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
That actually turns out to be two months, three months, four months down the line.

61
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,660
Some of the very early models to go out just weren't finished,

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,300
they had lots of bodged wires in them and stuff like that.

63
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,100
So, yeah, that didn't help his reputation much.

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,020
I've heard they used to use the delivery times as basically the finance for the devices.

65
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,100
Do you know about that?

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,960
The money wasn't exactly in the bank accounts to start with,

67
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,200
so if you can pre-sell the stuff that gets you the money in,

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,720
then you can start to make it and hopefully it's gonna work before you ship it out.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,900
When the QL was announced, I mean, that took quite a few months before that was available,

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,980
but the first ones of those, they actually had the ROMs hanging out the back,

71
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,900
on the little plug-in extra circuit board, because they weren't finished, so they had to ship something.

72
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,600
And it's "well, that kind of normally sometimes works, so ship'em out, 'cause we got customers that need them."

73
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,080
The original Spectrum was a huge big hit,

74
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,420
obviously there was pressure on him to come up with something bigger and better.

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,600
And he wanted to get into the business world a bit more.

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,140
So, the QL was launched in 1984, and that came out with a proper keyboard.

77
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,960
And the actual keys. Yeah, it's just like a keyboard.

78
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,400
That was obviously an improvement on the "dead flesh" keyboard of the Spectrum

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
What did you call it, dead...?

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
I don't know if you've felt dead flesh lately, but it's just like that.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,540
The Spectrum was revamped at the end of '84 with the Spectrum+,

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,440
which is effectively exactly the same computer as the original Spectrum, it's the same motherboard.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,860
Only difference being, you got a real keyboard and a reset button.

84
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,190
Other than that, Spectrum+ and the Spectrum 48k are the same beast.

85
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,420
So now you could turn it off and on again with a button?

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,240
That's right, yes, because the power socket was always a little bit fragile,

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,440
and if you've done it too quickly, you could damage it.

88
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,900
So, yeah, having a reset button probably saved a lot of machines there.

89
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,100
That was kind of a normal operation, of loading a program, wasn't it? You did have to turn it off.

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,820
Once you've finished playing the game, you wanted to play something else, that's kind of what you did.

91
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes, yes, and there's no shutdown procedure or anything like that.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,260
There's no startup procedure either.

93
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,780
It's just a case of "here, there's power - it works, there's no power - doesn't work."

94
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,360
That's as simple as it got.

95
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,820
And no multitasking, of course.

96
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh, no.

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,540
It was a lot more flexible, there's also a decent sound chip in there as well,

98
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,240
as opposed to the beep-beep-beep that we got out of the old Spectrum.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,980
A whole number of sectors, or technically we use clusters,

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,800
which is multiple sectors joined together, to store...
