1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
In the old days cards from the
1960's had a magnetic strip right so that when

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,809
you did a transaction the terminal would
read the data on the card's magnetic strip

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,869
but from 2003 in the UK you started to
get chips as well. So the information is

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:22,090
kept in this semiconductor chip and that
makes it significantly more difficult to counterfeit.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,369
. To counterfeit a mag stripe card all you gotta do is copy it onto a new card

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,359
but to counterfeit a chip you've
got a drill into it with lasers and probing stations

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,620
and other expensive fiddly
equipment and get the keys out, and that

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,070
is a pain and it only works some of the
time and you just don't want to go there.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,770
But don't worry if you're a criminal
'cause there are lots and lots of easier ways of

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,650
cheating chip and pin systems.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,940
Chip & PIN is fun. It was designed in the late

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,719
nineteen nineties on the basis of some
earlier experiments in the earlier

13
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,070
nineteen nineties in which we were
privileged to have some small role and

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,600
it was introduced first in Britain from
2003 to 2005 so we started off with an

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,330
idea of what the frauds would likely be. For example if you have got some means of

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,250
intercepting the transaction flow between a card and a terminal. Say you've got a false card

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,600
and you can wire it up to a false terminal elsewhere then when a sucker

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,750
puts his card into your terminal you
can teleport that to a dodgy card that

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,860
you then present at a jewelers shop - and we demonstrated this as a proof of concept

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:39,869
and these relay attacks work in theory
but you don't see them in practice then

21
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,430
once Chip and PIN got fielded we began
to see how things change in the real

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,290
world and fraud didn't in fact go down but it went up because first of all the bad guys

23
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,700
went online and although fraud
initially fell a little bit in shops, it

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,579
more than caught up for that by increasing online. Second although fraud from

25
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,840
counterfeit cards initially went down,
when they introduced chip and PIN

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,140
what happened was that after a period of
six months or so it shot up and what the

27
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,400
bad guys had realized is that now you've
got these chip and PIN devices

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,120
everywhere you could use them to harvest
chip and PIN details, card details and

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,090
you could then make up mag stripe card
forgeries and use them in ATMs that would

30
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,379
still accept mag stripe transactions.
So we found for example that there was a

31
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,410
dodgy chip and PIN terminal in the BP
garage (gas/petrol station) in Girton (Cambs) which caused a couple

32
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,209
of hundred people locally to have money
taken from their cash machines in

33
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,819
Thailand of all places and there was a
gang that got various people that

34
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,290
garages around the country to install
dodgy equipment that would capture

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,310
people's chip and PIN details so that
was one of the things that went wrong. It

36
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,390
was possible for example to remove part
of the back of a chip and pin terminal

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,410
and put electronics in there and drill in so
that you got into the serial link which

38
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,739
goes between the PIN-pad and the card and that gets the current details going one

39
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,069
direction and the PIN going in the other
direction and that's all that you need

40
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:11,720
to do mag stripe forgeries. After we
demonstrated this on TV the banks said

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,290
"Well you know that's a difficult attack
Cambridge students could do it but real

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,630
criminals couldn't" but only a few months
later they arrested a couple of guys in

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,359
Manchester what they've done was get
access to the warehouse in Dubai

44
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,450
where the chip and pin terminals stopped to catch breath on route from the factory in

45
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,030
China to the retail trade in Britain
and the Netherlands and in the back of

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,840
them they put little mobile phones so
that whenever you used this terminal it

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,380
would text your card and PIN details to
somebody in Karachi - and those guys

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,389
eventually got off because the banks
weren't prepared to offer evidence

49
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,340
against them it was just too
embarrassing more recently what we

50
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,400
discovered is that we got a number of
people came to us and they said look my

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,840
card was stolen it was then used in a
shop - the bank says it must be my fault

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,400
because the PIN was used and so I must
have been negligent but it couldn't

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,870
have happened I didn't use the card with the PIN. We went and we looked and we found that

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:13,060
it's actually easy to cheat because what
you can do, is you can put a device

55
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,790
between the card and the terminal

56
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,680
which tells the terminal that the pin was
accepted by the card but tells the card

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,490
that it was a chip and signature
transaction and this is an example of

58
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,880
the electronics that you can use you put
the stolen card into the device like

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,639
this and you then use the 'tame' card in
the chip and PIN device like this and

60
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,160
this means that the electronics can
modify the transaction as it flows from

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,530
your stolen smart card to the chip
and PIN terminal. The chip and PIN machine

62
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,570
is told that you entered the correct PIN
even although you didn't but the card

63
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,380
is told that a signature verified the
transaction and it's this kind of

64
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,440
sleight-of-hand this enables no-PIN fraud to be carried out and we've seen

65
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,690
that in the wild since, gosh, about 2010 2011

66
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,860
there're people in France who've been sent to jail for it

67
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,090
there're number of variants of it and now we're starting to see it in China because in

68
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,919
China you can buy tiny little two-sided
SIM cards that will go between your

69
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,330
phone and your SIM card to enable you
to do roaming more cheaply right, so that you

70
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,150
can roam among China's different
provinces and the problem with these

71
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,350
slim shims is that they're just what you
need to replace all this electronics

72
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,010
[Sorry, slim SIM is it?] or a SIM shim

73
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,940
['Shim' is it? Oh so it's like, shimmies inbetween] ...exactly so and so these devices
can enable you to replace all this

74
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,169
electronics with one tiny little chip that you can just slip in between the stolen card

75
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,370
and the chip & PIN terminal. What we're
doing is getting a man in the middle as

76
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,560
we call it in between the card and the
chip and PIN machine so we can

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,289
manipulate those parts of the
transaction that aren't properly

78
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,919
cryptographically authenticated. So
that's the latest fraud technology.

79
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:11,260
The latest fraud methodology is simpler
because what you do is you take a chip

80
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,150
and PIN machine and you re-program it and we're now seeing 'evil' chip and pin machines

81
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,169
coming on the market in Europe in Spain, in Britain, in Portugal and in the Baltics

82
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,400
and elsewhere

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,520
and what these chip and PIN machines will do - is they'll display a small amount on the

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,930
screen, say your transaction is thirty
pounds for a meal or whatever

85
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,759
while putting a big transaction into the card - 3,000 pounds OK - and these are typically

86
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,199
used in places like night clubs and
strip clubs and so on. So there's various guys from

87
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,300
Britain have gone on stag nights in
Poland or in Lithuania or whatever and

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,150
they come back and find those a five
thousand-pound transaction on the chip

89
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,370
and PIN card. How did it happen? Well you used your chip and PIN card in a strip club

90
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,160
in Vilnius what do you expect? Or in
Barcelona, or now even in Bournemouth

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,410
this is now happening in Britain as well
and it's very very difficult for people

92
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,620
who go into a bad place and use a card
because if, if you complain to your bank

93
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,510
then the strip club owner will just say "He was with four girls all night and four...

94
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,099
...thousand pounds is what that costs at our place!" So you really are on a hiding to

95
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,370
nothing when it comes to complaining. The thing about this is that the

96
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,300
average person just doesn't think that,
you know, if you pull your wallet out

97
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,349
of your pocket you've got what, two or three cards in there? If each of these cards

98
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:37,110
is good for five or ten thousand pounds,
you know, with your overdraft limit and the

99
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,199
extra undocumented overdraft that the bank will give you and charge you extra for...

100
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,659
There's a total spending power in your pocket of maybe twenty thousand pounds.

101
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,990
Now, you wouldn't dream of walking into a whore-house on a Saturday night with 20,000

102
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,810
pounds in cash in your pocket would you? But that's what people do when they walk

103
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,740
into dodgy businesses just carrying a
normal wallet with normal chip and PIN

104
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,630
cards in them and that's a new hazard
that people just aren't aware of yet

105
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,220
There's a classic example of the middle person attack which is John Conway's famous idea of how

106
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,470
to beat a Grandmaster at chess. Well it's easy just play two grand masters at chess

107
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,670
simultaneously by postal chess and you
relay the moves backwards and forwards from one to the other

108
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,520
playing games like this is what security
engineers are really really into when

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,450
it comes to designing protocols and
protocols are hard to design right

110
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,310
people usually get them wrong and again
and again we find protocol flaws with

111
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,410
EMV which can be exploited and are being exploited. EMV is the Sunday

112
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,390
afternoon name for chip & PIN it's Europay / Mastercard / Visa protocol
