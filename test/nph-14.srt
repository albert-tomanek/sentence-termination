1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,620
The era is the early 1990s.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:10,380
I was aware of SGML - aware of, if you like, the very 
technical usage of it in things like the Text Encoding Initiative.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,960
I'd heard about Tim Berners-Lee's usage of SGML 
technology for Web page markup,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,340
in the unfortunately named 'HTML'.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,800
So much better if he'd called it just 'Hypertext 
Markup', HTM,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,180
or even, as somebody said, 'Tim's Own Tagset', 
TOT - how about that!

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,980
But not 'ML' at the end!

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:37,340
You have to remember that at exactly the same time,
almost, in the early '90s, PDF came about.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,280
And I was doing a lot of work with Adobe.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,100
So there was this 'European Hypertext' meeting in
September 1994,

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,980
sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, 
which is basically our professional body in the States.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,620
and I thought: "Wwell, it's all going to be about SGML, 
HTML, and all this kind of thing,

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:06,680
but just to say that there are other notations for documents, 
and other things where you can embed hyperlinks, even,

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,900
I want to talk about PDF!"

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:17,160
because my group here was, I think, the UK's first ever beta 
test site for PDF. We've got a lot of experience.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,780
And I thought: "Just as balance, I'll put in a paper about 
the use of PDF", and it was accepted,

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,000
So, I think the organisers realised you needed a bit of 
a balancing discussion.

18
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,480
I gave my talk and it went down very well,

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,860
although I think some of the more 'who cares about 
appearance?' brigade were...

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,440
"PDF, it's so messy! It looks beautiful, but inside 
it's a mess! It needs more structure!"

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,540
They just wanted the markup.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:52,220
The fact that whether you want to do it in Times Roman 
or Palatino or Optima, "That's for graphics artists to worry about.

23
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,280
All we're concerned is... y'know ... it's a Heading."

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,360
So at the end of my talk, I had a lot of very interesting 
questions - because PDF was pretty new technology.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,640
But marching up the aisle towards me - and I did recognise 
him from photographs,

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,600
It's the only time we've ever met - was Tim Berners-Lee, 
now Sir Tim.

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,360
He came up, shook my hand, said "I really enjoyed that."

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,940
He said, "You know, it won't go down well with everybody here,

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:26,700
but I think we're in for a document universe where we've got 
to try and make detailed, tight appearance, co-exist with structure,

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,400
and it's going to be a struggle."

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,140
How right he was! We're still struggling with those 
20, 30 years later.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,920
So he said, "You know all this flak I've been getting about 
calling it HTML,

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,880
and why couldn't I've done my homework more thoroughly 
before I defined it?

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,560
We're having a panel session, we're going to try and 
get all these issues sorted out,

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,460
Would you like to come along?"
So I said "Yeah, sure, fine."

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,380
So I went into this big hall and there were parallel 
panel sessions, but this was by far and away the most popular.

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,860
Believe me, viewers, I was there.

38
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,780
It was wonderful!

39
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,580
At the front were...

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,000
people... two rival armies almost!

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,780
Standing up at the front, making their pitch.

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,980
And I classified them straight away

43
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,300
as either being "theologians" or "browser pragmatists".

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,940
And you've got to remember that this was two years 
after Tim first did the HTML thing.

45
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,640
And companies like Netscape, who were the leaders 
at the time,

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,040
and, getting in on the act, Internet Explorer from 
Microsoft,

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,860
saw immediately the potential of this standardised 
markup, which they hoped really was standardised --

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
or maybe they didn't hope,

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,980
because it became very clear that Netscape and IE 
[Internet Explorer] having got hold of this,

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,020
would love to be in a market-dominant position.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,100
You know, extra tags were needed inside this HTML

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,060
It's good for a start, but there's all sorts of 
things you could do with it.

53
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,840
Let's add a few more tags!

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,600
And it goes without saying

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,800
that the Netscape additions were totally different 
to the Internet Explorer additions,

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,720
and this whole thing that we covered in the last 
video about the underlying technology of SGML

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,260
allowing you to omit tags so long as you thought 
it was safe to do so - well, guess what?

58
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,200
Netscape and Internet Explorer had different 
omitability specifications.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,900
And one way or another, it meant that a thing 
that worked beautifully in Netscape

60
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,660
was going to fall over - all over the place! -
in Internet Explorer.

61
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,620
What was to be done about this?
There was no standards body at the time.

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,700
So... they were doing their own thing, 
but in the meantime,

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,020
the opposing army was a bunch of people 
who'd been with SGML ever since day one, 
and loved it dearly,

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,360
and were very fond of carrying around this book,

65
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,940
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
as if it was a sort of... some kind of precious 
holy book.

66
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,460
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
This had the full spec.

67
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,260
['SGML Handbook' - Charles F. Goldfarb]
Things really started going downhill

68
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,360
when one of the theologians held this up, pointed 
at the chap from Netscape and said,

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,520
"If only you'd read this carefully from cover to 
cover before you wrote a SINGLE line of code,

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,080
we'd be in a lot better state than we are now!"

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,700
Oh boy, yes!
And of course, there was the immediate response,

72
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,760
saying "Some of us, buddy, don't have ten years 
to take in all of this stuff!"

73
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,620
And then it got even worse, because they said,

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,960
"The difficulty that you people are in, IE 
and Netscape with all this,

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,960
you know, it took Tim a while for us to convince him,

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,380
you must give a spec of when tags are omissible,
you must give the spec of what's a legal tag"

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,800
We call this a DTD - a Document Type Definition.

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,720
"Such a shame that people never thought to write 
one of these properly before they started to code!"

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,040
And so the guy said, "Look, are you seriously saying

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,800
that it's not just checking whether this markup 
inside the Web page forms a tree and a sequence,

81
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,920
You want us to be looking, all the time, at the 
tagset spec to see what's omissible, and what isn't?"

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,640
"Yes, of course!" said the theologians -
you know, in unison - "Of course!

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,720
You keep the DTD with you while you are parsing."
The man from Netscape did a John McEnroe!

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,760
VOICEOVER (McENROE): "You can't be serious, man.
You CANNOT be serious!"

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,360
>> DFB: "You cannot be serious! You want me to be looking 
over my shoulder ALL THE TIME at the language spec while 
I'm just trying to display something?"

86
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,440
"Oh by the way..." said Lead Theologian,
"something else we ought to mention.

87
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,240
"When you get a partly correct Web page, but with mistakes...

88
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,520
...you're displaying part of it to people!
Don't do that!"

89
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Total disbelief from the other camp,
jaws dropping - "What do you want us to do?"

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,660
"Easy! Behave like a compiler. Issue an 
error report.

91
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,180
Say, 'Error in Web page: </p> tag omitted 
when this is not allowed'

92
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,840
or something like this. Just like a compiler, 
you know."

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,220
"Above all," said the high priest, "you display nothing!

94
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,340
Because if you display something, when it's 
incorrect, it leads to bad habits."

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,980
[laughing] And I think as you've said to me many a time, 
Sean, what kind of real world were these people living in?

96
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,260
Because, of course, with this being an interpreted 
system, everybody's very excited about Web pages,

97
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,340
You are going to go for the browser manufacturer 
who tolerates your inadequacies,

98
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,900
Because we're talking about hand-coded Web pages now.

99
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,560
If it tolerates you and gives you some idea of 
what's happening

100
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,900
and you can sort of see where I must've gone wrong, fine!

101
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,840
But to sort of end up with a great long list of 
compiler error messages

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
saying "Your page is deficient. Try again. Recompile",
and so on,

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,340
it's obviously not gonna go down well.

104
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,900
>> SEAN: I can imagine if Safari, Firefox or Chrome 
just didn't display anything

105
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,860
because there was a mistake on it,
I'm not gonna use that browser.

106
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,300
>> DFB: No! Exactly so!

107
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,180
And I mean the other thing that the high priests 
were getting really upset about

108
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,940
was - we all know that inside a well-constructed 
Web page -

109
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,560
You open a <p>, and you close a </p>
[with a forward stroke] for a paragraph.

110
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,980
But inside that, you say,
"Oh I want all of this to be in bold."

111
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,160
So you open up a bold tag, and you should 
close the bold tag.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,960
But what happens if you do it in the wrong order?

113
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,160
You open a <p>, you open a <b>,

114
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,800
<p> <b> </b> </p>
but then instead of closing </b> and closing </p>,

115
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
<p> <b> </p> </b>
 
...you do that.

116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,220
<p> <b> </p> </b>
 
That's called an overlapping hierarchy -

117
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,540
You turn off 'paragraph' before you turn off 'bold',
it should be the other way around.

118
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:50,460
Again, absolute fury from the theologians -
"You are allowing overlapping hierarchies! 
Just ignoring..."

119
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,860
...and all this kind of stuff(!)
I mean... oh, it was wonderful!

120
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,600
And to my great dismay, I actually had to leave 
the meeting early.

121
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,500
Believe it or not, later that day, I was flying down 
from Edinburgh to Birmingham

122
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,280
because I was down, somewhere, to give a talk about PDF.

123
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,860
It was essentially a very similar one to the one 
I'd given in Edinburgh.

124
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,020
So I went away and just thought, "This is incredible",
but realising this was a watershed.

125
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,820
It was really THE meeting to be at and when you 
looked at the title of it, y'know  -

126
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,700
'Is it Poison or Panacea', HTML?

127
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Panacea, of course, is a Greek word, I think,
for a cure-all, isn't it?

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,680
>> SEAN: Yeah, that's it, yeah.
>> DFB: Yeah 'cure for all ills', I think, 
is what it means,

129
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,760
And it was a very good choice of title, and it 
was THE most significant confrontation I've think 
I've ever been to in my life.

130
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,720
And I think Tim sent me an email afterwards, or 
maybe somebody told me about this, but anyway,

131
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,540
I got a message but I had to go to Birmingham, cursing 
having to get the plane.

132
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,160
And I sort of said, "What happened?"

133
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,820
He said: "Easy!" [inhales] "Told them all they were all 
correct, and took them off to the pub,

134
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,280
and bought lots of pints of beer.

135
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,080
We had a very good meeting that went on into the evening."

136
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,740
And what Tim asked was for Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems

137
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,560
and Tim Bray, a very respected SGML user and guru,

138
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:17,500
to please lead a committee of experts -
first of all, actually for HTML itself -

139
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,780
"Please will you write me a DTD?
I know I should've done one,

140
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,440
but is it possible to write a DTD that makes 
it SGML compliant?

141
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,380
But then, can you tackle the problem of saying 
SGML is problematical because it allows omitted end tags?"

142
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,660
plus all sorts of other things, minor things.

143
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:47,180
Can you within 18 months, no more, do a very quick report 
on how to do a subset of full SGML

144
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,340
that's cleaner, which insists on end-tags being there,

145
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:02,120
which doesn't allow - as SGML does - for the fact that <PARA> 
in capitals as being treated the same as <para> in lower-case,

146
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,980
This is a hangover from punch card days, you see, 
where everything tended to end up in upper case anyway,

147
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,800
and all sorts of horrendous things - you could put pointy 
bracket comments in the middle of a tag declaration?"

148
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,920
Various other more specialised nightmares which I'll 
put out for you in accompanying notes to go with this video.

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,480
And basically, it was agreed - "We've got to get this 
out quickly" - what came to be known as XML.

150
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:39,360
And they were as good as their word. I think it was 
1996 when the first XML draft spec was delivered.

151
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:47,400
They came up with two things: XML - which is a subset, 
the clean, abstract subset -

152
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:55,220
But the second thing they did while they were at it was 
to say "Right, we've done you a DTD for the SGML version of HTML,

153
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,840
"We wrote you the DTD, Tim, that you should've years ago,

154
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,260
"But just notice how much cleaner and nicer the tag set 
spec is when we do it with XML

155
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,580
and we don't let omitted end tags happen, ever!"
And everybody was convinced,

156
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,640
and said, "Oh, who cares about extra disk space? 
It doesn't cost anything these days."

157
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,480
>> SEAN: These kind of conferences and panel discussions 
and confrontation,

158
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Do they accomplish as much as a night in the pub?

159
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,080
>> DFB: [laughs] I think you needed both.

160
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,140
You needed the full and frank exchange of opinions,

161
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,780
but then you needed a calming-down period with lots 
of beer in the pub,

162
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,480
And I think the assertion that actually there was 
right on both sides is absolutely correct,

163
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,660
A lot of good lessons were learned from that, yeah.

164
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,720
I think it was Tim and others, but they chose well in 
asking Jon Bosak of Sun, and Tim Bray,

165
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,640
some very respected authorities to actually try and 
get the basic tagset technology sorted,

166
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,160
the XML to be a proper subset of SGML,

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:15,480
And in one of the requirements spec it says,
"Brevity is to be of minimal importance."

168
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,000
In other words: "Don't go bananas about missing out 
all your end tags because it halves the size of your files.

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,620
We don't care any more. If they're tough to parse, fine."

170
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,900
And the thing they ended up with in XML was what the browser 
people wanted all along.

171
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,960
To say, "I don't need to know the full tag set spec in 
the first instance,

172
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,580
I just want to check if what you've given me - that  all 
the tags match and it's a tree?

173
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,800
I don't care what it says in the tags, but do they match 
up correctly to form a tree structure?

174
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,600
I don't need to have the DTD to tell if it's a tree 
structure, whereas with SGML you did."

175
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,000
So there we are. The power of several pints of beer, 
isn't it wonderful?
