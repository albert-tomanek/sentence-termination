1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
This is the Technical Difficulties,
and this is an experiment.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,400
For the very first time,
I do not have a laptop in front of me.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,680
I do not have any of the facts;
one of these three do.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,960
Introducing Chris Joel.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,520
I just like the idea that this
is literally the first time

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,320
since you turned about 14 that
you don't have a laptop in front of you.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,440
That's pretty accurate.
Gary Brannan.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,560
I adore distilled whippet s***.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,760
And...
What's that a quote from?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,800
Tom Baker.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,880
Matt Gray.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,680
The thing is, I can never say anything here
because I have to follow that up.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,600
When you say 'that',
do you mean Gary or Gary's line?

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,680
-Gary.
-Okay.

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,120
Don't refer to me as "that"!

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,880
-The object over here.
-Fine, Gary's content!

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,360
****er put me in the nominative.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,760
T-shirt.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
Do him up the nominative!

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,960
Accusative!

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
Here's what's going to happen.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,200
Actually, Matt,
why don't you tell them what's going to happen?

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,080
So he was sat around the corner with some
headphones on and each of the three of us

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,720
found a Wikipedia article
and we didn't show it to one another.

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
Tom is now going to pick up one of the titles
of the Wikipedia articles,

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,440
which we've put on the pieces of paper
down there

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,560
and we're all going to act
like we know what we're on about

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,040
and Tom has to guess which one of us
is talking s***

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
and which ones of us is telling the truth.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
Alright, are we ready?

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
Going for this one.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,760
Kebakko.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
Now, can I say, called it:

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,000
because I said you would open it like that
and then do that.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,280
A number of times to make sure
that he was perfectly encapsulating.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Chris.

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,040
Chris, I'm going to start with you,
what's kebakko?

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,920
Kebakko is a Polish sausage company,

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
kielbasa company, formed mid-70s

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,320
but died out in the early 80s
due to declining profits.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,440
I mean that is entirely plausible,

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Gary, what…

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,840
That's the idea of the game, Tom.

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
I know, but you know what's also important,

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,560
me commenting on what I think of your statement.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,280
Conversation is how this show works.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,920
Sorry, I'm not used to you
having an active role.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
Neither am I.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
I love the idea of a show where you just sit there
and go 'hmm, yeah' to every statement.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
-And now the...
-Brannan, what is kebakko?

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
Kebakko is a type of Finnish convenience food,
it's a bit like a meatball,

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,200
-it's a bit like a kebab.
-Hmm.

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,920
A meatball on a stick.

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,240
-Correct.
-If that was true, that would be great.

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
It sounds awesome.

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,520
I really need, like, notebooks here
for me to write this down.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
"Who said what to whom?"

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,360
You're not having a laptop!

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,560
Mr Gray, what is kebakko?

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,080
It's funny that you introduced me as Mr Gray
for that, it's actually a family name.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,480
-Oh!
-Yeah, Marcel Kebakko was the, you know,

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,960
more famous of them
and they were touring circus artists.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,240
You're all significantly better at bluffing
and improvising than I am,

64
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,440
I definitely need …
can we just … can I get a pen?

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,320
I actually need a pen and paper for this
so I can make notes.

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,280
Pause.

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
There.

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,960
Those are hands, Gary, not paws.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,800
-Gary.
-Yes.

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
The Finnish snack food.
I have been to Finland,

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,760
I have been to convenience stores,

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,560
I do not believe that kebakko
is a thing I can buy there.

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Well, you're a ****.

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Sorry, what do you want me to say back to that?

75
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,400
It is!

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,200
What, so you've been to a multitude of snack…

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
of snack... dispensaries
and not seen this particular food?

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
He's checked every major brand
the length of the country.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,520
Tom Scott only believes
what he has actually encountered.

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's face it, if there was a product
that was balls on a stick,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Tom would know.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
-Oh! Wow!
-You're right.

83
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,960
Wait. "Meatball dispensary."
We just glossed over a meatball dispensary.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,440
Ball, ball, ball.

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,320
Is it like a gum ball machine,
you put your five cents and you get a meatball?

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
I see you have both been to Finland.

87
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,200
Full of marinara sauce,
it comes out pre-glazed.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
You have your point,
it comes with a sauce,

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
it comes with…
it comes with a sauce.

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,640
I like how you said that
as you're reaching down.

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
It comes.

92
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,200
It comes with a sauce(!)

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,320
-Dipping sauces.
-Get your balls on a stick.

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,080
-Balls on a stick.
-They come with a sauce.

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Balls on a stick covered in a spicy sauce,
do you have a problem with this?

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
I've got to be honest,
meatballs on a stick is an entirely plausible

97
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,440
Finnish food to have.

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,840
Yeah.

99
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,320
I just worry that what you've actually done
is taken meatballs from IKEA in Sweden

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,600
and desperately tried to backsolve
through kebab, so I think Gary,

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
-I'm going to rule yours out.
-F***!

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
It's down between...

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Wow! "I am sorry, your arguing skills
are that bad, you're just... no."

104
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,120
Well, the case for the prosecution rests on the
fact that he never saw one

105
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,720
when he was
in Finland that time, there we go.

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Matt, tell me more about
the travelling circus artist,

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
what sort of circus acts did they do?

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
They were actually notable
for the fact that they …

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
it was all, like, human pursuits,
I can't think of the phrase they used for that

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
in the article,
but, so it was all like trapezey

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,360
or swingy or, you know,
rather than animals doing things.

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,440
Which for the time

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,320
-which I think was 1850 something.
-Was it gymnastics, I guess?

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Yeah, it didn’t use that word, it used
something…

115
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
There'll be a circus word.

116
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah, there was a circus word for it,
and they started off in,

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,880
I think it was near Lille,
and then made their way around Europe.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,400
-And eventually got married to a Judith which…
-Judith!

119
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
-if you heard me giggling while you were
in the kitchen,

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
Marcel and... Judith Kebakko.

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,200
I was about to go no,
it's definitely Chris,

122
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,040
but that tiny little detail about Judith
is either the best bit of plausible rubbish

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,960
you've ever had or just a wonderful name.
-Is that a compliment?

124
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Judith is a very plausible name.

125
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,480
-Yeah.
-I believe in people called Judith.

126
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Judith the gymnast.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
If I was to come up with a couple's name
off the top of my head...

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,400
It wouldn't be Marcel and Judith,
this is what gets me.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Marcel and Judith.

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,480
That's a genuinely difficult decision
between the two of you. Gary...

131
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,320
It's just discounted.
...you are half price.

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,120
-Doesn’t exist?
-No, I don't believe that.

133
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,640
Matt, I believe you. Am I right?

134
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,720
Yeah, you're right if you're saying
that I'm talking s***.

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,640
Oh!

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,880
I absolutely was sat here
for the last five minutes

137
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
trying to think of a wife's name
other than Judith.

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
You went with Judith!

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,360
And weirdly that was the most convincing
part of the entire bloody story.

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,260
That's what convinced me!
That was the last bit!

141
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,280
I was sat there thinking,

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,160
his wife wouldn't be called Judith!
No, I'm just going to have to sell it,

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
it's Judith.

144
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Why did Judith get stuck there?

145
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,360
I was trying to think of a French sounding
or a German sounding female name.

146
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Well, that's simple, Judith.

147
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,560
So just to be clear,
everything Matt said was a lie,

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
none of that is factual?

149
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
-Yeah, correct, yeah.
-Chris.

150
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
Also bulls***.

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,680
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

152
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
F*** you.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
F*** you.

154
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,080
F*** you. F*** you,
right in the ******* ***, there it is.

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,040
That was the least plausible!
Meatballs on a stick,

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
why would you put a meatball on a stick?

157
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,360
So you can hold it while you eat it,
it's a kebab.

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,800
Right, can I read it?
"It consists of meat, breadcrumbs, onions,

159
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
"eggs and spices,
the difference is mostly in shape

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,840
"instead of a ball,
kebakko can also be a piece of meat

161
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,560
"on a wooden stick and usually sold
in packs of 4 to 12.

162
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
"The name comes from the Turkish food,
kebab."

163
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,160
Wow!

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
I just… I envisioned this, like, long stick,

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,760
like you're roasting marshmallows or something
with a meatball on the end,

166
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,080
which does not seem like a good way
to eat a meatball.

167
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,760
"The usual way to eat them is to heat them
and serve them with various sauces for dipping,

168
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,320
-"the stick enables the kebakkos to be dipped
and eaten by hand."

169
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,080
So it's like a tiny little toothpick stick,
right, okay.

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,200
No, I think there's a little stick
and you just dip it in the sauce like a kebab.

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,040
Well, put it this way,
you know when you get a kebab, Tom?

172
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,800
-Yeah.
-The gesture you were doing before...

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
-Yeah.
-Not a good way.

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,920
Do you eat a f***ing kebab like that
or do you have it sideways on?

175
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
-The man's a genius.
-I just thought it was like…

176
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,200
I was seeing like small meatballs on sticks,
like cocktail things.

177
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Right.

178
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
Point to Gary.

179
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
A point, no, a point to Matt.

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,480
-A point to Matt.
-A point to Matt for convincing me,

181
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,440
congratulations, Judith.

182
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Does that mean I win the show?

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,160
Depends, how long has the show been going
on for? We haven't worked this out yet.

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
We have taken a moment,

185
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Gary has gone and got himself a new article
to replace kebakko.

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,360
There are three new ones in there,
so I do not know.

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
Please let mine come out again.

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah, it could be Gary's a second time,
let's pick it from down here and it is…

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Folded.

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Lentokenttä. Lentokenttä,
and we will start with Matt on this one,

191
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Matt, what is Lentokenttä?

192
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Amusingly, considering the previous one,

193
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,120
this is a region of Finland.

194
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,400
Region of Finland, yeah,
do you want to tell me any more about it?

195
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,640
Nah, you can ask later.

196
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
All right. Gary.

197
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Amusingly, considering the previous entry,

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,600
this is a region of Russia,
now on the Finnish border,

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,280
in fact it's the music that comes
from that region,

200
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,840
traditionally played on the nose flute.

201
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm almost tempted to just immediately strike
that because it was nearly there

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,000
until the words 'nose flute'.

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
And how well did these theories work last time?

204
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,360
-This is why I haven't struck it yet.
-I thought you were going to go the other way,

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,680
I thought you just weren't even going
to ask me and it's like, "it's the nose flute",

206
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,800
"F*** it, it's clearly the nose flute."

207
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,840
-Nose flute music.
-Yeah.

208
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,440
From a region of Russia
near the Finnish border?

209
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,960
-Correct.
-Chris.

210
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:42,320
Lentokenttä or "Lentokenttä!" is a fake Swedish
thrash metal band formed in 1983 in Detroit.

211
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Wow!

212
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,320
Fake Swedish, what was that, something metal?

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,400
-Thrash.
-Thrash metal band.

214
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,680
So you've given me three entirely
plausible answers there.

215
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,560
Gary, let's start with you this time.

216
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Just get the s*** out of the way first.

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,360
We're going to probe this s*** now are we?

218
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
-Yes, Gary.
-It's a spider.

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,260
-Is that in shot?
-Yes!

220
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,960
Spider!

221
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
-Gary.
-Yeah.

222
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Lentokenttä,
could you tell me any more about it?

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,280
Well, the... the clue is actually in the title,
lento is a word that can be used in Finnish

224
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,760
to mean slow, so it's quite slow music
and it's quite mournful

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,360
and the nose flute,
though it may sound ridiculous,

226
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,120
when you think about it,
it actually makes perfect sense.

227
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,720
Mournful parp on the nose flute.

228
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Don't mock cultural traditions, Matthew!

229
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,240
We're going to mispronounce it,
we're going to mock them.

230
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah, because if you're in the kind of climes
that you get on the Russia/Finnish border,

231
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,520
you're going to have your mouth covered up
with a scarf.

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,840
So you're more likely to play these things
through your nose

233
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
because it's the bit
you leave uncovered to breathe.

234
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,680
Actually that's interesting because that makes
sense for the band name as well

235
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,960
because then it's a pun on how fast the music
is rather than being slow and mournful.

236
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,120
So yeah, it's slow, it's mournful,
it's kind of used at funerals

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,960
but it's just because your mouth is covered,
you have what is called a nose flute,

238
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,920
I can't really pronounce it properly
in Finnish,

239
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
but you play it by blowing down there
and it makes a slow and mournful noise.

240
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,160
Do you have to pronounce it through the
nose flute, is that why you can't do it?

241
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
It helps, I imagine.

242
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,800
Get him a couple of straws out of the kitchen
and see how he does.

243
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,480
Although I have just read a Wikipedia article
on this, I have not played a nose flute,

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
so I cannot comment in detail
on the experience.

245
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,520
No, you see, the problem is,
Tom once went to near-Russia

246
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,120
and nobody was being buried with a nose flute.

247
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,040
To be fair,
Matt and I have been to that border,

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
we have both…

249
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,960
we both literally sat just a metre
or two from that border.

250
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
It's a very long border though.

251
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
-It's a very long border.
-Pipes stuffed up each nostril playing…

252
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
The thing is, I don't actually find that
entirely implausible.

253
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,920
Thank you, because it's f***ing true,
that's why.

254
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,520
Matt, all you have said so far
is "region of Finland"

255
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,880
and I refuse to believe that in the time you
spent looking at

256
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,760
presumably just the first few paragraphs
of the Wikipedia article,

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
all you got was region of Finland.

258
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,960
If only there was a way of giving
myself more time to come up with the answer.

259
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Could you tell me more
about the region of Finland?

260
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,680
Yeah, it's in the south,
it's near Helsinki

261
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,640
and only 12 people live there...

262
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,440
ish.

263
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,800
-12ish.
-How big is this region?

264
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
I don't know, it didn't say,
but it's got an airport in it.

265
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
12 people and an airport.

266
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
Yet, it employs…

267
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,920
-I thought he was going to say Yeti.
-Yeti?

268
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
-Yeti!
-In an airport?

269
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
My brain went snowy. Yeti.

270
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,320
Welcome to Yeti Airport, Lentokenttä Yeti.

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,360
Yeah, but the Yeti's dressed as like a fifties
stewardess in my imagination.

272
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Hair coming out of the…
between the…

273
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,280
well, basically like this shirt.

274
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,680
No, it's a uniform designed for a Yeti,
isn't it?

275
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh, I want it squeezed in with all the fur.

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
No, I got that.

277
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,320
No, it's fully fitted to the Yeti, it's fine,
even the wee hat looks in proportion.

278
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,800
So that's quite a big hat then?

279
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Well, yeah, but you know,
on a Yeti it looks small.

280
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,840
Alright, is that all I'm getting from you?

281
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
It's a region, south of Finland.

282
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah.

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
12 people live there,
but it employs a couple of thousand

284
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,320
because there's an airport there.

285
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
Helsinki Airport,

286
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,680
Vantaa Airport, I think it's called
because that's the closest place,

287
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
but Helsinki's the place people go to.

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,360
This is worth it just for the pained
Tom expressions.

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,440
-It's such a lovely change in dynamics.
-It is, it is because twice in a row
we're talking about…

290
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
we've talked about Finland
and I've spent some time in Finland,

291
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
and I've been wrong on this before.

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800
And I immediately want to strike this off
because of course Helsinki Airport isn't…

293
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
it's near a town called Vantaa,
you've said it,

294
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
that it's Helsinki Vantaa Airport.

295
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,920
But I cannot conclusively say that the region
is not some area called Lentokenttä.

296
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Well, I can add one bit if it helps.

297
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,040
Sure?

298
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm not … I'm only going to get it slightly right
because I only read it a couple of minutes ago,

299
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
Airtropolis is kind of what they call the area.

300
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh, that's cool.

301
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,480
-Airtropolis?
-That is awesome.

302
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
Wow!

303
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,400
No. No, I'm ruling you out, Matt,
it's one of these two, I'm ruling you out.

304
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,960
That sounds like something out of LazyTown,
sorry, Airtropolis.

305
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,400
It's about the right scale, isn't it,
total population 12,

306
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,520
name of the area, Airtropolis.

307
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Full of talking planes.

308
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,320
And how can you think I'm lying?

309
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,800
Gary.

310
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh, here we go again.

311
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
You haven't even gone to Chris yet.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
Trustworthy face,
he can't see the lies through the beard.

313
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,720
Why am I getting a full body cavity search?

314
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,840
Because Chris came out…

315
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,520
Because to be fair,
yours mentions body cavities.

316
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah! Yeah it does.

317
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,800
Is the nose a cavity?

318
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah. Yes. Nasal cavity.

319
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,680
Look, it's a cavity,
I can put my fingers in it.

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,600
Well, I've never seen in a full body…

321
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,760
I mean a full body cavity search,
I've seen the odd…

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
up that, you know,
but I've never seen them go, and the nose.

323
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,880
You haven't watched enough episodes
of Border Force.

324
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,040
In fairness you're right on that front.

325
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm getting pins and needles from laughing!

326
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
I can't hear what he's saying, can you?

327
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,240
-He's got pins and needles from laughing.
-I'm getting pins and needles through laughing...

328
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,520
I think it's this posture.

329
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,840
His shirt is cutting off his circulation
to his hands.

330
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,600
It feels like I've laughed myself into...

331
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
He's laughed himself into a circulatory
disorder, look at what you've done.

332
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,960
A lot of coal miners died that way.

333
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,880
This isn't funny.

334
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,080
-This is how all the comedians go.
-Yes.

335
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,600
The reason I'm not going for Chris
is the 1983 Detroit, it's just…

336
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,680
That's because that's where
they were formed and when!

337
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Like I don't have much to ask you,

338
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,160
like do you know more about their music,
do you know about their…?

339
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,440
Six albums, broke up in 1990, one single
that bothered the charts for like metal,

340
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,400
if  whatever particular chart it is
came in at number 12.

341
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
The Billboard rock chart.

342
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
Billboard, whatever they're relevant to,

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,520
came in at number 12,
that was their brief spike

344
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,360
then sort of disbanded in ignomi...
ig-no-mi-ny.

345
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
That's easy for you to say.

346
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,040
It is if I put my teeth in now.

347
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,400
I think this is more likely
to be the fake metal…

348
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,280
the fake thrash metal band than it is…

349
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,000
No, they were a real thrash metal band,
they were fake Swedish.

350
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,200
-Fake Swedish.
-Because they're from Detroit.

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,560
I think that's more likely than funereal
border music based on the nose flute.

352
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,120
Here we go again.

353
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
So, Chris, I believe you, was I right?

354
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,840
No, it's bollocks. It's bu*******.

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Wrong.

356
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Matt?!

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,680
It's a region of Finland with 12 people
and an airport.

358
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,880
And I'm going to correct: Aviapolis.

359
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
-Aviapolis.
-Which is no less cool.

360
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,560
So both times, the person I have struck out
first has been the correct one.

361
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,120
The moral of this story,
don't be on jury service with Tom.

362
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
Don't be on trial when Tom's on jury service.

363
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Shall I give you a quick summary
not from my memory?

364
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
Yeah.

365
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,560
"Lentokenttä, which in English means airfield,

366
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,280
"is a district..."

367
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,520
I've killed them.

368
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,960
It means airfield!

369
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,480
"There's no such place!
I have flown into Helsinki,

370
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,920
-"it can't possibly be!"
-How did I not know the Finnish word for airport?!

371
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,720
It is a district of Vantaa.

372
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah. Helsinki Vantaa Airport.

373
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,920
And the district is part of the
Aviapolis major region

374
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,560
and has been named after
the Helsinki Airport situated there.

375
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,120
Helsinki, it's literally the Finnish
for airport, how did I not know that?

376
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,200
It's the largest single job concentration
of all of Vantaa, 11,000 people work there

377
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
but only 12 people live there.

378
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,160
Ah, yes.

379
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,040
"Can't possibly be! Strike it from the record,
no chance!"

380
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,600
What we've learned here is that I'm useless
without a laptop in front of me.

381
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,240
And that's why this game is good.

382
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,120
It works, baby. I love this.

383
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,160
That's been the Technical Difficulties,
that's been Chris Joel.

384
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
I demand a third!

385
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,000
That's been Gary Brannan.

386
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,720
That's been Matt Gray.

387
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
We'll see you next time.
