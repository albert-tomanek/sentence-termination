1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
*clap* Ah, there we are.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,180
So we have diagnostic information here, but we can also get a

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,620
3D view of what the Hololens actually sees.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,020
So this is the point cloud and or rather mesh that it's creating in real-time.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,080
As you can see that's the room was standing in.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,660
There's the table.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,700
That's the point of view of the Hololens in real time.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,140
First-person view.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,660
There is a bit of a delay.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,060
The Hololens does not need a cable of any sort. 
It's all on board.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,640
This is just to give a preview,

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,900
otherwise it's really laggy over Wi-Fi.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
*BLIP*BLIP*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*DIT*

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,860
Point it at me. Let's have a look at what I look like with this.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,920
So, can you be seen? Because it might...

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,020
Because you're effectively a dynamic mesh,

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,660
it might not be tracking you.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,760
-Are you actually showing up?
-Eh..something's there.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Maybe. Let's see if I update it...

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,280
And uh, give it a...

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,860
-Ah! Is there...
-Yes, something is there.

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,860
Okay.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Yep, and that is enough information for the Hololens to say

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,720
-"Right, there is some sort of object there."
-I can sort of see my camera there...

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,480
-Yep.
-Because I'm pointing at the laptop

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,240
-that's on the table.
-Alright

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,160
Do we have a...?

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,960
-Hold on, let's...
-Trying to stay still

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,900
Okay, and I'll just tell it to update the mesh.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,380
-Ah!
-There we are.

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,660
So this is basically a depth map of me is it?

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,220
Pretty much, yeah.

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,640
Well from this angle only.
I'll have to walk around otherwise.

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,120
I'm seeing some blinking red lights on you.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,080
That is the depth camera array that's on the top of the Hololens, very similar to a Kinect's,

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,020
so the exact cocktail of sensors 
is not very well known.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,800
Talking to you now,
I can sort of just see your eyes,

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,500
but it feels like I've walked 
a bit into the future here.

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,380
Indeed it is.

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,800
Of all the various head mounts we have,

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,180
this one is probably 
the more Star Treky of the lot.

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,260
-Haha
-Yeah

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,960
Just like the Kinect or 
the Tango and all those devices,

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,780
What it's doing is
reading the environment around it,

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,920
which is different from what, say
normal optical AR does.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,400
And by creating a measure to understand the environment around it.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,520
And we can start placing content there

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,160
So, as you can see that's

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,820
the example of the mesh,
what it's seeing.

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
The mesh it's creating in real time.

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,480
-Is it constantly updating that?
-All the time.

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,060
It's reading the environment
all the time,

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,800
and now this is a view,
exactly what I see.

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,740
So I can populate the world

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,440
around me with any
visual contact I want.

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,400
So this is the menu, basically.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,180
You should be able to it.
There we are.

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,120
So that is a hologram in space.

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,300
So let's go play some other stuff.
For example, my settings.

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,840
I can either place it in space,
just leave it there,

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,040
or I can go find a nice flat surface

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,580
like say, side of this printer,
and place it.

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,140
And that is now locked that that's where it

64
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,250
belongs

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,950
So, that is now a normal Windows 10 menu,

66
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,560
many of you will probably
have seen it before.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,180
There we are.

68
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,960
Or we can start placing 
other stuff.

69
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,620
Let's place a...

70
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,560
It's a theme we put around
three lines.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,020
-These demos usually.
-So that is now locked onto

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,860
the table.

73
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,020
It won't however, it won't move.
It is there.

74
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,440
Now the key thing here unlike most

75
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
of the other AR solutions
 we have seen is

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,599
as soon as these sensors have an

77
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,430
understanding of depth,
 they can deal

78
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,040
with the occlusion problem.

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,240
So the occlusion problem is where 
the...any AR solution

80
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,540
doesn't exactly know what it's looking at.

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,080
Now, so, and in which case it
draws the digital content above

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,520
everything,
so if you've used any AR,

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,040
any mobile phone-based AR
with a marker,

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,020
you have probably tried putting your 
hand in front of the marker

85
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,240
to see if it occludes
the virtual content or

86
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,000
if anybody tries to
pick stuff up.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,420
Normally, with marker-based AR, 
that simply won't work.

88
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,700
All it can really do is tie
content that marker,

89
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,780
but in this case it,
does have a sense of depth,

90
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,420
so it can effectively read
your hand

91
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
and stop drawing content over it,
so if I put my

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,940
hand over the cat, right
you can see now

93
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,240
it is not working
because it hasn't

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,420
triggered from my hand just yet,
but it will eventually catch on.

95
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,920
If you went and kinda looked
behind this laptop,

96
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,570
- will the cat disappear behind this laptop?
- Uh, it should.

97
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,580
Assuming the the device has actually
read the laptop.

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,100
Let's have a go.
Oh, that is stuck.

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,080
- Does the stickiness
happen quite often or is it..?

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,940
- No, it's only for the preview
really.

101
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,060
- Oh so basically it's
because we're looking on the laptop

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,460
- Indeed, it's a little bit of a debug view.

103
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
As far as my experience goes
on the Hololens,

104
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,320
everything is smooth.

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,260
Oh, there we are.

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,840
So, let's have a look.

107
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
So it looks like we don't have a lot of
occlusions here.

108
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,780
No, my laptop doesn't seem to
want to hide it.

109
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,860
The problem with the room here

110
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,240
is there's not a lot of stuff
to hide behind.

111
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
So let's try something else.

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,800
So, if I was to take a another
hologram and place it

113
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,740
behind something like sit on the floor
over here.

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,620
Right.

115
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,700
There we are, I can see the dog

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,760
and now the table's in the way.
Can't see it.

117
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,600
- Yeah, ok.
- Yep so, this is a case where the geometry

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,150
has been correctly read,
so the Hololens is sure

119
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,560
that that is a static feature
in my environment.

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,280
So it now has built geometry.

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,600
As we saw before actually,
we can switch back to

122
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,580
the previous view.

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,280
There we are.

124
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,780
So, this is the geometry
that it is using for the occlusion.

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,980
- Oh, so you can see that table there...
- Yep.

126
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,560
-and it's not perfectly smooth.
- Exactly, so previously the cat

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,280
could not be hidden 
behind the laptop because

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
as you can see, the laptop
is shown up as a short mesh.

129
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,580
If I had kept moving, 
it probably would have hidden it.

130
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,520
The table though is a nice solid
object.

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,880
(it's got that)
 and the dog is hiding

132
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,000
hiding behind the table,
so I can see the

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,220
hologram from here.
you probably cannot on

134
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,800
the screen now because
we're seen the preview.

135
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,540
But as I move and I'm
behind the table, it's hidden.

136
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,200
This has not systematically
scanned the entire room

137
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
- and got geometry exactly.
- Mhm

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
So, are we looking at a trade-off with that?

139
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,180
Yes. Yes. Seeing as this is an entirely
on-board process,

140
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,940
so unlike say, 
all the virtual reality headsets

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,600
we've seen, this does not
 require a desktop computer.

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,680
It's basically mobile phone strapped
to my face, just like the Tango.

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,860
There is continuously a trade-off between 
speed and performance,

144
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,040
so if you want to maintain
the experience that everything is smooth,

145
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,680
say about 30 frames per second for all the content

146
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,900
I'm seeing,  it's going
to start cutting corners.

147
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,220
and it also goes down to the basically the capabilities

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,220
of the sensors.
How much granularity can they pick up.

149
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,300
How much detail, so you'll see that

150
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,920
they kind of tend to cut corners,

151
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,750
will ignore clatter on the tables.

152
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,340
They're not very good with
see through surfaces,

153
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,920
so for example, the glass walls
over here as you can see,

154
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,860
they will simply not register.
Because it all comes down

155
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,800
to computer vision in this case,
but computer vision on the sensors.

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,840
Just like we have seen with
 other AR stuff when

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,300
it's through a some sort 
of glass case or what-have-you.

158
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,420
The cameras actually see the reflections,
but unlike our brains,

159
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,000
they did not know to discard them.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,900
So they don't really know
what to do with them.

161
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,900
The depth sensors so in this case,
I see straight through them.

162
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,460
So that is both a good 
thing and a bad thing,

163
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,040
depending on your on how
 you want to apply it

164
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,710
So, I could place a hologram there, but it

165
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,840
wouldn't necessarily see it as a wall.

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,300
So, let's see what we can do.

167
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,620
Of course it's not all 
just placing Holograms around

168
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,500
Right off the bat, it's the idea that

169
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,150
you can use the environment around you

170
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,360
as you're, well, computer environment,

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,730
so if you could just transplant your

172
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,060
everyday desktop use into the
environment.

173
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,740
So I can place a Word file over there,

174
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,940
I can put my browser on my ceiling,

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,520
make a massive screen.

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,860
Eh, obviously there are a lot of uses

177
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,300
in entertainment, so the games
 on this thing are pretty good.

178
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,820
They will use the environment,

179
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,260
you can use the physics of your-
 the environment around you.

180
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,200
So you can have a ball bounce,

181
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,920
on the table,
bounce on the floor.

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,225
People have tried this kind of gesture-based

183
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,680
and moving around kind of 
interfaces for computing before

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
And it doesn't really seem to take off.

185
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,320
People are quite comfortable
 with a keyboard and a mouse,

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
or some kind of trackpad.

187
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,420
Indeed.

188
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,600
Weirdly, this is probably the first
examples where I've seen people

189
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,800
just click with it.

190
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,420
So it's only really got to gestures that recognizes,

191
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,940
the click and the menu,
but that is enough.

192
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,260
It is. It is enough for you to be

193
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,100
able to do basic interaction such as

194
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,350
drag stuff around, scroll around, select things

195
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,680
in a way you normally might, you know,

196
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,820
pointing at something is a
is a normal interaction

197
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,840
and translates quite well.

198
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,820
And it's the it's also reliability factor,

199
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,700
so one of the reasons these
 things don't catch on

200
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,320
Is because usually don't work.

201
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,680
They have a, you know,
you're sitting there tapping

202
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,220
things, this one is just registering 
and working quite well.

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,860
The two gestures for example, the the bloom 
"my bloom" it's called,

204
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,800
just works reliably every time.

205
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,280
Same as the other main interaction which is the

206
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,640
click, so I'm not, well there we go.

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,300
Every time I click, 
we get a update of the mesh.

208
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
You can see how it's
reading the mesh there,

209
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,180
the environment around it.

210
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,740
Or if I want to get rid of windows,
just point out what I want

211
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,900
and remove.

212
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,130
There, we do have a bit of a problem.

213
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,530
Yes, I can select things and there are

214
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,440
two gestures that work very reliably,

215
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,260
but what were missing is a cursor.

216
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,800
Yes, I do have a cursor in
 the middle of like a,

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,780
like a crosshair in the
 middle of my view.

218
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,470
But that means I'm relying on the

219
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,720
direction of my head in order to

220
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,300
basically look at something,

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,080
center it in the middle of my screen 
and then select it.

222
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,300
Um, this is a good and bad thing.

223
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,770
There are various interaction methods to do this,

224
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,270
maybe, I could point at something.

225
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,279
But you see that pointing is actually not

226
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
one of the most accurate things in the world.

227
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,660
We have some other studies with

228
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,280
other interfaces where you can see that

229
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,820
people think they're pointing at something

230
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,390
but really they're pointing

231
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,640
with an arm,
they're pointing with a wrist,

232
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,860
they're pointing with a finger.

233
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,060
So, getting a system that understands 
the intent of the user is pretty difficult,

234
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,440
but gaze is pretty solid.

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,060
We have a crosshair,
we aim at we want

236
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,600
- we select it.
- We're seeing a preview here

237
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,700
which is a camera on the
front of the device in this view.

238
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,560
Is your field of view a lot wider than that?

239
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,820
Can you see more stuff?

240
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,040
If you're looking at that cat,
 what can you see at the sides

241
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
- of your arms?
-That is a very good question.

242
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,050
That's actually one of the

243
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,320
things that well surprises
 most people when they put this on.

244
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,460
The field of view is actually that narrow.

245
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,220
view is actually fat narrow,

246
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,410
unlike pretty much every headset just right now.

247
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,210
This is a proper heads-up display,

248
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,980
meaning it's not like the Google Glasses

249
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,490
where I have my real vision and then a

250
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,070
second window up in the corner, giving me a

251
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,839
version of the real world.

252
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,750
This is directly adding content to my normal

253
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,440
vision

254
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,170
The problem is the area that it has to

255
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,080
add this content is really very narrow.

256
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,490
I think that's the equivalent of a

257
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,040
15-inch screen at normal distance,

258
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,560
so really my field of view of augmented

259
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,040
content and it sounds bad, but it's not

260
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,550
that bad, is really just this angle over here.

261
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,820
- It's really narrow.
- But you can see at the sides, can you?

262
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,000
Uh, yes. Yes I can see.

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,920
It's all perfectly clear, so I can

264
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,280
see the cat now.
It's in the center of my

265
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,830
vision, but if I move my head ever so

266
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,080
slightly, at this point, the cat is

267
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,990
outside my augmented field of view.

268
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,089
It is quite narrow, but this is a technology

269
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,190
limitation that my understanding is has

270
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,140
already been overcome. It's again a

271
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,800
trade-off between cost and performance.

272
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,190
These are developer kits after all,

273
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,580
so they're already pretty pricey.
If they were to

274
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,460
have a proper field of you, probably the

275
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,270
weight and power requirements would have

276
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,620
made them quite unwieldy other time.

277
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
You know, the launch works very well.
It's Cortana.

278
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,620
- So umm...
- Should we try and put it on the camera?
-Yep.

279
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,000
- Let's see if this works.
- Okay, so...Whoops.

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,420
- It's not gonna work on b[oth]
- I'll have to look out through one

281
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,900
- of the eyes I guess.
- Oh yeah yeah.

282
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
- Oh. Hold on. Yep, I see content.
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,840
- Oh, there we are.
- Oh, Okay.

284
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,620
- Okay, so uh
- So, do you want to hold that against there?

285
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,300
- Yep, aim on other account. 
Ok, then we-

286
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,560
- sure enough, there's content.
- Mhm.

287
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,380
- There's more content.
- Is the cat still there?

288
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,440
- Yeah there's...
Oh hold on, I'm doing it now.

289
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,180
- Uh, we move forward.
- Oh, there we go.

290
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,640
- Yeah it's quite interesting to see that line,
 isn't it?

291
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,100
So, if I put this on the cat's nose
 for instance,

292
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,700
and then what?
Click or something?

293
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,350
- Yep. So, whenever you can interact with

294
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,560
something, the dot will turn into a circle.

295
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,940
- Ah, okay
- Indeed. And also, when it sees

296
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,740
fingers and it says
"Okay, you're ready to click."

297
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,800
Same thing.
