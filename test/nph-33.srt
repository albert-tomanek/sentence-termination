00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,300
So recently, there's an article on the news about

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,060
a computer which had sold for 200,000 dollars.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,840
The computer itself, an Apple 1,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
built by Steve Wozniak back in the seventies,

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,340
had originally only sold for 666 dollars.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
But, a woman had taken it to a

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,960
recycling center, and effectively thrown it away.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
The company's now trying to attract the woman,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
so they can share the profits they've made from

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,240
selling it.  But just why was this computer

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
so special?  And what was it made of?

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,100
So, the story of the Apple 1 takes us back

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,220
to the [U.S.] West Coast in the mid seventies.

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,780
Steve Wozniak was happily working at HP

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,780
designing calculators, and he went along

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,780
to one of the early meetings of the

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,220
Homebrew Computer Club, where he

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,220
thought he was going to talk about

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,080
TV terminals and being able to connect

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
to the ARPAnet for a TV,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,080
but actually, everyone was talking about

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,000
the cover of Popular Electronics,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,260
where the MITS Altair 8800

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,140
had just appeared on the cover.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,140
It was probably the first computer that used

26
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,580
a microprocessor as its CPU,

27
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,960
rather than building it discretely out of logic chips.

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,960
If you want to know more about it, click here,

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,680
where Jason at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,520
will explain theirs, they have the serial number 3.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,020
Wozniak hadn't even heard of these CPUs at the time,

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,340
but was interested, and he was given a data sheet

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,860
for the 8080, which was at the heart

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,100
of the machine, and took it home,

35
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,680
and began to look over it.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,020
And he realized that it was very similar to a computer

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
he'd built previously out of

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,020
discrete logic components,

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
which he called "the cream soda computer"

40
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,020
because he'd built it out of cream soda cans

41
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,660
for the case.

42
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,280
So he started looking at this, and

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,220
very quickly realized that he could design

44
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,160
a computer based around this,

45
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,580
using very few chips in the CPU,

46
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,240
some RAM, some ROM

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
and put it together to build a complete computer

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,860
for much less than the cost of the Altair.

49
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
He then realized that he could link it in

50
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
to a terminal he'd built.  And the terminal

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,520
was just a machine that you could use to connect

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,760
to ARPAnet through a normal television;

53
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,700
which he'd done there. Now, ARPAnet was the

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,880
forerunner, in those days, of the Internet;

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
and so he'd built this system that could connect to it

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,480
through a cheap domestic television set.

57
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,580
Rather than having to use lots and lots of lights

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,700
on the front of your Altair to communicate with it,

59
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,480
just use a television screen; it'd be much easier

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
to communicate through that.

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,840
And you could put a proper typewriter keyboard in it,

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
and produce a system.  So he worked out these things.

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,020
He reused his circuit for his television terminal,

64
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,940
connected that up to the logic

65
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,140
inside his CP -- his computer he'd designed,

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,120
put it together with a keyboard; and he'd managed to design --

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,260
he hadn't built it at that point -- a complete computer.

68
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,020
He then looked at the design, and someone he was working with

69
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,560
suggested he look at a different CPU called the 6800

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
because it was considerably cheaper and

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
you could get one, as an HP employee,

72
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
for about 40 dollars.

73
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,320
So he redesigned the system using that,

74
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,660
and he also looked at RAM; and he'd originally considered

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,660
using what was called static RAM,

76
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,660
but then decided, because it was cheaper again,

77
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,420
to use what's called dynamic RAM,

78
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,420
and he'd managed to get a good deal on some

79
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,900
dynamic RAM as well.

80
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
So he'd redesigned his circuit.  And then,

81
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,800
he'd heard about a new chip, which was the 6502.

82
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,960
This chip is used in lots and lots of computer systems,

83
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
right through to the mid-eighties;

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,720
things like the BBC Micro, the Commodore 64,

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
and so on.  So, he redesigned the circuit

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
again around this, although it was just basically

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
plugging in the new chip.

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
And he then went off to build

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,460
the computer.  Normally,

90
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,460
something like the Altair, and other computers

91
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
at that time, you would program them

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,460
by having switches on the front to

93
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
type in the memory locations and

94
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,100
the data that you wanted to store there.

95
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,940
What Wozniak realized, because he was working with

96
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
calculators at the time, at HP, is that

97
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,940
calculators were effectively computers

98
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
to some extent.  They had programs,

99
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,680
they had processors - they did things,

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,800
you'd put input.  But the calculators started up

101
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
straightaway because the program was burnt

102
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
into the ROM inside it, so

103
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
he programmed his initial program

104
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
for the, what became the Apple 1,

105
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
into some ROM, and put that

106
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,660
into a system so his computer

107
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
would start up straightaway with what he called his

108
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
monitor program, so the user could see the

109
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,800
data on the TV screen, and they could

110
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,180
input the data using a standard keyboard.

111
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,960
And it's perhaps this

112
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,340
that made the difference between the Apple 1

113
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
and everything that followed it,

114
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,340
and what had come before in terms of [units?].

115
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Because before, yep, you could plug

116
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
a keyboard in; yep, you could plug

117
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,620
a video display in.  But actually, most of the time,

118
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,620
you're entering the data, to get it started

119
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,960
at least, via the toggles on the front.

120
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
What Steve Wozniak's genius moment was,

121
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
was that he actually replaced that

122
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
with a small bit of program built into the system

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
and a VDU display,

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
using a typical telly, and a

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
keyboard for entry.  So you went from being

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
something that only hardware hackers

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
were perhaps comfortable with, to the forerunner of

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
the PC that we know today.

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
So Steve Wozniak built the, uh,

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
the Apple - what became the Apple 1

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
for himself, and he took it to the

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Homebrew Computer Club and started showing it

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
around to the other people there.  And of course,

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
he showed it to his friend, Steve Jobs.

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
And Steve Jobs realized that while

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
other people in the computer club were

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
taking copies of the schematics, they weren't

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
actually building it themselves.  And

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,780
so he said to Wozniak,

140
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,780
"Why don't we make up some circuit boards

141
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,920
ourselves, and actually sell them to people?"

142
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
They could make the boards for 20 dollars,

143
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
sell the kits for 40 dollars including all the

144
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,680
components, and still make profit.

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
People would see them as a deal, because they were getting

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
all the parts.  And,

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Wozniak wasn't perhaps sure at first, but he -

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Steve Jobs turned to him and said, "Look,

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,920
whatever happens, if we fail,

150
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
we can at least have got a company

151
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
to our name.  We'll have made a company."

152
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
And Wozniak liked this idea.  And so together,

153
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
they started a small company called Apple.

154
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,000
So, if you want to find out more

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
about the history of the Apple 1 and Apple itself,

156
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,300
I can recommend two books.

157
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,440
Steve Wozniak's biography iWoz

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
goes into the details about

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,900
how he created it,

160
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,180
and what he was doing at the time.

161
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,140
Great read.

162
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,880
And also, if you're interested in the

163
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,960
technical side of it,

164
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,600
there's this book, The Apple I Replica Creation,

165
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
where Tom Owad

166
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,940
goes into how you can actually build your own

167
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Apple 1; goes through how to program it, and so on.

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,940
Looks at the hardware inside it.

169
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,920
Both great reads and available from your all usual bookshops.
