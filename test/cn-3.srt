1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
This is The Technical Difficulties,
and we are playing

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,760
Two of These People are Lying because
two of these people will be,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,640
-and they are Chris Joel.
-Hello.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,480
-Gary Brannan.
-Good day… oh no, bollocks, no.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,520
Start again,
I should do a proper line there, shouldn't I?

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,960
And Matt Gray.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,240
You've missed your chance.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,560
It's f***ing unfair, you know,

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,800
you'll never know what it was going to be
but it was absolutely peach.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,520
And what we're doing today is: Tom is going
to try and see which one of us three are lying.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,640
We have all gone through our phones,
looked at a Wikipedia article,

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,480
a different one each, written down the title on
a piece of paper down here and Tom picks one.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,840
One of us tells the truth
about what that article is about,

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
yes, you can see the pen all over me

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,960
and the other two lie
because we've never seen the article before.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,520
Alright, are we all ready?

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,840
Well, yeah,
I demonstrated my readiness at the start.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,640
We are looking for Duryard or a Duryard.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,080
-Durr-yard, D'yard. Duryard.
-Da yard!

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,020
Matt, why don't you kick us off?

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh, w-- can I...

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,840
Have a drink of tea, have a think.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
"Drinkin' my tea, ain't I?"

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
I should … I should point out that …

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,320
that apparently there may be swaps of
handwriting going on here so I cannot tell

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,160
who has written… written Duryard.

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Matt, why don't you kick us off?

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Anton Duryard, a cricketer, unfortunately,
I was reading the article,

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,240
I knew none of the words,
so I'm going to have to bluff this one.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
Gary can make some up.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,560
Well, the article was just "Duryard".

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,700
-Yeah.
-Like Prince.

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,680
He was just known as Duryard?

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,720
-Only the bat.
-Alright.

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,160
-Gary.
-A town in the south... west. Of Britain.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,360
Chris.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,880
Which is weird because it must be named…

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,240
the town that I found in Nebraska
must be named for it.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,440
That's good, that's good, that's good.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Oh, now, either that's a brilliant strategy

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,600
or Gary pre-empted whatever is going on here.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,480
We're going to,
we're going to start with Matt,

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Matt. The cricketer, did you understand
any of the cricket terms that were in there?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Not really but the reason he is known
as Duryard is because when he…

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm going to have to use a proper cricketing
phrase here: "did a good thing".

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,600
Did a good thing!

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,640
He was known for going "Duryard!"
and there's a photo of him on the article

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,120
with like both hands up,
like that kind of thing, yeah.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,520
-Sorry both hands up and what?
-Into the camera, please.

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Yeah, so he just called…
he is given the mononym from his…

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
from his cry let's say.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,680
The word mononym has suddenly slightly
convinced me that this is not rubbish.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,840
Alright.

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,600
Do you know what he did that was good?

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,360
No, it wasn't like once, it was whenever…

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
-Oh, right…
-How is it, he got points or…

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,120
Runs, I believe the term is.
Any time he got the runs...

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,480
He went "Duryard!"

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
Or, "Duryard..."

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
Grew up in Australia,

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,040
and it might have said New South Wales?

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,240
-Is that a place in Australia?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,600
That was either a really good bluff or…

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
You know what I'm like with places.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Unless they're Latin named, yes.

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
This tea idea has really worked out for him,
hasn't it?

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,960
I just really want a drink!
I poured it earlier,

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,080
when I'm coming up with the article,
setting up the cameras,

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
and I didn't have time to drink it.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah, he was in New South Wales in Australia

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,240
and it said something about his cricketing
career in different places

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,240
and was it, like,
T20 something-or-other in it?

73
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,360
-It said different cricketing things.
-You perked up there, Gary.

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,360
-It's just the way I'm sat.
-"Oh, the T20!"

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,320
So the T20 is actually a cricket thing.

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,440
"The very fast cricket."

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,880
So either these are things that were in the
article that you've plucked words out of

78
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,340
-or they're things in the back of…
-"Too much! Slow it down."

79
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,560
Are you okay there?

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,280
We're talking about cricket,
you carry on doing the episode.

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
Or they're…

82
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
or they're things in the back of your head,
well, I'm not sure on that, alright,

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
-Gary.
-Yes.

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Duryard, a town in the south-west of the UK?

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
-Yes.
-Yeah. What's… what's there?

86
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
Exeter.

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,760
Is this a small town spread very thin
around Exeter?

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,440
It's a county town,
it has an entire county in it!

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Hands up, I misunderstood your question,

90
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,200
I thought you were asking what's in the
south-west to which my answer was Exeter.

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,080
I didn't realise you were asking
about the town of Duryard.

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
Is Duryard famous for anything?

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,720
For being…
for the people who live there,

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,640
it's the centre of their existence, thank you
very much, most of which are students.

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,960
-Students. Duryard, Duryard U.
-Duryard … Duryard University.

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,520
-Wait, because it's near Exeter.
-Yeah.

97
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,200
That students at the
University of Exeter live there.

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,840
There's probably a meaning behind it.

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,200
Well, the other two players here are…
both have their head in their hands.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,400
And well they might, at the rightness
of the information I am imparting to you.

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm just imagining the hoodies that say
Duryard U.

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,920
Well, it's not, it's Exeter,
it's the hall of a place they live.

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,480
What I like about these, Gary,
is that whether you're telling the truth or not,

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,720
you are extremely confident
in what you're saying.

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,160
Chris, the town in Nebraska.

106
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
The real town…

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,600
Unlike, I don't know,
some places in the south-west of England.

108
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,160
One of us speaks the truth,
the other only lies.

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,960
Duryard, Nebraska,
incorporated 1870 by Charles Duryard,

110
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,360
notable for nothing very much

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,560
being in the corn belt, except a stopping place
for the late westward expansion.

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
Westwood!

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Westward expansion, not Westwood,

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
Westwood is not expanding.

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,440
I don't know,
he's getting older, isn't he, he's probably…

117
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh no, he's a thin one, he's a thin one.

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,060
-Is he still...?
-He's still svelte, yeah.

119
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,560
I mean, my respect to him,

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,440
I've not managed it and I'm at least
five years younger than him.

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean I'm just going to cut
straight to the chase on this one,

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,560
I think it's Chris.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Matt, I…
I appreciate Anton Duryard.

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,400
And so does New South Wales.

125
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I appreciate the word mononym
that came out of nowhere.

126
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,120
-I love the word mononym.
-And many things that...

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,640
but I believe you've pulled them
from your head, I don't think it's you.

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
-You're going to be sad.
-Gary, Gary,

129
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,440
I don't think there's a town called
Duryard near Exeter where there's a university.

130
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,080
Fine, I didn't say university though.

131
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
Chris, I believe you, am I right?

132
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,120
No, there isn't a university in
Duryard, Nebraska either.

133
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,760
-There is no Duryard, Nebraska?
-There is no Duryard, Nebraska.

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,400
So we already know I'm wrong.

135
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,160
So two of the people you've just been
really quite dismissive about…

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,840
At least 50% of them have every right
to be very upset,

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,680
I would say more like 75
the way you've treated some of them.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,880
And, and one of us kept coming up with facts
when you were asking

139
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,520
and the other one kept talking
around in circles.

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,800
One of the two people opposite us
did the thing you like

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,880
which is give key details.

142
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Matt, Matt, have I have I picked your article
for the third time in a row?

143
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,200
-Are you saying it's me?
-Yeah.

144
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,080
I was the one that was
talking around in circles.

145
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,320
-He kept giving you facts.
-I did!

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,360
There's a town called Duryard
with a university in it?

147
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,600
-Duryard.
-Yeah.

148
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,240
"...is an ancient area of Exeter in Devon,
once the hunting land of the Anglo-Saxon kings.

149
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,880
"The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon dear,
which means deer, and geard, which means fold.

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,900
"Today, much of the area is occupied by the
University of Exeter

151
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,960
"which has a hall of residence named Duryard."

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,040
Blimey! No...

153
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,920
-Unfortunately…
--F*** you up the wrong'un.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
Unfortunately, Gary,

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,780
-that means you get no points.
-Why?!

156
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,120
Because you did not convince me
of the truth.

157
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
Well, that's a shame, but I had fun.

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,440
-"Will ye come back next week, Gary?"
-I will!

159
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,400
-"Ah, it'll be grand to see you."
-I had a great time!

160
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,960
Chris, you get a point for successfully
convincing me of…

161
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,560
of a town in Nebraska
with the western expansion.

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
Matt, I mean, good…
good cricket knowledge.

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
Thank you,
I know nothing about cricket.

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,760
Gary, I will point out that I asked the
question, "what's in Duryard",

165
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,000
and your answer wasn't "a university"
or "a hall of residence", it was, and I quote,

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,320
"Exeter".

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,360
No, you said… you said "Duryard,
a town in the south-west, what's there",

168
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
to which I said "Exeter".

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Was I wrong?

170
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
I beg to the honourable member,
did I give a mistruth?

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,000
It is not my fault if you can't understand
your own bloody question.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
He has a point.

173
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Gary's going to go off
and get a replacement article,

174
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
we'll see you in a minute.

175
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,220
Good luck, chaps,
we are talking about...

176
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,440
Willoughby Run.

177
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,360
Gary, I'm going to come to you first,
what is Willoughby Run?

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,840
-It is a creek in Pennsylvania.
-Oh, that's a surprisingly solid answer.

179
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
You see, I'm batting you round like a cat,

180
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,440
one minute he's all shaky,
next he's all confident,

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,960
but last time I was shaky,
I was telling the truth.

182
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
That's not how the game's meant to work, Gary.

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,920
-It's got you on your toes though, to be fair.
-Yeah, well.

184
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,760
Oh, he not sure now!

185
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
Yes, Willoughby Run is a creek in Pennsylvania.

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
Chris, Willoughby Run?

187
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,640
It is a geological formation on the
Willoughby estate derived from the sort of thing

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,640
that is currently happening at the Willoughby Run in Pennsylvania due to erosion.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,760
-An eroding...?
-River valley.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
An eroding river valley.

191
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Matt, Willoughby Run?

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,720
It is an album by jazz multi-instrumentalist,
Roland Kirk.

193
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,000
Roland Kirk.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,280
-It’s a good jazz name.
-It's a good jazz name.

195
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,440
-"That's a jazz name, motherf*****".
-That's...

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,760
-Sorry! Wrong meeting.
-That's okay.

197
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,200
-Gary, let's start with you.
-Yes.

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Is there anything in the article other than
"it's a creek in Pennsylvania"?

199
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,760
-Adams County.
-Adams County.

200
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Pennsylvania, I think it's the Herr Creek

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
or the Herr River it flows into,

202
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,600
-Hurr!
-As in H-e-r-r, so Mr River.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,280
-Alright.
-There's a picture of it.

204
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,800
What does it look like?
Can you describe it for us?

205
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, trees in water.

206
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
Trees in water.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
-Trees in water.
-Alright.

208
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,200
It's like you get in America, you know,
you get shallow water with all trees in it.

209
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Alright.

210
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,160
This is… this is plausible because I can't…

211
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,520
in my head there isn't a big connection
between, like, "run" and the name of a river

212
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,720
so I feel like that's not something
that would come straight to your head,

213
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,800
so alright, I'll go with that. Chris.

214
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
-Hello.
-"You don't have the intelligence

215
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,560
-"to come up with a lie that complex."
-No, it's more than…

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,600
-"You idiot boy!"
-It's more that Chris has the exact same thing,

217
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,920
that I don't … like, "run" as a river thing,
as a geological feature,

218
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,080
you have some geological knowledge,
geographical knowledge?

219
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,160
I have a little bit
of geological knowledge, yes.

220
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
Tell me about Willoughby Run.

221
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Willoughby Run is a v-shaped valley formed
in Cheshire on the former Willoughby estate

222
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,440
which dug through the native limestone
which is quite soft,

223
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,520
exposing chert nodules for which it is famous.

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,440
Exposing what?

225
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,760
Chert nodules.

226
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
Could you…
could you tell me about the chert nodules?

227
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,320
Chert… chert is a very hard rock that forms in
weird sort of reniform nodules.

228
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,120
-Reniform?
-Kidney shaped.

229
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,960
-Okay. That makes sense.
-Renal, yeah.

230
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
Latin.

231
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,400
He's got a Latin GCSE, do you remember?

232
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,880
This guy, this guy.

233
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Which then get distributed in softer rock
when they rest sediment… er...

234
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,240
sedimentarily, because they don't get to erode
as fast as the rock that they came out of.

235
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,360
That's lovely and I absolutely believe
that's true and all from your head

236
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,400
and not from the article.

237
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,160
Not one bit.

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,720
A v-shaped… what did you call it,
something valley?

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,280
River erosion valley.
There's two shapes of valleys.

240
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, you see that's also plausible.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Matt, an album by Roland Kirk,
do you know who Roland Kirk is?

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,960
No. But I looked on the list of
who was in the article, like the…

243
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,680
there is like a track list of the album

244
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,680
and the first track was co-written
by Burt Bacharach.

245
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
-Burt Bacharach?
-I know.

246
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,360
It was Burt Bacharach
and I think there's a producer,

247
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,520
the album's… what?

248
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Sorry, I just remembered from years ago,

249
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,440
the phrase "Burt Bacharach
Back Sack and Crack".

250
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,160
It's just... and I can't tell if that's a joke
you're pulling back out of nowhere

251
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
or if genuinely Roland Kirk
worked with Burt Bacharach.

252
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
Who is Roland Kirk?
You could have just made that name up.

253
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,720
I know I could
and I have done every other time

254
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,600
but actually today I haven't made up the name
Roland Kirk.

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
It's an actual jazz multi-instrumentalist.

256
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,920
And it said…
this name I'm probably getting wrong,

257
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
it said that the album was produced
by Hal Moomin?

258
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
I must have got that wrong
because it's not Moomin,

259
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,400
but it's something similar to that.

260
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,720
And I vaguely recognised that name
but I didn't know why

261
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
and I didn't follow through
to the other article,

262
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,720
but he co-wrote some of the songs.

263
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,880
And I was scrolling through the track
which was about 10 tracks.

264
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,760
Later on in the album there was a track
that was co-written by two Beatles.

265
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,680
Which two?

266
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,840
Paul McCartney. John Lennon.

267
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,880
It could be an obscure Beatles number
they're covering.

268
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,360
Oh, possibly, yeah. Alright.

269
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,960
- It was from '65, that album.
-Because that'll be the right time,

270
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,640
but I can't remember when the first Beatles
records came out.

271
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,800
If you've picked the wrong year in the 60s,
that's a really obvious clue.

272
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,160
I'm pretty sure it said '65 on the article.

273
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,680
I realise this is the last one we're doing

274
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,320
but I…

275
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,200
in all of the six we've done so far,
this is by far the hardest decision.

276
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,840
All three of these are plausible.

277
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
We've finally learnt the game, chaps.

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,880
Says you. Me and Matt have both scored points.

279
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
-Chris.
-Hello.

280
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,040
-I'm going to rule you out because…
-You bellend.

281
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,760
I think pretty much everything there
has come from your head.

282
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,880
The only connection that I can't see there is
that "run" connected to a geological feature.

283
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,320
I think that … I think you might have
pulled this from your geology,

284
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,520
so I'm going to rule you out on this one.

285
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,040
Matt, I am really tempted to ask the Google
Assistant that I know you have in here

286
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,600
to just...
just play Willoughby Run by Roland Kirk.

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,280
But actually, Gary,
I think you gave few details this time,

288
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,120
you didn't come up with something
out of nowhere.

289
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Gary, I believe you, am I right?

290
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,240
-You are correct.
-Yes!

291
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,520
-A point for the both of you.
-Oh!

292
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,360
And there is Willoughby Run.

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,480
-Oh, that's lovely.
-All trees in water!

294
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Hey, it is.

295
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
It is absolutely all trees in water.

296
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,000
-There you go.
-Yeah, thank you very much, folks.

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
That's the end of the series.

298
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,880
We still don't have an outro.

299
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
-Bye!
-Bye!

300
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
But here's something for the end of the video,
I knew this was the last one we were doing.

301
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,880
I was telling you about the Roland Kirk album
'Slightly Latin'.

302
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,800
Oh, you're metagaming this.
I don't like this(!)
