1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
So most people make their money from... uh

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,740
not writing boxed applications but actually writing

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,740
custom software and making kind of

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,060
improvements to software, and fixing software for other people.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,560
And actually free software is a wonderful place to do that kind of work.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
I've been doing free software for a long time.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,340
Previously I worked... uh... way, way back now... 10 years ago

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,420
in NHS IT. It's the National Health Service IT project

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,800
based in Leeds, in the UK.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,800
And my job there was really to maintain... um...

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,160
some free software we were using to power our website.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,940
So we had... um... a thing called Plone.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,360
And we were using Apache and Linux and GNU and Debian

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,440
And all these other things to kind of

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,160
make this thing happen.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,260
So my job was primarily to make sure that kept working

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
to add features to it, to add new functionality

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,140
and to kind of maintain it.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,000
And so I was paid to do that job

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,480
And I left there, went to the University of Manchester,

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,280
And had a job that also paid me to make and maintain free software.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,800
And there's kind of an overriding pattern here, where I did that for a lot of my jobs.

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,760
At the free software foundation, my job was more focused on campaigning.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,920
I was the masterhead behind some campaigns like

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,980
Defective by Design, Windows 7 Sins, PlayOgg for a coupla years.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,640
So I would write articles

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,460
and I would do a lot of editorial-type work

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,460
on those things.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,200
But at the same time, maintaining my own free software projects... uh...

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
in my spare time.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,100
And now I'm at Creative Commons,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
and Creative Commons - surprise, surprise -

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,220
pays me to uh... look after free software projects

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,460
and to maintain and write free software.

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,220
And so, um,

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,220
if you would like to work in this kind of field,

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,940
I would suggest you... become reasonably good at programming,

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,520
you know your licenses, know your background

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,200
and kind of have a... strong desire to make free software a reality

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
and people need free software developers.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,940
Um, WordPress is a great example of a very, very

42
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,120
common piece of free software,

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,860
that's not going away anytime soon.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
People will always need people to write plugins,

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,640
help the people, be supportive

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,140
Um, write themes, write add-ons for WordPress

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
And if you're really good at free software development,

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,120
then you can even, y'know, work on WordPress itself!

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,620
Y'know WordPress is a community project, too, so people need...

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,420
The people who work on WordPress are volunteers, primarily

51
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,640
in their spare time.

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
But, some of them also work for the company behind WordPress.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,040
And so I think... the very best WordPress developers  in the world

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,440
get the opportunity to work, full-time, as their paid job on WordPress.

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
You have to start somewhere,

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,980
you don't just get a job in free software from nowhere, but you can uh...

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
If you already have a job writing programming, doing programming stuff

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
you probably already use some free software tools.

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,640
See if you can convince your boss

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,320
to allow you to release your changes

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
out to the world. And if you can, then

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,420
find the right community and give them the changes back

63
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
and you could very soon find yourself doing that for a living.

64
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,960
[Sean] How does it work in terms of

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,360
organizing teams of developers to kind of maintain free software.

66
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,660
[Matt] The way it really works is that, um...

67
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,740
If you are a developer and you enjoy a piece of software,

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,220
you can be part of its upkeep.

69
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,160
So, generally speaking, most software that's free software

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,780
is developed in public, using sites like Sourceforge historically

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,480
or nowadays in things like Gitorious or Github.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,420
You can go along, get a copy of the code,

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,940
find bugs, fix bugs, add new features

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
and kind of push that code, that you've made,

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
back to the main development team.

76
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,460
In general, what happens is there's kind of a process whereby

77
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,340
You send in a few bugfixes,

78
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,540
a few, like, suggestions

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,940
and then eventually, after a while,

80
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,760
they get kinda like, "This guy's okay

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,620
we'll let him into the team."

82
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,920
And then, you become part of that development team.

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,520
If they use Git, for example,

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
go and check out a copy of the Git code

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,340
and, make your changes locally,

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
but also, as you make your changes, check those changes into Git.

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
So that you have your own version of that code locally

88
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,720
You can kind of back-and-forth through it

89
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,560
and kinda see what you did along the way.

90
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,020
And when you makes commits to that good Git project

91
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,400
make good comments, so you kind of remember what you did.

92
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,540
Don't just leave a one-line, sarcastic response, which is what I often do.

93
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,060
Try and leave good comments

94
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
and that way you'll kind of be able to go back in time

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
and see what you did.

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,660
And then when ultimately,

97
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,240
when you eventually get those changes adopted by

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,080
the big community project,

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,860
they'll be able to see the same thing you can see

100
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,840
they'll be able to see what you did.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,600
And so, it's not so important to structure your code super-well

102
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,860
because, as long as you kind of make it work and you make good comments

103
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,740
then that can be cleaned up afterwards.

104
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,280
Look at companies like MySQL

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,980
and redhat, and they've made lots and lots of money from doing free software stuff.

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,380
So, you would definitely

107
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,380
[Sean] Canonical are one one of those are they as well?

108
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,720
[Matt] Canonical does have teams developing

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,360
certain pieces of free software.

110
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,180
I think the difference between Canonical and redhat is that

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,320
redhat develops software that's generally widely used

112
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,840
by all the free software users,

113
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,740
like Gnome Desktop and other things

114
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,060
whereas I think what Canonical does is a different model

115
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,200
and they actually develop kinda their own free software.

116
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,820
They release it as free software but it's mostly used for

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,260
the Ubuntu community and the Ubuntu users.

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,960
It's not so widely used outside of Ubuntu.

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
That's not an unreasonable thing

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,020
that's a, y'know, perfectly valid way to create software, y'know.

121
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,860
And, of course, there's nothing stopping

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
the teams at redhat and other companies and other organizations

123
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,480
from taking the Canonical code and reusing it for other things.

124
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,260
y'know, so...

125
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,560
If you are gonna

126
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,000
take code from other projects,

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,340
and you can of course do that,

128
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,020
then you make sure that the code you take is under a license that works

129
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,160
with the license of the project you're taking things into.

130
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,420
So, for example, if you're taking code from, um...

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,620
WordPress, you can't really take that code and put into a project that not under the GPL.

132
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,320
You would have a hard time wrangling that

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,660
and you would have an even harder time getting your changes

134
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
taken in by another project

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
because that file would then be under

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,780
at least partially under the GPL.

137
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,860
You should never let that kind of thing

138
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,540
dissuade you from taking stuff,

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,940
because it's free software, it's there to be taken

140
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
but, at the same time, you should just know the obligations

141
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,720
that you then have, um, as a developer

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,460
to kind of make your changes available to people.

143
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,220
So that, y'know, when you take your widget

144
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,900
from something that's GPL

145
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,400
and you put it on the web,

146
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,840
you then have to make sure that people can get the source code

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
to your changes, too; you can't just uh...

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,200
[Sean] Is that the share-alike sign?

149
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,360
[Matt] That's the share-alike part of things, exactly, yeah.

150
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,980
So if you have companies that for some reason don't want to use free software,

151
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,720
well then, take advantage of them

152
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,360
and sell them a copy for 2,000 dollars or 10,000 dollars

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
whatever you can get,

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,380
but, the same product should be free software at the same time

155
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,060
for those of us who are in the community that want

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
to take it and improve it and share it.
