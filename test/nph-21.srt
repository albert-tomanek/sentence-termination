1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,020
We plan to put a lot of other JANET core equipment so as you can imagine

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,800
JANET supports research and education. A lot of students are using the network, not only for their studies

3
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:19,780
but, they live in halls of residence so
we move a lot of Netflix traffic around the network

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:26,660
so we'll be putting some netflix caches that help to manage that traffic more efficiently on the network.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,560
[Are there any other services like Netflix that you'll be doing that for? Like Google or anything like that?]

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:41,080
We have direct pairings with Google and
Amazon to manage their traffic directly on the network.

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,420
[So if anyone's watching Amazon Prime video it's the same sort of thing]

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,030
it is yes, that'll go across JANET directly into the Amazon network

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,030
[So how much spare capacity is there here?]

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,290
We've got Terabits essentially of spare capacity

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,350
in the current system.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,360
This is where the JANET network enters the datacenter

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:17,800
The datacenter is actually on the core of the JANET network so we have diverse fibre, going out to two of our...

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,760
core points of presence one in East London, in Docklands, and one in West London

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,060
and that's how it connects to the JANET
network so we have our optical equipment

16
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,730
lighting that fiber. Which is Cienna optical equipment so at the moment we've got two 200 gig

17
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,910
wavelengths and we're about to add a second set of a hundred Gig wavelengths as well

18
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,510
and then we have the Juniper routing equipment

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,100
[If we were to look in the hole, where the cables come from all the universities what would we see?]

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,710
Well it's not that exciting its basically a pair of fibers in one side of the building and

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,479
then another pair of fibers coming to
the other side of the building and as I

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,850
say those fibers go to a location in
East London and then a location in West London.

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,220
[and then they go into here and get distributed amongst all your...]

24
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,030
That's right, they go into the optical equipment and then into the IP switching equipment

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:35,550
and we either present one Gig connections or 10 Gig connections to each of the customers.

26
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,100
The two fibers come in. They first of all come in

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,629
to the the optical equipment and that
does the de-multiplexing out of the light

28
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:53,340
signal and then that gets put into the
switching and routing equipment to which

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,720
each of the customers in the datacenter
connect so we have; out of the routing

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,080
equipment individual pairs of fiber that go into either data hall one or data hall two.

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:13,080
It's fibre coming out of the
equipment and that goes to the the in-datacenter patching

32
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,760
Infrastructure. So the Ciena equipment there, that, on a single fiber

33
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:26,359
is essentially capable of carrying
8.8 Terabits of information. At the moment as

34
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:34,459
we're growing into the datacenter we've got two hundred Gigabits, soon to move up to four hundred Gigabits.

35
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
This is the core equipment that powers the JANET network

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:45,850
so we have a national core that extends from Exeter in the south-west to Edinburgh &

37
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,580
Glasgow in Scotland we have about six
and a half thousand kilometers of fiber

38
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,110
that connects all that core equipment - and that core connects to 17 regional

39
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,770
distribution networks that then connects to the universities and colleges and the public

40
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,050
research institutions

41
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,990
so the signals come in to the optical
equipment, the Ciena equipment and then get

42
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,400
patched into the Juniper IP
switching and routing equipment in this

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:25,410
rack here. This is taking the signal out of the optical equipment converting that light

44
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:35,060
into the Internet protocol signal and then
customers connect out on individual ports

45
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:43,490
signals come out of that Juniper IP equipment. Come in via the fiber patching, into

46
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:52,280
this patching rack and then that'll go off into the wiring infrastructure on this yellow overhead trunking. So we

47
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:04,200
connect two ways out into the data hall so it's fully resilient so it'll come out into two

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,300
of the overhead raceways, and then be diversely

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,140
routed - take different routes
into the data hall that it's going into.

50
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:22,260
So if one of these overhead raceways were to be damaged, the other raceway would carry the signal.

51
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:31,200
[Have you had anything like that happen yet?] No we haven't, no not in the data centre. [and how long's this been in force, this system?]

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:41,060
It's nearly a year now it's been up and running. [and have you seen major differences using this system than before, how you had it before?]

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,820
Well this is our first data centre on the network so this is the first time we've done this!

54
00:05:48,560 --> 00:06:05,389
reader rather than just a traditional
fingerprint reader actually searching

55
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,020
for signs of life so as to make sure
that you have enough in your car from

56
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,360
someone who gets to use the power and
when that is a very important component

57
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,389
in the great which is what we call them
even wear
