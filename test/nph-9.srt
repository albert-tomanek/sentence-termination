1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the old days air traffic control was .. didn't really exist as such.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,800
An airplane wanting to fly from one place to another

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,250
would just take off and would try to

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,660
work out how to get to wherever it was going.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,730
Over time it was realized that we

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,320
needed some form of air traffic control

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,880
in order to more or less to avoid

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,350
airplanes from banging into one another,

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,210
but also to provide them with a service

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,070
so they actually would know what the

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,960
conditions were enroute and so on and so forth.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,820
So during the fifties and sixties

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,619
what evolved was the idea of an air

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
traffic control center where once the

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,210
airplane was away from the environment

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,219
of the airfield we now had a control

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,500
center which would then manage the

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,850
aircraft through what's called the

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,100
Airways system. And the airways is up at

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
high-level, it's once you've got

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,090
away from the airport then you're into

22
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,860
the airways system. The next problem was

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,180
how do we actually make all that work.

24
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,399
Now, in the old days you'd literally have

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,079
had a controller in sitting in front of the

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,239
radar and assistants running around with

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,500
flight strips taking them from one

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,690
controller to the other, and that clearly

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,489
wasn't going to work in the longer term.

30
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,199
Essentially a flight strip, when a

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,539
commercial flight flies it files

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,280
what's called a flight plan and the

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,170
flight plan says what the the flight

34
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,400
intends to do.

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
Where its going from, where its going to.

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,260
What its routing is, what type of aircraft

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,119
it is and so on and so forth. Quite a a lot of

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,159
information and essentially that ends up

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,170
becoming a flight strip which follows

40
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,540
that flight around. By the mid to late

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,130
60s we started to try to introduce

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,830
computers into this, effectively to

43
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,229
coordinate the movement of air traffic and

44
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,630
particularly to ensure that the controller

45
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
had the information that he required, but

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
also that the hand over between

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,470
controllers, as the flights progressed,

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,390
was done in a structured kind of fashion.

49
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,460
By the time we get down to nineteen seventy

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,470
we actually have a control room that's

51
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,329
at west drayton and what that was doing

52
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,310
was providing control for everything in

53
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,110
the airways system from the south coast

54
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,030
right the way up to the Scottish border.

55
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,829
There's an equivalent one at prestwick

56
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,990
which does Scotland and then basically

57
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,490
pushes the aircraft out across the

58
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,250
Atlantic. Each one of these hoods here is

59
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,460
effectively a radar sector an area of

60
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,710
airspace which is controlled by that

61
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,119
controller. So what you've got here is a

62
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,280
couple of controllers, the director who

63
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,649
is overall in charge of that sector and

64
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,060
effectively what's happening is as the

65
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,350
flight progresses it

66
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,120
moves from sector to sector until

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,830
eventually disappears outside of the

68
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,360
British air control controlled airspace.

69
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,970
One of the early attempts was to put in

70
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,950
a computer called the myriad, this is

71
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,390
around the late sixties into about

72
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,250
nineteen seventies. It takes a long time

73
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,410
to develop this sort of software and by the time

74
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,270
the software had actually been developed so

75
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,820
reasonably, so it was in reasonably working condition

76
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,470
air traffic had increased to such an extent

77
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,420
that the myriad was no longer capable of

78
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,670
doing the job. In fact it wasn't capable

79
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,080
of even doing the civil job. It was

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,610
originally designed to do civil and

81
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,840
military. It was designed for

82
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,580
fault-tolerant environments so it was a

83
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,710
triplex system. Three computer systems

84
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,630
effective they're all three computer

85
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,640
systems were doing the same job and what

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,170
would happen is that an arbitrator would

87
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,840
decide who got the right answer.

88
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,430
Hopefully all three got the same answer

89
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,230
but if they didn't then it would decide

90
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,970
which was most likely answer and

91
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,380
basically two out of three was the

92
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,600
arrangement. We were continually chasing

93
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,860
up against the limitations of what the

94
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,140
computer systems could do. The next

95
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,790
attempt was really when it all started

96
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,160
working which was in 1972 or

97
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,280
thereabouts-- the Board of Trade as it was

98
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,100
then decided that it was going to go out

99
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,340
and procure the 53rd, i think it was, air

100
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,720
traffic control systems from the United

101
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,030
States because they already had this

102
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
sectorised control system using big IBM

103
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,640
mainframe computers. The IBM 360 is the

104
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,380
underlying machine behind this.

105
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,140
10 million pounds of equipment in 1972 ish

106
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,480
there abouts for the first time we now

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,220
have enough processing power - more or less

108
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,930
to be able to do the job completely.

109
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,880
What's being pictured here is some of the

110
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,580
initial testing that's being done before

111
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,560
the system went operational. Testing all

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,210
of the various different conditions and making

113
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,340
sure that if we did nasty things to

114
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,330
a bit over here

115
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,860
a bit over there, they didn't fall over.

116
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
That's actually me running with one of

117
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,210
the tests sometime in 1974 it would be.

118
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,560
I'd come back from the United States

119
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,300
where I went to the training course at

120
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,000
the end of 73, by 1974 i was in there

121
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,220
I was a bit younger and thinner in those days.

122
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,420
Sean> What did it feel like going over to the

123
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,460
States and learning that, was that a new thing for you?

124
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,650
It was an extraordinary thing, i was twenty

125
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,390
barely twenty-two when I went out to

126
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,850
states and and I was basically a happy

127
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,140
technician. It was like all my christmasses

128
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,120
come at once. As a youngster who was

129
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,160
interested in technology to have a 10

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
million pound computer at my disposal

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
was just just extraordinary.

132
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,780
We were actually encouraged

133
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,310
to, particularly when we were on the training

134
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,900
course, we were encouraged to write software.

135
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,880
So i decided one of the things that I

136
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,350
decide that try and do is to write a

137
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,090
game where the computer played Monopoly

138
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,400
and you can see here the high-speed

139
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,410
printers these printers would run at six

140
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,850
hundred lines per minute. And i wrote

141
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,110
this whole thing in assembler the

142
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,150
computer would make a move and it would

143
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,460
then print the Monopoly board. So this

144
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,800
thing was throwing up pages like mad and

145
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,990
as the game progressed so the computer

146
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,910
had to do more and more work and so everything

147
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,860
got slower and slower. So it wasn't quite

148
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,480
throwing the pages at the same sort of speed.

149
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,830
Everything was paper-based. This was

150
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,480
before the days of VDUs, we didn't

151
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,100
have VDUs and things like that. This is

152
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,810
the system control here. The system

153
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,060
control is effectively the center

154
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,950
of gravity of this entire system.

155
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,900
What we then have is three compute elements

156
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,440
which were IBM 360-65s, which in their day were

157
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,930
quite powerful computers. They had behind

158
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,860
them,

159
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,560
get this, three-and-a-half mega words

160
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,169
of memory, core memory, three-and-a-half

161
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,820
mega words.

162
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah they're 32-bit words. so what would

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,370
that be around about forty megabytes or

164
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,130
something of that order of RAM. And we

165
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,780
ran the whole of the national air

166
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,610
traffic service on that without any

167
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,870
problem. In fact we could run it on about

168
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,610
three of them. We had seven storage

169
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,370
elements and we could run with three, we

170
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,220
prefered to have four so each one was half

171
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,590
a mega word. Then behind there was three

172
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,930
input output controllers which were IBM

173
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,919
360-50s now the IOCE, input output

174
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,690
control element, was responsible for

175
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,280
talking to all the various different

176
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,750
pieces of equipment that are attached to

177
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,640
this. So we have flight strip printers,

178
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,310
radar systems, all sorts of things all

179
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,050
feeding information in or receiving

180
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,810
information out from the 90-20 and they

181
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,400
were managed by the input output

182
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,419
control elements which you can't see

183
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,979
they're just behind there. The system

184
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,450
actually worked for quite a long time in

185
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,720
fact it was in service as this system

186
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,130
itself right the way through til

187
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,990
1990 when it was replaced by

188
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,110
4381 computers, a quarter / a third the size

189
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,490
and something like 10 times more

190
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,620
powerful but essentially running exactly

191
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,110
the same software in emulation mode in "360

192
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,470
emulation mode." So this was still at west

193
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,449
drayton.

194
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,610
And really that was mostly done because

195
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,409
this was quite old equipment even when

196
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,439
it was first put in and so it was

197
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,360
becoming too expensive to maintain. The

198
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,889
skills and knowledge necessary to

199
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,509
maintain it were effectively becoming

200
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,300
difficult to find now. So that was the

201
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,800
reason that was done and that kept

202
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,819
things going right the way through

203
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,039
really until the early two thousands

204
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,139
when it became apparent that really what

205
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,789
was happening now was that computing was

206
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,650
moving away from the large mainframe

207
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,849
environment to much more distributed

208
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,099
architecture. By now we have networking,

209
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,349
we have the ability to have mini and

210
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:01,699
micro computers which is where they

211
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,589
where we want them rather than having in

212
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,520
them in a major computer suite. So really

213
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
the west drayton environment wasn't

214
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,909
designed for that, it was designed with

215
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,919
the idea of having central processing

216
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,810
bays and lots and lots and lots of

217
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,759
cables running underneath ducts under

218
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,979
the floor to where they're going to be

219
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,930
used. In addition the RAF who actually

220
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,580
owned the west drayton site they kind of

221
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,710
wanted it back so there's lots of

222
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,120
reasons why eventually in the early

223
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,069
2000s we started looking at the idea of

224
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,899
moving to a new control center. This is

225
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,460
swanwick and effectively that

226
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,259
completely replaced the west drayton

227
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:33,919
setup.

228
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,810
Interestingly however, some of the code

229
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,189
which was written way up here back in

230
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,990
the nineteen seventies is actually still

231
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,240
in use to this day down here. A friend

232
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,219
of mine who worked together with me on a

233
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,839
lot of this software, going back to the

234
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,669
early seventies, he said "hey you know I

235
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:48,439
was I was kicking around in some code

236
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,209
the other day, just looking at it" and he says "and I

237
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,949
came across your initials against a line

238
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,439
of code," he says, "I thought about you." So

239
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,839
the thing is if this software still

240
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,009
works it ain't broke

241
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,110
so why fix it. The problem of air

242
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,089
traffic control is continually evolving

243
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,580
but the core functions are exactly the

244
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,180
same.

245
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,830
It takes a long time to get it all debugged,

246
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,139
so we might as well keep with the code

247
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,180
that we've already got. However over time

248
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,339
eventually that code will be replaced

249
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,520
but it's it's a slower process. This was

250
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,469
a major exercise getting this to work in

251
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,839
the in the 70s so they've really

252
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,029
sweating the assets and

253
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,259
taking advantage of the fact that its extremely

254
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,880
reliable code.

255
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,340
We'd like to thank Audible for supporting

256
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,000
computerphile and if you go to

257
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,370
audible.com/computerphile there's a

258
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,200
chance to sign up for a 30-day free

259
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,169
trial and download a free audio book. The

260
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,240
book I'd like to recommend is

261
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,210
Ernest Cline's Ready Player One. I enjoyed it so

262
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,100
much I went off and downloaded his other

263
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,200
book Armada as well, but ready

264
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,850
player one is well worth checking out if

265
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,890
you love the idea of a seamless VR

266
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,130
system, dystopian future, lots of eighties

267
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,140
pop culture references. I know a lot of

268
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,460
people have been recommending ready

269
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,900
player one. Its currently being made into

270
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,000
a film so check it out and thanks once

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,470
again to audible for supporting the

272
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,900
computerphile channel. The other two

273
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,300
canisters are actually butane cylinders

274
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,730
which were discarded and they act kind

275
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,950
of like a gas capacitor. They are called

276
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,580
accumulators and they store gas close to

277
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,050
where it comes out so that it can come

278
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,500
out quickly
