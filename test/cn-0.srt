1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
This is the Technical Difficulties

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,130
and we are playing
Two Of These People Are Lying

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,710
because two of these people will be.

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,130
Joining me are Chris Joel, Gary Brannan--

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,900
He said, "Why do you blow that bugle?"

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,406
And I said, "It don't
work if you suck it."

7
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:13,270
And Matt Gray.

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,890
The way the game works is,

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,560
the three of us have all picked
an article from Wikipedia

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,580
and written it down on
these pieces of card.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,450
Tom is now going to pick
one of the pieces of card

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,770
and one of us will be telling the truth

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,120
about what the article is
and two of us will be lying.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,140
And today we are talking
about... Evangelina Psarra?

15
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:37,340
"Psarra?" Psarra.
Egangelina Psarra.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,346
Gary, we're going to
start with you this time.

17
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,800
Evangelina Psarra.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,090
Is a musician in the field of sonic art.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,610
Sonic art, is that...
Yeah.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,680
It's just a hedgehog, doing
really bad Mona Lisas.

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,773
Does she perform the ring cycle?

22
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,190
[all] Wheey!

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,870
I'll get me coat(!)

24
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,670
Chris, Evangelina Psarra.

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,590
It is a skin disorder.

26
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,423
- Oh!
- Oh.

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,550
I think we were all surprised by that.

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,730
- Matt...
- You would be!

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,010
Evangelina Psarra?

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,160
Is a Greek...

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,960
...archer.

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,420
Let's start with that Greek archer.

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,055
Okay...

34
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:18,920
Confidence!

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,620
Could you tell me some more about them?

36
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,200
She competed in the summer Olympics.

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,540
Many years in a row,

38
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,540
from 2000 until 20...
was it '16, the last one?

39
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,770
Those are both summer Olympic years.

40
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,620
In 2016, she was ranked 8th
in the women's something else.

41
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,400
You know, when someone says
a very qualified statement

42
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,015
about where you're ranked.

43
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:48,848
Oh, yes.

44
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:51,150
Like some brands do, we are
"the something most thing

45
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,960
- "of the something or other thingy."
- Yes.

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,510
It was the women's something or other.
So, it's the name of the event,

47
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,230
but to me it sounded like
one of those things like,

48
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,442
"I'm the best... in this little category".

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,300
It was women's singles, or whatever.
I don't know how arching works.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,803
- Arching?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:08,160
- Not archery, arching.
- Arching?

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,667
- Just very good at just arching.
- Just bend and a curve.

53
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:17,140
And then there was an entire paragraph
about her scores and how, I think,

54
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,187
that when she ranked 8th it was a 75 shot
to reach a score of 650.

55
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,910
Whatever that means.

56
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,440
I've never even watched any
professional archery but...

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,120
He's watched plenty of
unprofessional archery.

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,168
Just people getting
stabbed all over the place.

59
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,634
- It's just awful.
- Outside lane of the M1.

60
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,493
Out of the sunroof.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,913
Oh!

62
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:42,140
Well, it's like archery
jousting but on the M1.

63
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,547
Motorway jousting!

64
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:47,348
Like going 70 on the motorway.

65
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:50,220
You've got two cars and
two massive boxing gloves.

66
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,176
Yes!

67
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,470
So, I picked an article
that was about that long,

68
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,660
thinking, oh there will
be some meat to this.

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,900
I wrote it down on the piece
of paper and then a lot of it

70
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,364
is about her victories
and a lot of scoring and

71
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:02,040
what people from what countries
beat her in the Olympics.

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,150
Let's talk about sonic art then, Gary.

73
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,480
What sort of art is being produced here?

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,260
Obviously sonic, other than, with sound.

75
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Yes, yeah, well, some might call it music.

76
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,190
Others probably would not,
in that one of them was

77
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,680
burping into a length of drain pipe.

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,550
All right,

79
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,000
With a lot of reverb and
stuff around it and also a--

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
Do you feel you'd be able to give an
impression of what that might be like?

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,699
Bring me my drain pipe.

82
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,197
I haven't brought mine with me.

83
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,030
Can I just steal that?

84
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,797
- No.
- No?

85
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,913
Those are non-sonic art...

86
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,022
Maybe just resonant like that.

87
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:39,000
[loud burping]

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,770
I mean, now I have to give her royalties.

89
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
PRS on this!

90
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,990
Yeah, so that and stuff like
music that's pitched outside

91
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,840
the range of human hearing.
That kind of thing.

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,310
Ah, dog discomfort music.

93
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,195
- Basically yes so you--
- Ah, DDM!

94
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,880
You've got your EDM, you've got your DDM.
They're very different.

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,290
It's human discomfort,
and dog discomfort.

96
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,210
Apparently, she had very high,
she had a very wide

97
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,787
pitch of hearing and would go to other,

98
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:10,700
there was a thing in the article saying she
goes to other artists' performances,

99
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,080
likewise, at pitches outside the
range of human hearing

100
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
and she'd critique them
on their performance

101
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,890
because she could hear the edits.

102
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,510
Now, up until that very last bit,
I was with you Gary.

103
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,343
Right?

104
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:24,680
But, the audio engineer in here
and the person who edits video in here,

105
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,760
both kind of went: "you what?"

106
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,110
Well, don't take it up with me,
take it up with her.

107
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,380
- Chris.
- Yes.

108
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,213
A skin disorder.

109
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:35,801
A skin disorder and, for double points,

110
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,843
a notable example of selection bias.

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,713
Go on.

112
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:45,833
Evangelina Psarra, Evangelina,
to do with evangelism.

113
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,340
Originally, when described, thought to
afflict only the religious community.

114
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,020
- Well.
- Ooh.

115
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,340
Selection bias, because
they were the sort of people

116
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,840
that you could go in
and study and describe.

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,480
Where as, everybody else
who was wondering around

118
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,930
with this, well, not horrendous disease
but unpleasant disease,

119
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,720
was going, sort of... "uninspected"
isn't the word I'm looking for.

120
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,260
Isn't receiving the
appropriate attention from

121
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,210
the medical community of the time.

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,350
So, it gets described as
this thing that specifically

123
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,150
affects enclosed, religious communities.
Which is, of course, nonsense.

124
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,500
It is a boring, normal skin disorder
but once you've described something,

125
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,120
in science, it retains the name.

126
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,470
Oh, Chris, that is excellent.

127
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,763
That is either the best line of utter bollocks
we've ever done in this format...

128
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:35,620
Or, a very accurate description
of having utter bollocks

129
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,020
in the religious community.

130
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,148
Evangelina Psarra, if it turns out that this
is an archer, or a sonic artist,

131
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,932
that's just an awful thing to
do to their name.

132
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,339
God I hope, I hope it's a Sonic artist.

133
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,490
I really do.

134
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,098
- Yeah, so do I.
- So do I.

135
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:54,410
And that was either a
really good double bluff

136
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,460
or accidentally giving it up.
I don't know.

137
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,960
I don't, ah, all right.

138
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,048
Gary, I'm going to rule you out
because I don't think

139
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:06,290
dog discomfort music
is going to be a thing.

140
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,850
I think you accidentally
went into a bit of knowledge

141
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,570
that I have about finding
the edits and I don't think

142
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,760
high frequencies would change that.
So, Gary, I don't think it's you.

143
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,210
Obviously the correct thing
for me to do here is say,

144
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,630
Matt, it's a dull article about an archer

145
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,280
who's been in few Olympics, because,
obviously, that's a name.

146
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,243
Because, obviously, that's all true.

147
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,763
But.

148
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,210
Chris, no I...
Chris, I think it's you, am I right?

149
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,870
No, it's definitely an archer.

150
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,790
Aw!

151
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,840
What with all the real facts.

152
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,700
Is it the archer?

153
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,855
- Yeah.
- Oh!

154
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,647
I was hoping, I was really hoping.

155
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:51,480
Can I make a point this way?

156
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,583
You that bit about someone who can hear
the high pitch and the edits?

157
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,540
That person does exist.

158
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,118
I know them, they are a
person who does sonic art.

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,970
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,290
How can... why does being
able to hear the high noises

161
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,970
change your ability to hear any edits?

162
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,430
Because, the piece has been
put together from separate

163
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,280
parts of high frequency noise and,
because it's high frequency noise,

164
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,120
there's clunky edits in it
all the way through.

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,210
This is in the days when you were doing it

166
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,660
with actual tape rather
that waveforms or anything,

167
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,340
Oh, so, you just hear the joins.

168
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:22,910
Came up at the end to say, "it's nice
but I can hear all the edits".

169
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,580
If everyone else can't hear it at all then

170
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,230
the person who can hear it
can hear the edits.

171
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,063
All right.

172
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,510
So you, sir, technically wrong twice.

173
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,411
Which kind of makes up
for the last episode.

174
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,883
Matt has gone and got himself
a new article.

175
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:38,340
If your wondering why Gary's eyes are
suddenly bloodshot and he's teared up,

176
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,820
that's because you missed a
five minute giggle loop

177
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,060
based around a toilet version
of British game show Bob's Full House.

178
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,300
- Which--
- Which is still not safe.

179
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,923
No, it's still not safe.

180
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,420
Bob's Full Bogs.

181
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,160
That's a better joke.

182
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,535
That's, yeah, oh, no,
it's just a series of doors!

183
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,917
"So, it's going to be, it's going to be
the third door from the left, it's..."

184
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,380
There's a ker-splash of water
from underneath it.

185
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,220
You've been wallied.

186
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,680
It was Russ Abbot.

187
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,940
All you can see of the
celebrities are just their shoes

188
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,820
and their rolled down trousers.

189
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,320
- He's not even a real Abbot.
- Let's, let's...

190
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,260
You okay, Gary?

191
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,880
(I can just see it...!)

192
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,440
When they've got the big board at the end,

193
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,560
it's just three racks of
toilet cubicles, like,

194
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,740
Celebrity Squares-style,
and they just hold up the, er...

195
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,920
trouble is, of course, because it's
Celebrity Squares-style

196
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
there isn't actually any plumbing
and it's just, kind of, open to...

197
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,472
Audience.

198
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,574
(You sound like a choking dog.)

199
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,267
In this episode, Gary
will be replaced by--

200
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:04,705
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

201
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:07,508
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

202
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,460
I hoped you haven't pissed yourself.
These seats aren't wipe clean.

203
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,948
It's fine, it just goes down over
whoever's in the row below.

204
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,108
I can't...

205
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:41,140
You've gone the same
colour as Tom's t-shirt.

206
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,973
Come on.

207
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,890
Oh, come on.

208
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,763
It's when they've got the Krankies, both in
the same cubicle, it all falls apart.

209
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,574
Keith Harris and Orville...

210
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,211
"I can't go in public!"
"You can!"

211
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,790
Would you like a tissue?

212
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,183
Could I? Thank you.

213
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,610
F***.

214
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,070
We are...
no, he's gone again.

215
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,950
Come on, behave.

216
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,242
We are talking about the Green Monster.

217
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,660
The Green Monster.

218
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,700
Gary, I'll give you a minute
to compose yourself this time.

219
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,030
- Thank you.
- Chris, the Green Monster.

220
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,600
Is a land speed record car.

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,384
- Ooh.
- Yes.

222
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,038
Now, did it ever get the record?

223
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,320
Actually I'll come back
to you in a minute.

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,153
All right then.

225
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,030
Land speed record car.

226
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,863
Gary.
Yes?

227
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:52,740
And I ask this tentatively,
the Green Monster?

228
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,090
It was a 19th century rail engine
on the East Coast Main Line.

229
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,853
On the ECML.
All right, and Matt, the Green Monster?

230
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,310
- It's a brand of absinthe.
- Okay.

231
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,230
We'll start with the absinthe then.

232
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,742
We'll not get to the end if we do!

233
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,540
What is special about the Green Monster?

234
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,300
'Cause I've heard of the Green Fairy
but I've not heard of the Green Monster.

235
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,930
It's much bigger.

236
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,950
Is it just someone's poured some absinthe
into some Monster energy drink?

237
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,931
Ah, that would be one hell of a cocktail
and you would not sleep for weeks.

238
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,864
Spiritus sancti...

239
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,960
It's one of those articles, I've forgotten the
phrase they put on Wikipedia,

240
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,980
the bit on the top that says "this looks
more like a sales pitch than an article".

241
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,780
Oh, yes. Clearly, the
PR company has been involved.

242
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,004
It's a load of PR w***
saying "our wormwood is the--"

243
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:37,837
Wormiest.

244
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:39,969
Specially grown, wormiest, strongest--

245
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:40,802
Woodiest.

246
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:43,240
It occurs to me that I don't
know what wormwood is.

247
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,740
- I don't either.
- It's a herb. I think.

248
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,120
Is it a root or a bark or something?

249
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,940
Sort of sounds like it ought,
to be a root doesn't it?

250
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,230
It's MDA, it has
hallucinogenic properties.

251
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,620
It's biblic... it's mentioned
in the bible, as well, is wormwood.

252
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,220
- There's a bit...
- I've just realised,

253
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,790
Gary's not making this up,
because it's not his article.

254
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,923
No, no!

255
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:04,770
And lo, the Lord did take
three fingers of the green

256
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,585
and f*** me, the bush was on fire!

257
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,460
It's well known cause Reagan
quoted it after chapter--

258
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,293
What, in the bible?

259
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,650
I think even in the Tea Party's
most conservative dreams,

260
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,162
- Reagan is not in the bible.
- No, but he was in the film.

261
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,370
- What, of the bible?
- Yes, a film of the bible.

262
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,750
All right, so brand of
absinthe with a higher ABV

263
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,144
and a lot of PR guff about it.

264
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:25,977
Yeah.

265
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,500
All right, Gary, it's a
19th century railway engine

266
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,560
on the East Coast Main Line.

267
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,703
Now... you okay there?

268
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,410
What's... oh!
It's the toilet-based Bob's Full House.

269
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,650
It was called, in our little reverie just then,
"Bob's Full Bogs".

270
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,279
And not "Bog's Full House",
which it really should have been!

271
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,266
Yeah, but Bob would never allow it
to not have his name in it, would he?

272
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,250
That's true, that's true.

273
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,853
- Anyway, so it's--
- "Bog Outhouse."

274
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:58,040
Wooh, anyway, so the rail engine is
the Stirling Single, which is in

275
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,990
the National Railway Museum.
I believe. Or one of 'em.

276
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,400
It's the one that you look at,
it is green and--

277
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,397
Well, it would be.

278
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:10,046
But it's got a big wheel in the middle.
So, rather than have, its driving wheel--

279
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,420
That's not where you
normally put wheels on.

280
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,253
There normally on the--

281
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:14,665
- Well, it's on the outside.
- The outside.

282
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,043
Lengthwise, mate.

283
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:16,876
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,430
You mean, like, steering wheel?
Cause that's not how trains work.

285
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,480
No, I mean the big one
that goes round and round

286
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,281
- with the pumpy things on it.
- Oh, my.

287
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:27,730
So the driving wheel is a big central wheel.
About 11 foot.

288
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,808
I don't know how steam trains work.

289
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,533
F***in' Jesus!

290
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,100
Steam makes thing go like that.
It's connected to a wheel that goes like that.

291
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,560
Right, so, to try and get more traction,

292
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
'cause the whole thing is getting up
to a higher speed.

293
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,050
Which is what you're looking for.

294
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,350
The driving wheel was a big middle wheel,
about 11 foot high.

295
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,260
Right. Okay.

296
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,201
It was quite fast and it was pretty smooth
and it actually did quite well.

297
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:53,285
It was one of the first big successful
high-speed, long-distance engines.

298
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,310
Was it the penny-farthing of trains?

299
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,630
Pretty much.

300
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,390
Only it hasn't got a Victorian
gent wobbling atop it.

301
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,580
Well, it probably did, actually.

302
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,510
Not wobbling though.

303
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,590
Oh, yeah, no just stood resolutely.

304
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,790
All right, sorry mate.

305
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,230
- Not like, "whoa...!"
- "Oh! Bloody hell!"

306
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,620
It was known as the Green Monster,

307
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,680
it was big, it was fast,
it made a lot of noise

308
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,922
and, you know, you got flames
and smoke coming out of it.

309
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,120
All right.

310
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,950
Chris, the Green Monster,
the land speed record car.

311
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,300
Green Monster is a land speed
record car built somewhere in America

312
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,800
by a guy called Art Arfons.

313
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,398
It was one of the first jet cars...

314
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:30,895
Sorry, that's just the
Yorkshire version of Happy Days.

315
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,480
Our Fonz!

316
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
It's our Fonz, that!

317
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,543
Ey! Sit on it.

318
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,300
- Art Arfons.
- Art Arfons.

319
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,500
What else have I told you?

320
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,330
It's the land speed record,
it was built in America,

321
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,770
by Art Arfons sometime in the early 60's.

322
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,170
Held the record three times

323
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,460
and was eventually beaten by somebody else.

324
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,610
- That's fine.
- And it wasn't green.

325
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,276
- It wasn't green?
- It was red and blue.

326
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,073
Do we know why or was
that just because America?

327
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:00,990
Because it was red and blue,
'cause the article said

328
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,013
it wasn't green, it was red and blue.

329
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,300
This is genuinely difficult.

330
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,620
You say this almost every time.

331
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:11,390
No, no, 'cause last time,
last time it was like, I mean...

332
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,200
I've been getting it right.

333
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,595
Earlier one it was like,
it should be Matt, it should be Matt.

334
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm going to go with Chris on the guess.

335
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,720
But, in this case, I have,
genuinely, no idea.

336
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,440
Gary, I think that's
just a different train

337
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,950
that you've applied the
name Green Monster to.

338
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,720
I don't think it's Mallard,
but it's something like that

339
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,050
'cause you know your railway history.
I think you've just gone Green Monster,

340
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,350
so I don't think it's you.

341
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,063
Matt,

342
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,530
I'm tempted by that

343
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,090
but the thing that's convinced me, Chris,
is Art Arfons.

344
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,730
Which feels like a name you
wouldn't pull from somewhere.

345
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,130
You'd have to pull it from
a very specific place.

346
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,820
Yes, it would have to be someone else.

347
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,313
So, Chris, I think it's the speed record car.
Am I right?

348
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,363
- You are absolutely right.
- Yes!

349
00:15:55,363 --> 00:16:00,900
Built 1960-61 after he broke up,
after the speed racing partnership

350
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,500
broke up with his brother, had a J79
out of an F104 taken from a junkyard.

351
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,280
Got hold of the manuals, despite the
government intervening and saying

352
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,700
"that is still classified,
you can't have it,"

353
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,230
balanced the engine not by getting
spare parts but by pulling parts out of it,

354
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,830
tested it by strapping
it to trees in his yard,

355
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,170
strapped it into a car and, eventually,

356
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,720
did 594 miles an hour.

357
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,395
- Good God!
- Two ways in 1964.

358
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:27,710
- S***.
- Good heavens!

359
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,830
And I only had to faintly check
the article on that one. Funnily enough!

360
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,710
Chris, congratulations,
that's a point to you.

361
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,376
That's two points to you, isn't it?
You got a point for the other one as well.

362
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,757
- Suck it!
- You win! Like it matters!

363
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,303
It doesn't matter that I win,
it matters that you lost.

364
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,017
Well, that where we're cutting that.
