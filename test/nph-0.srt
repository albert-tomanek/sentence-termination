1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,580
Some of us would really like to move towards where we have a lot of these

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,620
moving in parallel and indeed IBM...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,080
quite some time ago, 15 years ago

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,260
had something called the millipede

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,720
where they had lots of little sensors moving across the surface

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,720
and actually instead of doing the individual atoms, they were looking at a plastic film

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,200
and they would push the sensors in and create a little hole

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,380
and then they were really clever so that was the write process

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
the delete or the erase process was

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,360
they put the probe in the hole, heat it up and then pull the probe out slowly.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,160
and what would happen was that the plastic would extrude and fill up the hole, so that they could delete it

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,200
so that was... Unfortunately, they discontinued that project

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
largely because flash memory came along

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
and sort of blew that out of the water

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
but it's a fascinating idea to think about,

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,320
could we actually push all those probes working together all the way down to the atomic level

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
>>It does feels a bit like the difference between writing something out by hand and using photocopy

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,380
yea

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
yea, I gue.. yea, exactly, yea

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not thinking about the actual mechanics of how the photocopier works

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,660
in terms of a very serial process where you're doing this

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,840
compared to just snapshot all in one go

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,180
that's a really good analogy

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,660
ok, go down the lab

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,940
Good!

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,200
The reason Philip's here is because of Brady's channels

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,780
'cause of Sixty Symbols, Philip left a job

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,160
in Brazil

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,960
So, Philip

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,760
Philip's gona be working not on silicon as we've been discussing.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
But actually on the other thing I've mentioned, which was gallium arsenide (GaAs)

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,180
the systems we use to manipulate atoms are these ones

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,720
actually, Alex over here is imaging individual molecules

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
each blob you can see on the screen

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,340
is an individual molecule on a surface

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,340
and it's scanning actually in real time at the moment

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
and behaving itself

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,520
pretty well

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
So, that's an island, you can see the edge on one side, see the coastline

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
that's the edge of the molecular island

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
and then it's on a metal surface

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,580
So on the left hand side you see the metal and on here you see the individual molecules.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,460
the greys are Carbon (C)

44
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,460
the reds are oxygen (O)

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
and the whites are hydrogen (H)

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,720
but that's sort of off the point of what we were discussing

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
It's just to show you in action that

48
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,580
we can, just as you're standing here, we're talking

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
you can see those individual molecules

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,220
It's all happening in here

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,920
this system is... Why we got all the stainless steel is

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
it's an ultra high vacuum system

53
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,180
the pressure in there is comparable to that you'd get on the moon

54
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,720
on the surface of the moon

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
or if you're on a good day, in space

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,180
a good day in space, or a good day here?

57
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,360
Either!

58
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,340
so the one question we're asked a lot

59
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,860
(I don't know if the Computerphile audience will be interested)

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,260
"why the heck have you got all the tinfoil everywhere?"

61
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,860
and it's not just because times are tough in terms of funding

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,880
it's because if we were just to pump this system and do nothing else

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
even with the best pumps in the world, it would sit there

64
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
and we would get reasonable pressures and vacuum

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,440
but we'd get nowhere close to 'in space'

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,820
pressures and type of vacuum we have in space

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,520
and the reason for that is every surface around is is covered in a thin film of water

68
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
and that water just sits there

69
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
and when we pump this down, we pollute the vacuum

70
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
so what we need to do is drive off that water

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,880
to drive of that water we bake, we literally bake the system

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,940
we put a big oven around it

73
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
just as we put tinfoil around a turkey

74
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,580
we put tinfoil around it, and we heat it up to 150Â°C

75
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,100
drive off all the water

76
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,080
cool it down

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,200
and then you get a good pressure

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I guess the poster right here, to finally get back to silicon

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
so each of these individual blobs

80
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,040
is a silicon atom

81
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,460
and so we can not only see those silicon atoms

82
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,420
by bringing a probe in above the silicon surface

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,400
and this is actually the lattice we saw upstairs

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,540
what we can do is, we can use the probe to manipulate the individual silicon atoms

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,960
and that's what's happening here

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,120
and in fact we got all the way down to 2 atoms

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
and making an electromechanical switch

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,260
from flipping those 2 atoms, and we did a SixtySymbols video on that

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh my dear 5 years ago, 2011

90
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,100
So, next step is going to be some kind of circuit than?

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
so that's very interesting

92
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,240
I must admit, we are driven not so much technology, and technological application

93
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,260
really not at all about technology and  application

94
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,580
what's driving us like, because we're physicists

95
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,420
is what are the fundamental forces between those atoms

96
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,900
how do we control the interactions

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,720
how do we control the bonding and change

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,740
what the electrons are doing at the surface

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,600
from a very "what are the fundamental limits of manipulating matter"

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,300
that's really what's driving us

101
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
rather than can we get a device out in 2 years

102
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
because a device is not coming out

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,080
well, we also operate at 5 degrees above absolute zero

104
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,540
there aren't so many devices that you want a helium cryostat beside it operating

105
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,400
and that's a fairly big operating cost

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
so, it's very fundamental science

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,220
>>That's gonna drain your iPhone battery, isn't it?

108
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,160
yea indeed
