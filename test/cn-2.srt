1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
This is The Technical Difficulties, and we are
playing Two of These People are Lying

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,680
because two of these people will be.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,080
-Chris Joel.
-Hello!

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,840
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,560
"Good pint o' gravy of an evening
sets you up for a night."

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,720
And Matt Gray.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,560
And seeing as I can't follow that up,
I'll just explain what's going on.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,360
The three of us have each looked up
a different Wikipedia article on our phones,

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,480
I like how you both drank
at the same time there.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
"Two bodies, one brain!"

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
We've written down the title of each article
on a piece of paper that's down there.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,280
Tom is going to pick one of those pieces
of paper

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
and try and guess which one of us
is telling the truth.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
The other two, as we haven't read the article,
are going to be talking s***.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
All I have to do is work out
which two of these people are lying

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,880
and we are talking about...

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
Johnstone's Robin.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,040
Johnstone's Robin or... I think that's Johnstone,
that's not "John Stone's". Johnstone's Robin.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,480
Gary, why don't you start this time?

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,320
Johnstone's Robin is named after a…

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,200
well, for want of a better word, a play?
A manoeuvre? In cricketing circles in the 1890s.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,960
It was done by Robin Jenkins who played
for Gloucestershire and it's a manoeuvre

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,200
where one fools the batting side
by pretending to make some kind of catch.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,880
So to put off a batsman,
you would do Johnstone's Robin,

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,560
which is a fake move in a cricket field.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,280
Just to be clear, you're saying that Johnstone's
Robin was named after... Robin?

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
Yes?

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
-Right, let me just say...
-F***ing burn!

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,080
that kind of s*** did you really well
first time, didn't it?

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,920
And second time.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
So you discount away 'cos both times
you've done that, ya been wrong.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,000
It's alright, Tom, he wasn't finished.

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,360
He was just starting.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
-Sorry.
-If you want me to carry on,

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,520
because the robin part is named
after the hopping manoeuvre that was involved.

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,080
You said it was named after Robin.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
Because it's a funny name
because you've got robin-bird

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,000
and Robin as a person,
people are trying to be funny.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,240
People are known to do that,
I mean look at us f***ers trying.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Do you want to run me through the causation?

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,320
The manoeuvre?

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,440
No, not manoeuvre,
just run me through what you said.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,400
-I can't remember.
-Okay.

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
Chris.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,400
I wasn't there, Your Honour.
You would have to consult my lawyer.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Yes.

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,760
Chris, Johnstone's Robin.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,840
Johnstone's Robin,
I'm afraid this is a stub

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,400
so you’re not going to get a lot,

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,120
is a trig point just north of Bamford in the
Hope Valley in the Peak District

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
210 metres on an unremarkable little knoll

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
as it rises up the valley side
to the actual high trig points along the top.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,800
So trig points, just for those who don't know,
they're navigation pillars.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah, so you put them on high places
so you can put your, what's it called?

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,920
Angle measuring device!

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,520
Angle measuring gubbins in it
and it lets you map out the local topography.

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,200
They're usually on very high places,
but sometimes to map out a lower area

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
it'll go on something lower,
and that's what Johnston…

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,240
well the little hillocl is Johnstone's Robin
but there's now a trig point

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,520
at 210-and-change meters.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,640
That is an entirely plausible Wikipedia stub.

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,400
Matt, Johnstone's Robin.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,280
It's a robin, a type of bird,
it lives in Taiwan

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,960
and for everything that I could see
in the article,

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,520
it's not actually named
after someone called Johnston,

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,600
I could find no evidence.

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,080
A lot of stuff gets named in honour,
doesn't it?

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Yes.

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,160
Because, like, there's butterflies called
"Attenboroughncii" and things like that.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,320
The article didn’t mention this.
It is called whatever the phrase...

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,600
It sounds like you've repeated the article
verbatim there,

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,120
like, "it's a f***ing robin".

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,720
Alright Wikipedia, alright.

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,600
Once again,
I can't remember the Latin word for robin

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,520
but it was Robin Johnstoniae.

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
Robinious.

77
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
I always love that there is a bird,

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,720
and I think it's the blackbird
is Turdus Turdus.

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
Yes, it is Turdus Turdus, yeah.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
S***ty S***ty.

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
I like that.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,320
Oh, that's a difficult choice,

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,240
I mean, I kind of just want to come back
to the cricket manoeuvre.

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Fair.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,120
Not because I think it's right,
I just want to hear you

86
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,960
continuing to try and lie about this.

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,160
Can I say, continue to try and lie on the
first one we did, which worked out grand.

88
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,920
-It did, it did.
-Yeah.

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,520
Can you describe the cricket manoeuvre?

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,960
Cricket manoeuvre,
obviously you have a bowler coming in

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,440
of which when it is now illegal, in the rules
of cricket, to do a deceptive manoeuvre.

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
You cannot pretend…

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,200
-Well, no, you cannot pretend to run…
-It's just not cricket.

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,080
It's not! You cannot pretend to run over here
when the ball is going over here,

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,520
okay, so you have to be honest in the field.

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,040
This was the start of that kind of,
for want of a name, horses****ery,

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
okay, when…

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
Gary Brannan stands for unfair cricket.

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
Well, it is…

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,440
No, no, no, distracting the batsman,

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
is horse s****ery, let's face it,
it's bulls***, you can't do that, right.

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,240
In this, the manoeuvre was someone would
perform a hopping manoeuvre deep in the field

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,880
to make someone go,
"F***? What is that?"

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
What, it's literally on one leg hopping?

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,960
Well, I... wa... the story
goes it was in the way

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,840
of tying a boot or something like that, like,
you know, you might pull one leg up

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
because your shoelace has come a bit loose,
try and tie it, hopping around,

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
dicking around in the field,
trying to distract the batsman,

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,520
therefore he gets halfway down his run,
looks over, realises...

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,160
-Oh, f***, he's on the ball, when it's actually over there.
-Yeah.

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,480
It's actually over there,
which has obviously gone quite short,

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,440
bails whipped off,
massive argument on field

113
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,080
and which leads to the point not long after
that doing a deceptive manoeuvre in the field

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,160
to distract a batsman while in play
is in fact illegal and not within the spirit

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
nor the laws of the game.

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
And is known as a Johnstone's Robin?

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
-Correct, as the hopping manoeuvre.

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,080
I admire how well you have pulled
that back from the edge.

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,520
Can I say, can we get those six eggs
from over there ready to slash them

120
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,080
on your face later on.

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm going to level with you, Gary,

122
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,200
if it turns out that this is true,
I feel like you, you deliberately…

123
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,480
I've got a frightful shade of déjà vu here.

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,920
I almost feel like you deliberately screwed up
the introduction

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,000
to say it was named after Robin.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Hmm, it's almost like a deceptive manoeuvre
someone would play in a game where

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
we're trying to disguise who may be lying.

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,960
What kind of man would do that, I ask you?

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,080
-I have another fact about the bird.
-Ooh.

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Shall I tell you the name of the person
who discovered it?

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
-Yes.
-William Robert Ogilvy Grant.

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
-Oh yes.
-That is a proper name.

133
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,200
There is no Johnstone in that at all,
yet it is still called Robinus Johnstonii.

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
Oh, Matt.

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Also, if a name was ever going to be real,
it'd be that one.

136
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
-Yeah.
-It's got some weight behind it.

137
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,920
That's either…

138
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,840
That's either a genuine name or it's just a
name that Matt has plucked from somewhere else.

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
That took a lot of plucking.

140
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,400
And so does a Johnstone's Robin.

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,720
-A normal robin size.
-Robin size!

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,640
Gary, I don't think it's you,

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,840
I think you're lying because
I just think there was too much…

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,760
-You've got an untrustworthy face.
-Too much messing about at the start,

145
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,160
-Chris.
-Hello.

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360
I think that's just literally somewhere you
know in…

147
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
was it Peak District or Lake?

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,160
Peak District.

149
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
I think that's literally just somewhere you
know in the Peak District

150
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
that you've given a different name to.

151
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,120
Matt, I believe you, am I right?

152
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,160
You think that William Robert Ogilvy Grant
is a real person?

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
-Yeah, go on.
-Yeah, you're right.

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Yes!

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
Hey!

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,400
That was a point to Matt
and finally a point to me.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
That won't stand.

158
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
The best thing is that I didn't use the exact
title of the article,

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,160
I used the bird's other name,
because I wanted to lead on to the fact

160
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
that it's also called the coloured bush robin.

161
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,760
But I couldn't remember what its funny name
was throughout the entirety of that,

162
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,080
because if I'd have said "bush robin", you'd have
gone straight over that side of the table.

163
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,340
-Alright, Matt...
-Only the truth hurts.

164
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,840
you should go and pick a new article,
we'll be back in a moment.

165
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,040
Right, Matt has gone and found a new article,
there are three still under here

166
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,280
and I am told that they have been written
in each other's handwriting now,

167
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,000
so I can't get any clues from that.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,760
So...

169
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun...

170
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,560
Ageratina Occidentalis, Agerantina,..

171
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,760
You know what, the first thing I'm going to do
is ask each of you to pronounce that,

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
-Chris.
-Agerantina Occidentalis.

173
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,440
Gary.

174
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Ageratina Occidentalis.

175
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Chris, what is... that?

176
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
You don't want it, let's put it that way.

177
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,240
Okay? How gauche should I be?

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,600
Gary.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,520
It was a form of ecclesiastical censure
pre-reformation.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm just throwing in long words in to see
if you can write them down.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,080
I know.

182
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,880
Pre-reformation, that seems to be very much in
your wheelhouse

183
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,080
but then you would have picked
something in your wheelhouse.

184
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,440
'Ecumenical matter...'

185
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Matt.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,260
It is a flowering plant
with triangular glandular leaves.

187
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,560
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
"Triangular glandular leaves."

189
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Matt.

190
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,120
Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.

191
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
Glandular?

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,640
If you had not said the word 'glandular',
that would have been entirely convincing.

193
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,080
We’ll come back to that.

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,680
Chris, why would I not want Agerantina…

195
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,120
-Ageratina… Ageratina actually.
-Occidental.

196
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,240
Ageratina Occi,
why would I not want that?

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,360
It is a minor bowel disorder with everything
that you imagine comes with that.

198
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,720
I say minor, but long term, it's not something
that goes away quickly,

200
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,600
caused by the accidental ingestion
of a bacteria that lives in soil

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,120
so it's accidental food contamination generally
in less developed nations.

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Right, that's entirely plausible and I can't
think of anything funny to say about that.

203
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,040
I love that he always comes to me
and I always get exactly the same line,

204
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,880
'That is entirely plausible.'

205
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,240
Gary, ecclesiastical censure pre-reformation,

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,160
how would the ecclesiastical be censured?

207
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Well, it's one step short
of the full excommunication.

208
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Can I ask a question quickly?

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
-Yeah.
-What was the second word after ecclesiastical?

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
-Censure.
-And what does that mean?

211
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,920
-That means telling someone off.
-Does it?

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,880
Yeah. You're told off in a serious
and formal and recorded fashion, so aye.

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,280
Yeah, you're right, well, of course I'm going
to pick an article that sits in my interest

214
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,800
so I can bloody well remember it,

215
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,280
as I did so well last time in remembering
the non-content of what I was talking about.

216
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,520
And also, yeah, it's one step short of the full
excommunication where you would,

217
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,280
bell, book and candle, and told to get out of life
basically and not come back.

218
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,560
So this is one which is, if you like,
the final warning in which people

219
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,520
will be forced to parade around the parish church
of where they live wearing only a sheet.

220
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Parade around the parish.

221
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Parade around the parish church wearing
naught but a sheet so everyone knew

222
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,200
they had been dead naughty and that.

223
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Like a ghost?

224
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,560
Well, you would look a bit like a ghost.

225
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,000
I thought you meant naughty like a ghost.

226
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
That's a song, isn't it?

227
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,880
"George, you stand charged of drifting into
Mrs Mason's bathroom."

228
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,520
"Yes, your honour, I... 'drifted'. Mmm."

229
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,320
"Generally hanging around under a sheet."
Yeah, yeah, so yeah, no.

230
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,080
That’s what Ageratina Occidentalis is
and the Occidentalis relates

231
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,520
to the direction one would have to move
around the church.

232
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
-Which direction would that be?
-Easterly.

233
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,480
Oh, easterly around the church?

234
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,200
You'd set off in an easterly direction
because that's towards where Jerusalem is

235
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
and where the most religious end
of a church is which is in the...?

236
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,160
-East.
-Thank you.

237
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,920
Oh, I know … I know …
I know Christian churches point east.

238
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Yes.

239
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,200
-Well, most do, not all of them.
-Yeah.

240
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Oh go on, just put a bloody line through it
in your ever so cocky fashion.

241
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Matt, it's a flowering plant with
triangular glandular leaves.

242
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,520
What do you mean by glandular leaves?

243
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,400
-Now, just because I read an article…
-That's a good point.

244
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,560
…it doesn't mean I know
what any of it means, and…

245
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,720
but it sounds like this is a joke article,
like people seem to like defacing Wikipedia,

246
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,600
which I think is a terrible idea really.

247
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,520
But it had that phrase.
Before it got onto the details of the leaves

248
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,420
it said it was in the daisy family
-Aww.

249
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,480
And it was also known as western snakeroot.

250
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,040
-Oh, so you know how the last…
-And it can be found flowering in Utah.

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
The last detail of yours there, Gary,
essentially went,

252
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,920
oh, this is plausible, this is... oh no.

253
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,840
You see I was all like,
this is, this is not a thing…

254
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,840
this is not a thing, and then
you came up with "western snakeroot".

255
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
It's a good name.

256
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,960
It's a really good name,
that's a really believable name.

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Yes, because it doesn't sound glandular
in the slightest.

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,720
If it turns out you've misread the phrase
granular or something like that,

259
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,720
I will be deeply, deeply upset.

260
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,320
So close to being a genuine,
real-life dickweed.

261
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,480
There is nothing here that I can immediately
rule someone out on.

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,680
-You've done well.
-He done well!

263
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,400
He has spirit, this one.

264
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,600
-Gary.
-Here we go.

265
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,040
I recognise that you're an expert
in the subject,

266
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,880
I think it may have been the first thing
that went to your head

267
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,240
when you saw something with that sort of Latin,

268
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,800
and I think occidentalis
came in a little bit too late.

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,360
So I'm going to throw that off, also…

270
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
At least he waited!

271
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Unfortunately, I have also just realised
that "occidentalis" does not mean eastern,

272
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,960
that would be the orient,
the occident is the west.

273
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
Hmm.

274
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
wWich means I'm going to rule you out
because the odds, Matt, of you,

275
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
who usually uses the phrase
"left and right" for west and east,

276
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
knowing that occidental works
with western snakeroot,

277
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,160
Matt, I believe you, am I right?

278
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,400
Firstly, f*** you,
I knew occidental meant west.

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,040
Can we just use the phrase "GCSE in Latin"?

280
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,800
Oh yeah!
-Every time.

281
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,000
Every time.

282
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
And yes, it was me.

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,320
Yes!

284
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,440
So that is two points this show to Matt,

285
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,800
two points to me and a deep apology
for forgetting your Latin GCSE.

286
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,040
"Ageratina Occidentalis is a rhizomatous
perennial herb

287
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,200
"growing fuzzy green or purple stems.

288
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,080
"The glandular leaves are triangular
with serrated edges."

289
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
What's a glandular leaf then?

290
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,960
I don't know,
I'm pressing glandular on it.

291
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,000
It'll be a leaf that serves
some function the way a gland does.

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,580
"A gland is defined functionally as a plant
structure which secretes one or more products."

293
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,280
Urrgh.

294
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,160
"This may be located on or near the plant
surface and secrete externally,

295
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,360
"or be internal to the plant
and secrete into a canal or reservoir."

296
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,160
Oh, it's like a fly trappy thing then.

297
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,080
Matt, two points, congratulations,

298
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,480
I think we get a joint victory on this,

299
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,640
through mostly random chance
of whose articles I picked.

300
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,480
Yay!

301
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
I haven't got an outro,
join us next time.

302
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,640
-Bye!
-Bye!

303
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,640
Fade to black.
