1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
You used to get a floppy disk on the cover of a magazine with some software on it

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,660
and if you were really lucky you'd get a really old game that no one wanted to play free

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,590
on the cover of the magazine. Now you can
walk into the shop and purchase a

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,230
magazine with a free computer on the
front.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,780
The Raspberry Pi was developed by the Raspberry Pi foundation as a sort of cheap general-purpose computer

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,240
that could be used to teach people how
computers worked.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,300
So the aim was to try & recreate the home computer boom that was around in the early

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,990
eighties and they took the naming
convention from the BBC Micro

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,559
So they started with the model B and the model A and then just like the BBC micro went to

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,110
the model B plus we have here. They
brought out the model B plus of the

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,280
Raspberry Pi. Quite nice, had a USB port,
Ethernet port to connect to the network

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,360
HDMI-out so you could plug it into your telly and USB from a standard mobile phone charger.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,240
So last Thursday on Twitter [I] saw, as I was getting up in the morning that they'd released a

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,390
new one, the Raspberry Pi Zero and the first thing that immediately hit you was the price...

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,180
$5. Less than the price of a movie ticket at the local cinema. And then I looked down a bit further on Twitter.

16
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,969
and I realize that they were giving them away on the cover of a magazine.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,000
That's how small it is compared to the floppy disk.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,960
[SR> What are  we giving up to have such a cheap piece of kit?]

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,460
It's at least as powerful as the original Raspberry Pi you can clock it up to 1Ghz

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,820
it comes with 512 Meg of RAM. Its about equivalent to a typical desktop or

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,160
laptop machine in the mid 2000's in terms
of CPU speed so what are we actually got here,

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,500
what have we got on it? Well we've
got a microSD slot where we can put in

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,320
an operating system and I've burned one onto an SD card earlier so we should be able to boot it up

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,140
We've got mini HDMI-out to
connect it to your TV so you need a

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,620
mini-HDMI to normal HDMI connector. We
have a USB port so we can plug some peripherals in

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,040
and we have a power socket on a USB port and that's about it

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,240
the other thing we've got is a row of holes
where we can solder in connectors to

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,780
access the GPIO port so we can connect it up to other things like I did last year with the Christmas tree

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,460
So let's connect it up and see what happens I've got an HDMI connector to this screen here

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,020
[SR> Is that a laptop we've got there? ]

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,130
No it's not a laptop this was developed by Motorola

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,209
for the Atrix line of mobile phones and
the idea was that you dock your mobile phone in the

33
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:27,720
back and then be able to use it as if it
was a little computer. Don't think it ever really took off

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,340
but they're great for connecting
things together you've got HDMI input

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,580
and USB connections to the keyboard and mouse. You need a few converters to make it

36
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,060
all work but it's great for hacking with
little things like Raspberry Pi's

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,019
So we've got an HDMI connected to it

38
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,660
to a mini HDMI socket and this is where
things get a little awkward the USB

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,580
connector's a micro USB connector. The sort you'd normally use to charge your mobile phone

40
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,390
but it's being used on this to connect peripherals

41
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,510
so you need to get hold of a converter
before you can use this.

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,700
You're gonna spend more than 4 quid [$5] you're gonna need to buy the converters unless you've already got them

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:09,440
I sort of fashioned my own out a bit of an old motherboard, the cable off my digital camera and some paperclips

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,420
But anyway, it seems to - it serves the purpose.

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,340
So we can connect up our, the keyboard and mouse built in to here.

46
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,020
There we are, that's connected up. Only thing that's left is to connect the power.

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,380
We should see it start to boot up and you'll see the flashing lights.

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,820
There we go, and then on the actual screen we can see Linux booting up

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,360
and I've already configured this, so [it] should in a minute boot me to the desktop

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
and we can start using it as a normal computer.

51
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,620
[SR> There's got to be a drawback, there's gotta to be something - I don't mean to be overly negative but..?]

52
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,380
So in terms of using it I mean

53
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,319
Once you've got it started, we're up & running the Raspbian environment you can use it like any

54
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,620
other Raspberry Pi. If you're a teacher you could get hold of one of these and for 4 quid [$5] give everyone in

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,040
your class their own computer to do some
computer science stuff on it.

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,940
Relatively easy to setup. The instructions for setting up the SD cards are dead easy to set up and if they

57
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,739
destroy it, well at that price it's probably
not much more expensive than the exercise

58
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,059
books they're writing in any way or the
text books that they're working from so it's

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,200
effectively disposable I think.

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,220
[SR> So what sorts of things can we do with it then?]

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,720
Well it comes with some software built in, there're some programming environments

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,700
there's a C compiler in here as well as some Java stuff, Python, Scratch and so on...

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,820
The standard Raspberry Pi environment's all there.

64
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:35,560
The major feature that's missing, and I haven't mentioned it yet, is networking. By default there is no connection to the Internet on there

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,050
you can't plug into an ethernet there's no wifi so if you wanna take it online then

66
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,660
you'll need some sort of adapter so I'm
using a USB to Ethernet adapter to

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,640
connect it to the network and so that works very well so if we run a web browser

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,980
hopefully that will start up in a second.

69
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,960
These machines, they're roughly about the power of the early 2000's but they're good fun to play with

70
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,390
[SR>So they might be slower than what you're used to day to day but...?]

71
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,410
Yeah, it's slower than your typical Mac or PC.

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,380
[SR> I suppose it'd be a bit churlish to say it's a bit slow considering it costs $5]

73
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,620
Well yeah, it depends what you need it for I mean it's fast enough to do some things but other

74
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,770
things you probably want something more powerful. I mean you can stick it behind

75
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,780
your TV and use it to watch movies if you put a wifi dongle on it and stream video to it.

76
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,200
[SR> So what's this, is this coming up with
YouTube is it? ]

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Yep, 's coming up with YouTube. I think the reason it's slow is I have a very dodgy...

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
...adapter here which doesn't seem to work, the keyboard keeps

79
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,990
cutting out as well so don't take this as a view of the speed

80
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,600
So yeah, you are going to have to buy some adapters and if you haven't got a keyboard or a monitor you need one of them

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,820
but it is a fully functional machine & if
you want to learn how to program

82
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,960
or perhaps learn how to do hardware
hacking; you've got the GPIO pins here

83
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,930
which you can solder on some adapters and then you can connect it up to devices like I did the

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,590
Christmas tree last year you could
create one using this and you could hide

85
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,050
this in the box of the Christmas tree
quite easily.

86
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,479
You can get a case for this in fact that's how I actually first saw it was released - I saw the tweet about the case rather than the

87
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,019
actual device, so there are cases available. Probably cost more than the actual device

88
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,960
[SR> Great! so I might go and get myself one!]

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Ah you'll be lucky, they're all sold out!

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
[SR> They've all gone?]

91
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,340
Yes, yes

92
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,410
It seems it was very, very popular. Seem to have sold out of all the ones they've made

93
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,670
I'm sure they'll be making more & they'll be available again soon

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,200
and it's very very difficult for people
who go into a bad place and use a card

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,230
because if if you complain to your bank
then the strip club owner will just say.....
