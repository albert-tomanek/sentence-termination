1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
some of the earlier ideas at digital
money simply took the form of a public ledger.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,140
You  know you start off with money you have a list of who owns how many coins

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,820
and then people call in and say I hereby transfer so many coins to such-and-such

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,280
and you then update the ledger. Now of course in real life

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,369
proper money actually works like that
it's just that the banks don't keep an

6
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,970
infinite publicly visible history of all
the transactions but Bitcoin keeps

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,280
everything publicly visible forever.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,580
The basic idea behind Bitcoin is that you have got thousands of people called Bitcoin miners

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,600
who compete to find the next hash in something called a blockchain. and a new hash is found about every ten minutes.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,780
so what happens is that hundreds of people who want to do a transaction

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,800
- say I want to pay you a
tenth of a Bitcoin (which is about 25 pounds or so)

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,480
pay for lunch or a taxi ride or whatever. Then what I do is I sign a transaction

13
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,920
saying that I pay you 25 pounds and that
gets collected together with hundreds of

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,980
other transactions that people want to
do around the world and Bitcoin miners work on it.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,360
How they work on it is they
look for a random number which

16
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,820
together with the last hash of the blockchain

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,660
and the batch of pending transactions, will have a certain property

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:34,660
and this property is found only about one time every sixty million, million, million attempts

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,040
so you get thousands in fact millions of computers

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,710
around the world working to try and find
the next hash with this special property

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,060
by trying the existing blockchain plus
all the transactions in the queue that

22
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,960
are waiting to be processed and
eventually every 10 minutes or so,

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,759
some lucky person puts up his hand and says "Found it!" and when that happens he gets 25 Bitcoins

24
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,759
so that's the reward for that person for
finding that particular hash.

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,160
The blockchain is a list of all the transactions
that have been done with Bitcoin back

26
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,550
since the first transaction in 2008 or
2009

27
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,090
and it's punctuated with hashes and each
hash binds together the transactions

28
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,960
that happened up to that point in time
and so anybody can look back over the

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,280
blockchain and can trace the origin of
any particular Bitcoin. When it was mined

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,080
right, when it was awarded as a prize
to a miner who found an appropriate hash

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,820
and everybody who spent it or subdivided it or did something else with it since then.

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,700
So it's an open ledger and the history of every single coin is visible to all.

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,680
What you basically do is you add to the block chain basically one hash at a time.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,320
So you start off
with the last hash plus all the

35
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,180
transactions that you've swept together
into a pool to add to the chain and then

36
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,840
there's the hash that you find at the end.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,660
It's also worth saying that miners tend to work in pools and at present there are three large pools which

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,220
distribute the work to tens of thousands of people who then 'beaver away' happily trying to

39
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,050
find the next hash and when the reward
comes through right;

40
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,810
and each of these mining pools will win a reward about once every half hour or so; they then

41
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,440
share that out to the miners who work for
them so what you've ended up with is a

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,760
system whereby people can buy Bitcoin mining equipment, they can plug it in

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,670
they can sign up to a mining pool, and
they get a return on their investment

44
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,600
just as if they'd put money in the bank
although the return is at present slightly better.

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,560
If you're actually paying for your
electricity, half of all the return that

46
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,060
you get on your investment is going to
have to go to pay the electricity bill.

47
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,740
There's a significant problem coming down the line because next year. About a year from now (slightly under a year from now )

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,380
The reward for finding a Bitcoin <<for finding a successful hash >SR>> is due to fall from 25 bitcoins

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,160
per successful hash to twelve and a half. Now when this was set up the inventor

50
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,650
decided that in order to prevent
inflation the number of bitcoins that

51
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,240
you would get would fall over time. So the amount of work that you had to do per Bitcoin

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,080
would increase until finally the amount of Bitcoin in circulation would be stable.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,580
Now this means, that from about October next year <<October 2016>> if you're doing Bitcoing mining

54
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,860
on a fully commercial basis then every dollar that you spend

55
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,000
on electricity will return only one
dollar in expectation and Bitcoins

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,600
rather than $2 at the present time so
there's no way for you to recoup the

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
capital cost of your equipment unless of
course you can place your equipment in

58
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,680
places where electricity is very cheap
or in college dorm rooms where it's free

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
and eventually college deans are gonna
start putting in electricity meters and what then happens to Bitcoin?

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,360
[SR] So is this part of the way that Bitcoin works is that these rules have been set up already

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,560
that over a certain amount of time these things happen?

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Well at present the Bitcoin rules were set up by the anonymous guy who set the system up in 2008...

63
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,240
...and they are maintained by the people who

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,940
maintain the Bitcoin software and so long
as they agree on what the software

65
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,740
should do you have consensus, but if they
were to disagree and fork the system into

66
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,360
two separate universes then that would
have huge consequences just like -

67
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,180
for example if Greece had left the Euro.
There would have been all sorts of trouble to mop up.

68
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,620
Nobody knows for sure who wrote Bitcoin. The person who

69
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,330
claimed authorship Satoshi Nakamoto
appears to be a pseudonym and various

70
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,450
people have been found who might have
been him what we do know is that the

71
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,419
first Bitcoin transaction was made with
Hal Finney who was a cipher-punk

72
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,720
a cryptographer and a coder who could definitely have invented this and come

73
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,570
up with it and he unfortunately died of
Motor Neurone Disease (MND/ALS) a while ago so we

74
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,039
can't now ask him whether it was his
handiwork - he did deny it at the time but

75
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,820
in any case, somebody unknown who may
have been Hal, gave us this amazing and

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,580
fascinating system and as for where it
goes in the long term the answer is I don't know.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,420
The blockchain is a truly wonderful technical innovation. It doesn't quite do

78
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:28,639
what people like cipher-punks originally
thought it would do namely create a

79
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,259
stable anonymous currency that was
beyond the reach of governments

80
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,380
My feeling is that it hasn't quite found a
killer application yet.

81
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,719
If you think of the internet for example back in the mid-nineteen nineties people thought

82
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:48,689
that bringing the Internet to the home
would be absolutely great for basically

83
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:55,240
delivering video to the home so something like you get from your favorite video

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,919
rental service or from your PVR was reckoned to be what people would use the internet for

85
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,110
and of course that turned out to be not
its real application. The real application

86
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,110
of the internet as everybody knows is
disseminating photographs of cats.

87
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,909
So what will be 'cats' for Bitcoin? We don't
know, and whoever figures that out might stand

88
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:20,020
to make quite a few shillings ($$!)

89
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,300
in the back of them,

90
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,320
they put little mobile phones. So that, whenever  you used this terminal it'll it would text your card and PIN details....

91
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,160
You start getting the voltage that represents a six drifting a little bit, and it looks like a seven....
