1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
>>What's the problem with quantum then?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,600
OK, I think we probably... Probably we should talk about the opportunity

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,420
I mean what, what's the idea?

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,200
Why would we want to build a quantum computer?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,780
We discovered... the first observation was

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,060
that it's actually quite difficult to simulate a quantum system.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
and this could be illustrated with this famous double slit experiment

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,740
where you send electrons, or photons or whatever

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
through two slits, and then you notice

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,500
that you get this interference pattern. So it gets dark and light, dark and light

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,960
which we can understand if we think of electrons or photons as waves

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,080
'cause the waves interfere with each other

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,220
but at the same time we know that they are actually particles because we never have half a photon, we never have half an electron

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,480
so the question is, if each time we send only one electron through these slits

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,160
Which way does it go? Does it go left, or right?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,580
and now you think you're clever, you put some detectors on the slits

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,780
You have to 'trick' nature, find out where it goes and as soon as you do this

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,180
they behave like particles, there's no interference pattern any more.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,380
and that's called a measaurement, so all quantum systems

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,320
er they have this dual behaviour, they behave like waves as long as you don't look at them

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,420
and as soon as you look at them, they behave like particles

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,580
behaviour where this electron goes through,

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,620
seems to be going through both holes at the same time

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,000
it's really doing something in parallel

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,480
the one explanation is, er, one understanding is Everett's

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,000
er, multiple worlds interpretation

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,440
that there are parallel universes and in one universe the electron goes through this and the other one through this

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,080
and you don't determine which universe you are

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,620
unless you look at it, and then you are either in this one or in this one

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
OK, now,

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,140
quantum computing tries to exploit this

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,500
very weird nature of quantum physics

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,920
and using the mathematical models we have from physics

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,140
we can develop new computational paradigm, new...

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,880
programming language so to say, quantum programming

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,160
and in this language we can exploit this quantum parallelism

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
to have certain computations run faster

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,940
it's not completely easy because everything you do has to be

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,500
reversible, every computation you do

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,340
you also have to be able to do backwards so everything needs to be symmetric

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,360
>>Is it a Qubit?

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,760
Yes, a Qubit is a bit, and it has an amplitude, it can be

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
somewhere between zero and one, yes?

44
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,840
and a Qubit, which is maybe like, in the middle.

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,020
is like this electron going through the one slit and the other slit and we don't know which one

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,900
so while the Qubit is not observed

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,520
it's at the same time zero and one, so to say.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,260
and all its interaction are based on this "it's two things at the same time," like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat famously (alive and dead)

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,560
so as long as you don't open the box

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,860
the Qubit is in some super-position so to say

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,880
it can be just one but it can be also in a super-position

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
and that's the interesting case

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,660
but the rule is, you're not allowed to look at it while you do this

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,400
so it has to be unobserved

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,600
because once you observe it you determine which universe you are

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,200
then this multiple universe idea disappears, this paralellism disappears

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,360
>>The magic is let out of the box?

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,080
The magic yeah, once you look at it the magic is out

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,860
you have to close your eyes

60
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,860
for as long as you.... then at the end you can look because you want to know what the outcome is

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,700
and then you measure but not inbetween

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,160
There are some, very famous algorithms

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,980
which work on a quantum computer faster

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,900
than on any, known, classical

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,560
there's no known classical solution

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,060
a famous problem

67
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,560
is the problem of factoring a number

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,180
so for example 15 can be factored at 3 and 5

69
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,640
and this problem is actually quite important for

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,780
cryptography. The RSA algorithm

71
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,060
is based on this idea that you have the product of two prime numbers

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,300
but you don't tell anybody what the prime numbers are

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,040
so, it's called a one-way function

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,540
so it's actually surprising, it's easy, computationally to find out whether a number is a prime number

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,440
but it's hard to factor a number

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,980
it's hard (this by the way is not proven)

77
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,620
nobody knows a way to factor a number efficiently on a classical computer

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,600
but since Shor (The Shor Algorithm)

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,400
we know on a hypothetical quantum computer, that using this quantum paralellism

80
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,020
there is a clever way to do this

81
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,980
it uses a certain number theoretic function

82
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,980
which has a period (repeats itself)

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,180
and using this super-position of Qubits

84
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,200
you can actually, with a good probability measure,

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,980
this period, the repetition, and from this period you can then, find a factor

86
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,740
that's quite clever, yeah. So

87
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,060
it seems that quantum computing can...

88
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,340
can be much much faster than classical computing

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,820
now here's the problem

90
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,180
we haven't yet been able to build

91
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,780
a quantum computer of reasonable size, where there's anything interesting happening

92
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,460
and why is this a problem?

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,260
why is it difficult?

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,700
the challenge is to do computations without looking at it

95
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,320
while you have... Your Qubits are represented by some physical object

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,020
some ions or whatever

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,780
some particles, yeah

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,600
and you want these particles to interact with each other to do the quantum computation

99
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,620
But, they should not interact with the rest of the universe

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,680
So you basically have to make them interact with each other, without touching them

101
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,460
and, that could be possible. It may be

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,040
"an engineering problem" as one says

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,620
But we don't know whether

104
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,720
whether it's actually possible in principle

105
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,000
I think there is a mistake to extrapolate, we know in small systems

106
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,060
we have this quantum behaviour, and quantum

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
er, theory gives us very, very good predictions on how these systems behave

108
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,400
but we don't know

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,040
whether it actually scales up. Whether

110
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,140
I mean, there is this problem that you have

111
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,660
involuntary measurements, or involuntary observations

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
it's called decoherence

113
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,580
so when this system loses its quantum magic and becomes classical

114
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
and what we don't know is

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,060
whether we can actually avoid decoherence in a large quantum system

116
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,900
because in the end, in physics it's always like this:

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,560
"You should never assume an outcome of an experiment before you have done it"

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,480
so far, nobody has done this experiment which shows that large scale quantum computing is actually possible

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,420
so it may be that there is some hidden law we haven't yet been able to test ya?

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,800
which basically says "Once you do too much quantum parallelism, nature...

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,980
...shakes its head and says no that's getting too complicated I'm not doing this,

122
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,660
I'm going to put some decoherence in otherwise it gets too complicated

123
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,220
it could be, I'm not saying it is like this but we basically don't know

124
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,680
So I think research in quantum computing in this area

125
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,640
is very interesting, very exciting, because we have actually an open question

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,520
and either way the answer will be interesting

127
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,560
The answer is either, OK we can build a quantum computer, we can do all these cool algorithms, great.

128
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,340
Or the answer could be, Actually it's impossible we have discovered a new law of nature

129
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,440
which actually says that nature in the end is classical and this quantum stuff is only on a small scale

130
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,840
which would be very very exciting as well

131
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,640
Either way it's exciting, we should find out, but we shouldn't

132
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,080
assume now that we know the answer without having done the experiment

133
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,100
>>There's supposed to be some kind of computer that's been built

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah

135
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,300
>>Is it that we don't know if it is doing what we guess?

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,360
Yes there's this D-Wave and there are other projects, but as far as I know

137
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,700
we don't know yet whether really get quantum paralellism out of it

138
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,280
there are all sorts of claims and counter-claims and I don't think it has been decided yet

139
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,880
>>Is it possible to simulate a quantum computer on a classical computer?

140
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,260
Yes indeed, er, I've actually developed a library

141
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,360
doing exactly this, called Quantum IO Monad

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,200
Yes you can do this, the problem is, to simulate this quantum paralellism

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,000
you have to really go through all the possibilities and you have an overhead

144
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
exponential overhead

145
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,520
so yes you can simulate it, but it's inefficient

146
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,260
>>So could you do a very simple sum or something like that on this?

147
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,240
Yes we did this algorithm, the Shor algorithm

148
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,340
to factor a number and to factor 15 and it turns out, the answer is either 3 or 5...

149
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,180
[laugh]

150
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,200
>>Is that something we could link to, people could look at or is it err....

151
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,120
yes, yes

152
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,060
>>Cool well we'll put that in the description if anybody is interested in it

153
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,320
it's actually implemented in the programming language Haskell, the functional language

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,440
I hope you can still download the code!
