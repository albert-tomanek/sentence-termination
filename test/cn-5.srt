1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,330
This is the Technical Difficulties,

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,430
and we are playing
Two Of These People Are Lying

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,100
because two of these people will be.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,330
- Chris Joel.
- Hello!

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,163
Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:08,057
And Churchill said to me,

7
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,440
"If you've been wearing a thong
the wrong way around for 25 years,

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,420
"you deserve to be
in the Camel Corps."

9
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,535
And Matt Gray!

10
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:16,010
I like how I have to try and explain it

11
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,960
while still laughing at you,
every single time.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,990
The three of us have
picked a Wikipedia article,

13
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,610
you probably know it by now,

14
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,460
and then Tom is shuffling them.
He's going to pick one.

15
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,160
Two of us will be lying
about what that article is,

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,520
one of us will be telling the truth.

17
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,070
And we are talking about, Hagia Sophia.

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,470
Hag-ee-a Sophia, Hog-ee-u...

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,140
Matt, how do you pronounce it?

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,150
Hagia Sophia.

21
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,681
I have no idea, I'm just reading
it the same way as you.

22
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,522
- Oh, okay, right.
- It's a band.

23
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,355
It's a band, all right.

24
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:48,830
- Uh, Gary.
- It is a museum in Istanbul.

25
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,260
Museum in Istanbul, and Chris.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,960
It is the site of a
well-known piece of graffiti.

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,410
Ooh.

28
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,730
That is interesting enough,
we're going to start with it.

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,360
Chris, site of a well-known
piece of graffiti.

30
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,720
Yeah, it is a holy-site-cum-temple,
somewhere in the Near East,

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,640
but it's noted for having
a piece of Viking graffiti

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,710
that effectively boils down
to, "Halfdan was here."

33
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,620
- Halfdan?
- Halfdan!

34
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,840
It's a good Viking name.
I presume.

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,560
Presumably he wrote it one-handed
and hopped in or something, I dunno.

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,580
Is that a whole name, Halfdan?

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,400
- Yeah, I think it's Halfdan. You know.
- Right.

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,820
You could probably do
with the right letters.

39
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,420
- Right. Okay.
- I can't.

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,120
Gary, a museum in Istanbul.

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,880
Yes, it has a big dome.

42
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,791
I mean, a lot of places in Istanbul do.

43
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,860
Yeah, indeed they do, it's a former site

44
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,570
of an orthodox Christian
church, later a mosque,

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,210
now a museum noted for
interesting things within it,

46
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,330
as you often get in former converted site.

47
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,190
I mean, generally museums are known
for interesting things within them.

48
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,555
- Yes.
- Mmm...

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,700
I dunno, some museums...

50
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,800
Did you go to the
Colour Museum in Bradford?

51
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,616
- The what?
- The what?

52
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:01,290
- The Colour Museum.
- Is it just, like, samples of colours?

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,570
Yeah, because because Bradford used to
be the centre of the wool dying trade.

54
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,445
- So you have the colour--
- Oh.

55
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,440
You have the Wool Dyers Association,
who set up a museum of colour,

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,230
and how you doing dying and colours.

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,170
I was about to write that down,

58
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,400
realised it's got nothing
to do with this whatsoever.

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,620
- It hasn't, no.
- Do carry on.

60
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,251
But an interesting little
vignette for you there.

61
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,330
Yes, the museum in
Istanbul with a big dome.

62
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,943
Yeah, and things within it.

63
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,500
What can I say?

64
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,640
Some of the things within it
would be a start!

65
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,360
Right, there's doors.

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm not pissing about, there's doors.

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,470
There's the Emperor's Door,
which was a door

68
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,820
that would be proceeded
through by emperors.

69
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,818
There's what was described
as the Nice Door,

70
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:40,518
which is a particularly
fine example, and--

71
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:44,880
There's the back door,
and then the side door.

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,250
And a Sweaty Column.

73
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,083
I beg your pardon?

74
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,580
A sweaty, it's described
as the Sweating Column.

75
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,426
The stone perspires.

76
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,120
- It is very euphemistic.
- Yeah.

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,580
Sweating or sweaty?

78
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,010
Well, either probably fits, does it not?

79
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,080
The one causes the other.

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,520
The Sweaty Column and a load of doors
in a museum in Istanbul with a big dome.

81
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,210
Correct, that's not...
that's genuinely what that is.

82
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,460
Because the Sweating Column
is where the heat transfers

83
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,293
and the water comes out,

84
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:09,930
and obviously it's been
used as a devotional thing,

85
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,060
'cause it heals ailments
and stuff like that.

86
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,960
Does it, though?

87
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,633
Yeah?

88
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,120
Site of controversy, obviously.

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,050
Erdogan in Turkey has tried
to bring it back into religious use.

90
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,460
All right, Matt, it's a band.

91
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,390
They're a folk band.

92
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,850
Folk band, right, okay.

93
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,480
And they are from the Scottish Highlands.

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,350
Scottish Highlands.

95
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,750
And I've, once again, I
should've done more research.

96
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,440
I've picked another article
that didn't have too much on it,

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,030
so I clicked through to their website,

98
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,440
and they are playing
Chelmsford Folk Festival on Thursday.

99
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,370
- Oh.
- I mean, that's unhelpful

100
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,750
for everyone who's
watching this months later.

101
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,200
- Yeah, but--
- Yeah, but it's good for us.

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Who'd have thought Chelmsford
would have a folk festival?

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,480
It seems like reasonable
place to have a folk festival.

104
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,550
- If it was the, the, the--
- The, the, the, the--

105
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,790
But then again, it's a
place with folk in it,

106
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,373
so I suppose it can work
for a folk festival.

107
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,123
It's a festival of folk.

108
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,730
Just a long parade of random people.

109
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,720
This is a folk, here's some folk.

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,450
So they're playing Chelmsford
Folk Festival on Thursday.

111
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,882
- Yes.
- And I looked through to their website.

112
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,901
The Wikipedia doesn't
list any articles or...

113
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,350
albums or singles or anything,
which intrigued me,

114
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,810
which is the main reason I
clicked on their website.

115
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,980
They have a Bandcamp.

116
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,380
- So they just release stuff in fits and starts.
- Nice.

117
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,135
Why do they qualify for
a Wikipedia article?

118
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,600
Is it just like someone from
the band's made this, or...

119
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,640
♪ It's called a stub... ♪

120
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,194
It didn't say it was a stub,
but it was stub length.

121
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:47,590
I like how I can't get a whole sentence out
without being interrupted today.

122
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,140
Do you like that?
'Cause it'd really annoy me.

123
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,580
Well, it's handy the times
I was making things up,

124
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,900
because then I had more time to think.

125
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,210
But yeah, it was a short article.

126
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,370
It didn't complain about being a stub,
or just being promotional,

127
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,824
but I think it's so small no one cares.

128
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:05,010
All right. Man.

129
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,100
Gary, I don't think it's the museum.

130
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,933
Okay.

131
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,410
I think there are a lot
of places like that,

132
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,110
but I think it fell apart
on the phrase Sweaty Column.

133
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,610
As has often been the
problem in my career.

134
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,430
Chris, I think that's a
genuine piece of graffiti,

135
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,000
I just think it's probably
not in that place.

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
I don't think that that works.

137
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,020
Matt, I think it's a folk band with
a tiny stub article. Am I right?

138
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,020
- No!
- Oh, no.

139
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,530
Okay, did you just make that
up with no detail whatsoever?

140
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,906
Yes.

141
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:38,120
Right, well you get the
point, and the question is,

142
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,020
Chris, should I have picked you again?

143
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,520
No... however.

144
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,680
So, the Hagia Sophia.
Yep.

145
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,110
Is a near-Eastern religious site.

146
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,532
Yeah, that's what you said.

147
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:54,770
It is now a museum, with
a sweaty column in it

148
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,530
that exists in much the
way that Gary describes it.

149
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,233
Oh, had Gary picked an article that
you already knew something about?

150
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:04,607
And, it has in it a piece of
Viking graffiti what says,

151
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,307
"Halfdan was here."

152
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:10,350
I don't understand.

153
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,140
Gary's was true, but I
knew something about it.

154
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,970
But enough not to tread on his toes.

155
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,700
So you're both right?

156
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,740
I'm so confused!

157
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,580
So only one of these people
were lying!

158
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,970
"At the northwest of the building,

159
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,670
"there is a column with
a hole in the middle,

160
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,190
"covered by bronze plates.

161
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,490
"The column goes by different names,
The Perspiring Column,

162
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,500
"The Wishing Column, the Sweaty Column,
or the Crying Column."

163
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,885
So you were both--

164
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,130
"The column is said to be damp when
touched and has supernatural powers,

165
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,800
"because St. Gregory the Miracle-Worker
appeared near the column in 1200,

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,910
"and since then it has been moist."

167
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,030
So I could have picked either of you.

168
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,030
If you'd've picked me, you
would've technically been wrong.

169
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,230
Not my article, but that is
a true fact about that place.

170
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,260
Oh, that's cruel.

171
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,960
That's cruel, but it doesn't matter
because I picked the one person--

172
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
Who was definitely lying.

173
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,456
Excellent, lovely.

174
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,290
Gary, go get yourself a new article.

175
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,040
We'll be back in a moment.

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,570
Gary has gone and got a new article.
I'm going to pick one off here.

177
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,580
And for the second half,
we are talking about Batlow.

178
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,460
Batlow.

179
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,770
Starting with Gary on this one, I think.

180
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,790
Gary, could you please
tell me about Batlow?

181
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,570
Batlow is a river in North Yorkshire.

182
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,860
All right, that's exactly what I thought
it was, looking at that title.

183
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,380
Fair enough. It has the unique distinction
of being the shortest river in the county.

184
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,090
Shortest in the county.

185
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,380
Being three feet long.

186
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,616
I'm laughing at the look on Tom's face.

187
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,580
The River Batlow is, in fact, an trench.

188
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,990
In the geography community,
that is why it is notable

189
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,640
in that there is obviously a lot of debate
over whether it is a river

190
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,650
or just, ya know, a big trenchy puddle.

191
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,840
Well, it's a small trench.
I's not even a big trench.

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,910
But because it's on a slope,
it has a feeder at the top.

193
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,510
so it's got a spring at
the top that's feeding it.

194
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,182
Just playing the same set
over and over again.

195
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,280
- And it flows--
- Has it got a CD player, player, player?

196
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,700
Yes, it has.

197
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,696
If you were to park next to it,
which is very difficult--

198
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,400
And one leather seat that's
been thrown in there.

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,860
And it could, because it flows--

200
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,820
With cider.

201
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,640
Into another larger--

202
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,906
Lemon.

203
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,238
F***ing hell. Into another larger tributary,

204
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:17,960
therefore it classes under the definition
of what people say is rivers, as a river.

205
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,010
Now, do you remember back when
we did the first run of these?

206
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,843
Yeah?

207
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,743
That I was quite rude
in one of the early episodes.

208
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:28,123
I just kind of immediately struck one off,
because I didn't believe it at all.

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,100
Tell ya what, readers, let's see how
this one pans out

210
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,000
for Colonel Cockypants sat diagonally--

211
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,940
Unfortunately, unfortunately,
the thing that killed it

212
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,800
was "three feet", because --
and you weren't to know this, Gary,

213
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,750
you weren't to know this.

214
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,630
But by the time this episode
of the show has gone out,

215
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,118
I will have done a video
about the shortest rivers in the world.

216
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:52,556
- Oh, s***.
- And--

217
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:54,889
I mean, I vouchsafe your
research came up short.

218
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,560
- Ahh.
- Hey, short!

219
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,393
Chris.

220
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,810
Batlow.

221
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,910
Batlow is a small village in Shropshire.

222
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,050
Village in Shropshire, yep, and Matt.

223
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,530
It's a town in New South Wales.

224
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,610
Town in New South Wales, ah.

225
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,930
The same place in Australia
you went for last time,

226
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,220
when you needed to quickly grab--

227
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,654
Oh s***, it was, wasn't it?

228
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,140
Oh, this might be a quick one.

229
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,840
- All right, let's, let's... let's go.
- That's what you usually say.

230
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,280
Oh, you've wounded him
with your striking out.

231
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,850
I'm going to ask both of you,
and take this in whichever order you like,

232
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,493
what is significant about those towns?

233
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,620
Mine's not a town, you weren't listening.

234
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,670
- It's a village.
- It's a village.

235
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,070
What is significant
about those conurbations?

236
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,040
- Apples.
- That's a strong start.

237
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,290
I think he's talking about mine.

238
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,760
- Apples, what about 'em?
- Remember we touched on

239
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,120
- the Big Lobster in the past?
- Oh yes.

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
- LOBBO!
- LOBBO!

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,220
A long, long time ago.

242
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,900
Can we get one of those
link bubbles, please?

243
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,410
Just 'cause it is the primogenesis
of this horrible mistake.

244
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,975
Originally founded in the late 1800s,

245
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,672
as a place where there was gold.

246
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:01,577
- Someone went, "Hey look--"
- Gold!

247
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,900
"Bet there's some gold here."

248
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,360
Then the gold ran out,
and then they went--

249
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,203
"There's no gold here!"

250
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:06,450
Oh, let's grow some apples.

251
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,400
- I mean, that's--
- In the gold mine.

252
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,440
It's in Wynyard County.

253
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,624
Wynyard County, not Vineyard County.

254
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:13,994
Wynyard County.

255
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:15,341
Yeah, Wynyard County.

256
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,307
It's spelled W-Y-N yard.

257
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:18,474
Oh, Wynyard.

258
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,840
Wynyard County, all right.

259
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,930
Ahh, that's all possible.
I don't see anything wrong with that.

260
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,377
Chris, the village in Shropshire.

261
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,700
Batlow? Formerly a hamlet?

262
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,533
All right.

263
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,480
Became a village in 1953,

264
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,760
when it eventually grew large
enough to be listed as such?

265
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,593
All right.

266
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,030
Named for Battle Low,

267
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,309
the low ground on which the
battle was fought in 1210?

268
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,142
Oh!

269
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:44,975
It's a difficult one.

270
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,420
I mean, it's not a
difficult one with Gary,

271
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,178
but it's a difficult one
between Chris and Matt.

272
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:50,940
Pff, careful--

273
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,410
It's a good job he's drinking
out of a mug,

274
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,900
I think you'd have been glassed by now.

275
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,763
Yeah, all I've got to say is one thing:
"Careful, Icarus."

276
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:00,403
It was just a really
unlucky guess, that's all!

277
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,990
If it turns out it is, then frankly--

278
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,420
You've got another f***ing
video to make, haven't you?

279
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,540
If it is, if it is,

280
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,206
I didn't need to go to
Finland for that video.

281
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,936
Is that a humble brag?
I think it might be.

282
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:15,769
It totally is.

283
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,563
- And you've been to Finland?
- Uh-huh.

284
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,551
Did you go through the airport?

285
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,384
That's right, you went to Finland--

286
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,217
Yes, I did!

287
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,050
You're really good at things in Finland

288
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,730
and scotching them out
quickly, aren't you, Tom?

289
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,970
Because you knew all about the airport,
and the little kebab.

290
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,840
So maybe the short river
in Finland, maybe--

291
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,930
Sorry, the short river where?

292
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,600
In Finland, as you just said,

293
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,050
might be where you come up
short in Finnish things.

294
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,723
Matt, I think it's you.

295
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,400
I think it's your village
in New South Wales,

296
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,233
am I right?

297
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,290
Yes, its town sign says
Batlow with a big apple,

298
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,560
and underneath it says Famous for Apples.

299
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,640
I don't know why I'm miming it,
I can show you a picture.

300
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,960
That's great, I need that.

301
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,370
I mean, you know what,
that's on the nose enough, I like that.

302
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,550
Don't mess around.

303
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,580
Famous for apples.

304
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,263
It is named after a Mr. Batlow,

305
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,423
who surveyed a town site
nearby the mining area,

306
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:05,501
and was renamed Batlow in 1889.

307
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,334
What was it called before?

308
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,940
Please tell me it had a proper crappy name
like S*** Creek or something like that.

309
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,540
Yes! Reedy Creek.

310
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,310
That's the name for Disneyland--
Disney World's area, isn't it, Reedy Creek?

311
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,143
- Is it?
- Yeah.

312
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,040
It was established around
the Reedy Flat post office.

313
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,730
- Ahh.
- Reedy Flat.

314
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,810
Who was posting letters there
if there's no one living there?

315
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,550
That was a really unlucky
thread to go on, Gary.

316
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,970
I would've absolutely gone for it.

317
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,150
It was the words "three feet" that gave you,

318
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,140
if you'd have said 20 metres,
if you'd said 100

319
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,160
I'd have completely gone for it.

320
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,670
But a three-foot river?

321
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,560
Could happen.

322
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,670
It would be a puddle, mate.

323
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,940
If anyone's done research
in the last two months, it's him.

324
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,293
Yeah, but what makes a river then?

325
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:47,244
Cause I thought if it's got
a feed water at the top--

326
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,100
Well, you'll just have to watch the video.

327
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,716
Self-promoting f***!

328
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,239
Chris, sorry it was--

329
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,238
No, it's fine.

330
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:59,333
It was a tough choice between
two plausible towns there.

331
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,204
We still don't have an outro.

332
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:02,620
Bye!
